# 🛡️ Automated Fake News Monitoring & Awareness Platform

> **An end-to-end automated system for detecting misinformation, generating evidence-backed corrections using RAG, and visualizing how fake news spreads across digital platforms.**

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Automated Fake News Monitoring & Awareness Platform** is a fully automated, user-facing web application that continuously monitors news sources, identifies potential misinformation, and presents verified corrections through a transparent and explainable pipeline.

The platform is designed for **public awareness and decision support**, not for manual fact-checking or user-submitted verification.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automatically collect news content from multiple sources
- Detect fake, verified, or unverified news using ML and heuristic signals
- Provide **evidence-grounded explanations** using a RAG pipeline
- Track and visualize misinformation spread across platforms
- Deliver insights via a clean, real-time dashboard

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- **Automation-first** – no manual user input
- **Explainability over black-box decisions**
- **Separation of concerns**
- **Responsible AI usage**
- **Deployment-ready architecture**

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1️⃣ Automated Web Scraping
- Runs on a scheduled basis (cron jobs)
- Executes twice daily
- Collects:
  - News content
  - Source URL
  - Platform name
  - Timestamp
- Fully backend-driven (no user trigger)

---

### 2️⃣ Fake News Classification Engine  
**(Decision Layer)**

Responsible for determining the **status of news items**.

#### Techniques Used
- Rule-based heuristics (panic words, urgency, clickbait)
- Source credibility scoring
- Optional pretrained ML classifier (pattern-based)

#### Output Labels
- ❌ Fake
- ✅ Verified
- ⚠️ Unverified

> ⚠️ Breaking or insufficiently corroborated news is explicitly marked *Unverified*.

---

### 3️⃣ RAG Explainability Pipeline  
**(Explanation Layer)**

RAG is **not** used to decide truth.

It is applied **after classification** to:
- Retrieve trusted, stored evidence
- Generate grounded explanations
- Provide corrected context for fake news

#### Purpose of RAG
- Reduce hallucination risk
- Improve transparency
- Increase user trust

#### Example Output
> “This news is marked as fake because no official alert has been issued by any verified authority based on retrieved records.”

🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

No user-submitted news

No chatbot interface

No manual verification buttons

No RAG-based decision logic

No real-time claim of absolute truth

⚖️ Ethical Considerations

The system does not assert factual certainty

Designed as a decision-support & awareness tool

Clearly distinguishes verified, fake, and unverified information

Avoids generative speculation

🧑‍⚖️ Reviewer / Judge Summary

This platform demonstrates a responsible AI approach to misinformation detection by combining automated monitoring, ML-based classification, and RAG-powered explainability, all delivered through a scalable and transparent dashboard.

🚀 Future Enhancements
