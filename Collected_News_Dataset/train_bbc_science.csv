2025-12-27,The prehistoric shark found in a suburban town in Scotland,science,BBC,"Think of sharks and the most common images that spring to mind will likely be of dangerous predators hunting prey, accompanied by ominous music. However, a town in the leafy suburbs of Glasgow has its own connection to the famous fish - and it dates back millions of years. In 1982 a complete shark fossil was discovered in Bearsden, in East Dunbartonshire. It was so complete experts could even see the remains of the last meal eaten by the fish, 330 million years after it died. Now a group of local enthusiasts are hoping to install a sculpture of the fish in the town, ensuring the tale of the Bearsden Shark will be remembered for future generations. The one metre long shark - officially named as the Akmonistion zangerli - was discovered at the Manse Burn in Bearsden, among dozens of other fish and plant samples found during an excavation of the site. According to local legend, some boys in the area had discovered fossils and brought them to the attention of Bearden , at that time working at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. He arranged for the excavation to take place throughout the summer of 1982, with the Bearsden shark the most exciting find. ""It's the most complete fossil shark of any kind, anywhere, of any age,"" says Dr Neil Clark, the curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian. ""It's totally preserved, so every vertebrae and every tooth is in the place it was when it was alive. It's a very useful fossil for understanding what these sharks are like, as before we usually worked with just pieces of teeth or the head. ""For something like the megalodon (usually portrayed in as gigantic) we have no idea how big it really was because we just have the teeth to go on. ""These sharks became extinct during the Triassic period when around 96 per cent of creatures died out – that was far more than during the Cretaceous period which marked the end of the dinosaurs. "" Given this was hundreds of millions of years ago, Scotland bore no resemblance to the land it is today, instead being located near the equator. ""What is now Bearsden was part of a lagoon,"" explains Neil Buchanan, an enthusiast on the shark. ""That lent to the type of fish that were there, shrimps and the like. Then there was some sort of catastrophic event for the shark, which killed it, but it seemed to sink into mud."" Yet while soft tissue usually rots away, the lack of oxygen caused by the manner of the shark's death and more mud landing on top preserved the fish. would now like to see a sculpture in the town as a memento of the shark. ""People are beginning to forget about it, "" he says. ""You mention the Bearsden shark to people and sometimes they have no idea about it. ""One of the things we have come to realise is that the site itself is isolated from the population, so we came up with the idea of a permanent display in the town centre. ""The quality would hopefully be attractive enough for people locally to look at, and maybe even have visitors come."" Despite the shark being so well preserved, Dr Clark says there remain many mysteries about the fish found in a Bearsden burn. ""There is still a lot to be found out about them, especially the structure behind the head,"" he explains. ""There are a lot of different theories. At the time it was found they thought maybe it arched its back and make it look like a huge mouth, but it's so narrow it wouldn't actually look like a mouth, so that theory is out the window. ""Another theory has it as a male shark and perhaps it was a purpose in mating, like for scratching females. ""There is still so much more to be found about these creatures, but we may never discover it. ""Research is still ongoing regarding the things dug out of Bearsden and there's always something new coming out from them - that's what is so magical about it.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5jvel0pqo
2025-12-27,'Deep time' geological trail planned for Highland village,science,BBC,"A coastal trail exploring the history of some of western Europe's oldest rocks has been proposed for a Wester Ross village. Gairloch's geology includes Lewisian gneiss and Torridonian sandstone, rocks that were formed millions of years ago. Gairloch Museum plans to build the new route to the village's Carn Dearg Youth Hostel. Roy Macintyre, one of those leading the project, said the trail would celebrate , the geological history of Earth over billions of years. Mr Macintyre said: ""Gairloch is a favourite haunt for geologists. ""In Gairloch, Lewisian gneiss and its various associated rocks are mostly exposed on the surface so it's easy to interpret them."" He said the trail's length in kilometres - 4.5km - was also significant. ""The age of the solar system is generally accepted to be 4.0 to 4.5 billion years,"" he said. The route would have 18 markers representing different geological periods, such as the Triassic and Jurassic. The proposals have been put to Highland Council and the new trail could potentially be open next year. Lewisian gneiss are colourful, banded rocks named after the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles. They were formed in a process that involved the rocks' minerals being heated and squeezed deep below the Earth's surface. Many of the striking mountains in the north west Highlands are formed of Torridonian sandstone - including Quinag, Suilven and Liathach.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd5nw0y0no
2025-12-26,'We're still waiting for flood defences - 10 years on from bridge collapse',science,BBC,"Ten years on from the devastating Christmas floods which swept away Tadcaster's  18th Century bridge, people in the North Yorkshire market town are calling for ""no more delays"" to long-awaited flood defence works. The Grade II listed stone bridge across the River Wharfe was destroyed on 29 December 2015 - splitting the community in two - and was not fully reopened until February 2017. In late 2024, the Environment Agency submitted a planning application for a multimillion-pound flood defence scheme to North Yorkshire Council. Last autumn,  officials asked for extra time to review it. Paula Marr, whose business Genesis Hair Design was flooded in 2015 and again in 2022, said: ""It's been 10 years and we're no further forward. We need spades in the ground."" An Environment Agency spokesperson said the agency remained ""fully committed"" to delivering a scheme which protects Tadcaster from future flooding. The request for a ""short"" extension to review the planning application followed concerns raised during the planning process, they added. Recalling the 2015 flood which came after days of heavy rain over the Christmas period, Ms Marr said: ""I'd just left the salon and taken my wellies off when the bridge collapsed in 2015. ""I came straight back down - it was unbelievable to see the damage. ""It's always looming in the background. It's always in the back of your mind, 'what if it comes up again?' It's imperative that we get those defences."" Ms Marr, who owns the building she trades from, said she could no longer get insurance cover for flooding. ""I was offered cover last year with a £75,000 excess, which obviously I didn't go for,"" she said. She has also called for the government to set up a ""business interruption cover"" fund, so traders can pay their staff if they are forced to temporarily close by any future floods. ""It's up to me to put money away to put the building back together, but it would be good for peoples' peace of mind to know their wages are covered for a period of time if there's more flooding,"" she added. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the government inherited flood defences in the ""worst condition"" on record. They said ministers were investing at least £10.5bn across England until 2036 to better protect nearly 900,000 properties. But to expand a government and insurance industry scheme known as Flood Re, set up to support households in high flood risk areas, would require ""an additional significant levy,"" they added. ""That would raise costs for small businesses and consumers."" A few doors down from Ms Marr's Commercial Street business, Richard High, who runs The Coffee Club, said the recent wet weather - along with the flood defence delay - had been causing him sleepless nights. ""I'm checking apps on my phone in the night, wondering if the business will be gone in the morning. ""Nobody will insure us - those defences need to be done straight away. ""You build a business knowing it could be gone in one night. ""My message to the Environment Agency is 'please just get it sorted."" A short distance away, dog walker Judy Noble described the bridge collapse as a ""surreal moment"" as it started to sink in that the town had been cut in two. ""I can't understand why they are waiting so long to get the defences built,"" she said. ""Do they need a recurrence of what happened 10 years ago? ""I know there is no funding out there, but we are talking about peoples' lives. ""With climate change we can't predict the weather, and they aren't thinking 'Is it going to happen again?' They're thinking 'When is it going to happen again?'"" The Environment Agency spokesperson said: ""It is important that we take the time to address the issues raised and ensure the scheme has the best chance of securing planning consent, as we know how important this project is for the town.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgj5l0l0vno
2025-12-27,People 'traumatised' by PFAS threat - expert,science,BBC,"The chair of a panel which tested Jersey's food and soil for ""forever chemicals"" believes people have been ""traumatised"" by contamination fears. The independent scientific advisory panel found of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and most were below EU safety limits. PFAS, known as ""forever chemicals"" because they take a long time to break down,  have previously been including including kidney and testicular cancer. Dr Steve Hajioff said the test results had been reassuring, but it had been difficult to convince some people to believe the reports. ""I think there are people who have been traumatised by the fear of contamination in the past,"" Dr Hajioff said. ""I can understand completely why they would be upset and distressed by that."" In the early 1990s, foam which contained PFAS and was used on Jersey Airport's fire training ground leaked into the neighbouring area and private borehole water supplies. In May, consultants found the affected area near the airport was Dr Hajioff said he believed people often ""felt scared"" when water supplies might be contaminated or as clean as desired. Jersey Water said its tests showed the water supply was Dr Hajioff added he thought he would probably become ""the person nobody trusts"" when he was appointed to chair the panel. ""You do the best that you possibly can,"" he said. ""You convince the bulk of people that you've behaved in a trustworthy fashion, and just accept that there are going to be people on either side of an argument who will never be satisfied."" The environment minister is due to respond to the panel's draft recommendations for managing PFAS in February.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwylxn63044o
2025-12-26,Historic forest to grow with mass tree planting,science,BBC,"A forest will be extended for the first time in more than 200 years as plans to plant 120,000 this winter get under way. After buying Hoarthorn's Farm in late 2024, Forestry England will plant thousands of trees at the 88-hectare (217 acre) site near Berry Hill in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. Tom Brockington, area manager for Forestry England, said the move is ""very significant"" with between 1,000 and 1,500 trees being planted per day in the forest's It is hoped the trees of varying species will support wildlife and mitigate the effects of climate change, he added. Trees in the Forest of Dean have been harvested and replanted for more than a century, but Forestry England is now extending it beyond its traditional boundary, Mr Brockington said. Geological and soil surveys were carried out to work out which trees would be best supported in each area of the site, and consideration was given to how wildlife could move around the site. ""Biodiversity requires a buffering of established wildlife hotspots,"" Mr Brockington said. ""We want to be able to create those linkages where animals can move between established woodland and other established woodland... so we've chosen trees that support that transfer of species."" In terms of climate change, Mr Brockington said having a variety of species means, if one is susceptible to disease, a significant number of trees will not be lost. ""We are looking at western France, because it's a very similar climate to what we could expect in our country in 40 to 50 years' time, which would be when these trees are reaching maturity,"" he added. ""So we need to be thinking about which trees might be drought susceptible or resilient."" A central area of the site will be left as pasture, which will be grazed by cattle during the winter, and it is hoped all 120,000 trees will be in the ground by the end of March.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c208dwyqgp1o
2025-12-26,'10 years ago today the floods changed everything in a moment',science,BBC,"Adrian Horton's memories of the flooding which hit parts of West Yorkshire during Christmas 2015 as Storm Eva battered the region remain clear 10 years on. The storm hit Adrian's home town of Hebden Bridge, in the Calder Valley, as people were still celebrating Christmas. It brought with it more than 2.4ins (60mm) of rain in a 24-hour period which followed two months of wet weather and saw river levels rise rapidly because of the saturated ground. The Calder Valley was among the areas worst affected, with water cascading off hills and turning roads into rivers in towns like Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd. Having endured six major floods since 2000, preparation for flooding has now become part of everyday life in places like Hebden Bridge - but the experiences of 2015 are scarred on the memories of many people. ""When we woke on Boxing Day, the river was touching our back garden wall,"" Katie Kimber, a Calderdale councillor, remembers. ""It was shocking - the volume and and the speed."" Meanwhile, fellow councillor Scott Patient says: ""Everything changed in one moment."" ""Every year, you think about what happened: waking up, water lapping at your door. Having to pull everything from downstairs, worrying about neighbours, your kids' school, looking at what seems like something out of a film,"" he says. ""The trauma, the PTSD, people who were stuck in their homes reliant on rescue. It stays with you."" Across West Yorkshire, communities suffered an estimated £150m worth of damage. In Bradford, towns like Bingley, Shipley and Saltaire were worst hit. Chris Hicks, chairman of Saltaire Cricket Club, says he ""never wants to see"" flooding like it again. The club sits next to the River Aire, and in 2015 most of the ground was submerged, including the pavilion, two shipping containers full of equipment and the Half Moon Cafe. ""We talk about flooding once in 21 years, or once in 100 years - those are just statistics,"" he says. Once the river levels subsided, 328ft (100m) of silt was deposited on the outfield and it was only the sheer effort of staff, volunteers and players that saw the ground readied for the next season. Mr Hicks, now 67, says: ""The biggest difference now, in terms of mitigation, is the work they have done upstream. ""If you go up to Skipton, they let the flood plain flood, they let the water go where it wants to go. ""That has alleviated the problems downstream. ""In a situation like that, there really is nothing you can do, but I do have a store of sandbags which are readily accessible."" In Leeds, the River Aire reached its highest ever level of 17ft (5.2m) when Storm Eva struck. Its normal flow rate of 15 tonnes per second turned into an unprecedented 360 tonnes of water per second. James Lewis, now leader of Leeds City Council, remembers 26 December 2015 as ""untold misery"". ""The Boxing Day floods of 2015 directly impacted thousands of people and hundreds of businesses across the city,"" he says. However, he says that 10 years on, the city can ""take pride"" in the response to the ""dreadful day"". He praises what he calls the ""decade of dedication, partnership working and teamwork that delivered some of the UK's most robust flood defence infrastructure"". The first phase of the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme, known as FAS 1, was completed in 2017. FAS 1 stretches from Leeds Station to Woodlesford using technology that was the first of its kind in the UK. The works involved merging the River Aire and canal at Knostrop Cut, building new embankments and two movable weirs at Knostrop and Crown Point. Phase two introduced several miles of linear flood defences, pumping stations and flow control structures. Meanwhile, a flood storage area near Calverley holds the equivalent of 720 Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of water. Lewis says: ""We know that if the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme operates to its full potential just once, it will have saved more carbon cost than was used to build the entire infrastructure. ""While we can never fully eradicate the threat of flooding from rivers or surface water run-off, we can be very proud of the steps we have taken over the past decade to protect our beautiful city, its businesses and its people as we move forward into an uncertain future for our climate."" Back in the Calder Valley, echoes of the floodwaters which hit on 26 December 2015 are still visible a decade on. On buildings, plaques on walls can be seen marking the levels which were reached by the water. Hidden in plain sight along almost every door and window are brackets to which floodgates can be attached the moment a flood alert escalates to an urgent warning. Some shops have signs which can transform into barriers, while others have valuable goods and electrics raised more than 3ft (1m) from the ground. What could be mistaken as decorative cladding in pubs like The Albert in Hebden Bridge can be turned into shelving strong enough to hold detachable table tops and chairs. Many stores have replaced carpets with hard materials such as wood or stone so mud and mess left behind by the water can be swilled away. As a direct result of the devastation in December 2015, the Slow the Flow charity was set up to prevent such a disaster from impacting towns again. The charity works with the National Trust at nearby Hardcastle Crags and focuses on Natural Flood Management (NFM). ""We have now built over 1,000 'leaky dams',"" Adrian explains. Such deliberately leaky dams are made by putting branches and twigs across small waterways in a bid to reduce flooding. At a flood summit held in West Yorkshire earlier this year, Floods Minister Emma Hardy told the BBC that Yorkshire was ""leading the way"" in NFM. ""This is a win for everyone because it is low-cost, because it involves volunteers, it is a win for nature and it is a win for flood protection. ""The answer is not always going to be nature and sometimes we have to raise river defences and put in big concrete defences, but NFM and Slow the Flow have a huge role to play.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyvm0rkk7no
2025-12-26,Can an old nuclear power plant have a green future?,science,BBC,"Seventy years ago work started on a project which profoundly changed the landscape of a part of southern Scotland. About 2,000 workers were drafted in as construction began in 1955 on the Chapelcross nuclear power station near Annan - the first in Scotland. It started generating electricity in 1959 and continued until 2004, with decommissioning work still ongoing on the site today. Now there are plans in place which could continue its role meeting the nation's energy needs - but from very different sources. Building the plant was a massive task with the concrete housing the four reactors up to eight feet (2.5m) thick. Its four cooling towers - which became a familiar landmark before being demolished in 2007 - stood 300ft (91m) high. The site was officially opened on 2 May 1959 and at its peak provided employment for hundreds of people. At full power it could generate enough electricity to meet the needs of every home in south west Scotland, the Borders and Cumbria. It also produced vital elements for use in atomic bombs. After it ceased operation there were some calls for a replacement nuclear plant to be built on the site but the Scottish government is opposed to constructing new ones. Instead, it is hoped the area can take advantage of its links to the national grid by becoming a green energy hub and ensure it remains a big employer in the area. One man who has seen more of its story than most is site director for Nuclear Restoration Services at Chapelcross, Richard Murray. He started out as an apprentice in 1987 and has spent a little over 30 years of his career in total at the Dumfries and Galloway plant. ""I'm an Annan person, born and bred,"" he said. ""I've had quite a number of aunts and uncles and cousins work on the site, so I've got quite a long family affinity to the site as well and obviously being brought up in Annan I knew a large number of people who worked here."" He said its importance for the local economy was hard to overstate. ""At its peak, it was well in excess of 700 people employed here,"" he said. ""It was a 24/7 operation, 365 days a year - parts of the town of Annan were built to accommodate the site in terms of housing workers from the area."" There are still about 200 people working during decommissioning so it remains an important employer but well short of the numbers it once had. He said the taking down of the cooling towers in 2007 was a big moment as many people from the area used to say that when you saw them you knew you were nearly home. ""From my own personal perspective, I could see them from my bedroom window when I was growing up as a child, so it was a real landmark for the area,"" he added. He hopes it can see worker numbers rise again in its new role looking at hydrogen, solar power, battery storage and developing renewables technology. Alongside it, of course, is the decommissioning process where Richard says they have ""decades of work ahead"". The latest estimate was another 70 years at least which will have to be carried out alongside any new developments. Richard said new nuclear plants were very different to Chapelcross and he believed it still had its part to play in meeting the nation's energy needs. The Scottish Greens, though, are happy to see it take on a different role. ""Turning the site into a green energy hub is a great opportunity,"" said the party's Laura Moodie. ""It means clean power, good jobs, and a real step towards tackling the climate crisis. ""Repurposing old sites for renewables, especially if done alongside training and supporting local workers, is exactly the kind of forward thinking Scotland needs."" The details of exactly what it means are still being fine-tuned. Graeme Anderson, the chief executive of CX Power, strategic developer of the green energy hub plans, said they were still at an ""early and exciting stage"". ""Our focus right now is on developing ideas, building strong relationships, and working closely with the local community and stakeholders to understand what matters most to them and where opportunities lie,"" he said. They hope that can deliver ""real, long-term benefits"" for the whole of the region on a site which pioneered nuclear power in Scotland.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq4xr0pj1jo

Hedgehogs rescued by the Prickles and Paws charity, in Cornwall, have been cared for in the back garden of founder Diane South. But a fundraiser, which has been match-funded, has meant a dedicated rescue centre on a plot of land at Carnanton, near Newquay, is being built. Charity co-founder and rescue director Katy South said: ""The new 'hogspital', which is in the final stages of construction, will substantially increase the charity's current capacity for hedgehog admissions and care."" Work is expected to be completed in January. Ms South said in 2023 they cared for ""a record 1,428 sick, injured, or orphaned hedgehogs, an impressive achievement given the charity's current residential location"".

2025-12-26,Farmer's fears over planned trail hunting ban,science,BBC,"As hunts are preparing for their traditional Boxing Day meets, a hunt master says plans to ban trail hunting will be ""catastrophic"" for the rural community. Fox hunting was banned 20 years ago, but Labour has further pledged to , where hounds follow a pre-laid scent in lieu of chasing a live animal. Critics argue the sport is being used as a for illegal hunting, claiming hounds invariably pursue the scent of live foxes, which ends in cruelty. But Hugo Mann, farmer and joint master of the Salisbury-based Wilton Hunt, said it is a social lifeline for the farming community ""in the darkest depths of winter"". Mr Mann, 36, estimates for a single day's hunting he speaks to 20 different farmers in order to plan a route across their land, and organises about 40 meets a year. ""A ban would be catastrophic for our rural community, we're the threads that run through the whole of our area,"" he said. ""It's a great point for rural people to meet each other in the darkest depths of winter, when they don't see many people. ""It's really just a real community we've created with hunting, like any sport, it just binds people together."" Mr Mann said it is rare for a huntsman to lose control of a pack, as the hounds are well disciplined and trained on recall. ""We are working with animals and occasionally things don't go as planned,"" he acknowledged. ""But we do everything we can to try and make it go smoothly."" He added that the prospect of a ban feels like another ""[The government] is already tearing us apart with this inheritance tax,"" he said. ""Farming is lonely enough as it is, and without this, I would just carry on at the farm. I wouldn't see anyone."" But Emma Judd, a representative of the League Against Cruel Sports, believes ""hunts very rarely lay an actual trail"". ""If it is laid, it is laid near where wildlife and other animals such as livestock are being kept,"" she said. ""So animals do get killed from trail hunting."" She said research by the organisation also revealed a majority of people supported a strengthened Hunting Act, amid the belief it is being used as a cover-up. ""That's across the board - whether they live in the rural areas or urban areas, and it's very similar across political splits,"" she said. The league believes the West of England has one of the highest rates of illegal fox hunting in the country based on footage gathered by hunt saboteurs. ""Fox hunts wreaking havoc on rural communities,"" Ms Judd said. ""These incidents included trespass in people's gardens, attacks on family pets and hounds running riot on roads."" Despite claims of widespread illegality, there have only been about 30 successful prosecutions of organised hunts under the Hunting Act, according to the British Hound Sport Association. New technology has also led to tighter scrutiny, as hunting saboteur groups can now monitor the hunts from drones overhead to ensure rules are being followed. The government has not given a time frame for the ban to come into effect, but said it is and will ""set out next steps in due course"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dylz375g8o
2025-12-26,California downpours ease but flood and mudslide risks linger,science,BBC,"Rainstorms are tapering off across southern California, but even modest additional rainfall could trigger floods and mudslides in saturated areas, forecasters warn. Officials say at least three people have died in the catastrophic flooding over the Christmas period. The storms - which continued into Friday - brought 6 inches (15 cm) of rainfall to Los Angeles County, with up to 18 inches recorded in the mountains, prompting evacuations and closing major roads. More than 50,000 people in the state are still without power as efforts to restore service continue on Friday. The US National Weather Service warned  on Friday  that ""the potential for flooding will be high"", though showers will taper off as the day goes on. ""Flood watches and advisories remain in effect as it won't take much additional rain to create flooding issues today, especially in the mountains where some areas have received close to 18 inches of rain since Tuesday,"" the NWS said in its latest forecast. The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers - invisible ribbons of water vapour that form over oceans and transport huge amounts of moisture, bringing intense rainfall and snow - during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues, including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rose. On Wednesday morning, a 64-year-old man from San Diego was killed by a fallen tree, the police department told US media. Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, the town's mayor told local news. And on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she ""was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean"" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, the sheriff's office said. In a statement on Thursday night, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said that a limited number of evacuation orders remained in effect.

Archaeologist Stephen Young says Mr Derby ""embodies the best of what it means to be a metal detectorist and an archaeological enthusiast"". Yet, for Mr Derby, from Kislingbury, near Northamptonshire, the greatest joy is finding ancient artefacts. ""You pick it up and think, 'What was the person like who owned it?'"" he says. His interest in metal detecting goes back to 1964, when he was helping his father in his garden. ""All of a sudden he bent down and picked something up - and it was a coin,"" recalls Mr Derby. Experts from Northampton Museum explained it dated to the reign of George III (1760 to 1820). ""And I was hooked on what they were showing me, so I decided I was going to get a metal detector."" Over the decades, he made many finds, but the one that first attracted international attention was the 1996 discovery at Whitehall Farm of a Roman villa estate. The extensive complex, dating to the early 3rd to late 4th Centuries, included two bath-houses, complete with tessellated mosaic floors, and two 2nd-Century round houses. ""I was detecting in a particular field and looking around, there was pottery lying around - then I started to find Roman coins,"" says Mr Derby. ""And the farmer had come along to see how I was doing and I said, 'You have a Roman site here.'"" They turned for advice to Mr Young, who had worked with Mr Derby since the mid-1980s. ""The site is a rare example of a late villa occupation remaining in use until the mid-5th Century, 50 years after the accepted termination of imperial Roman Britain,"" explains the former University of Northampton lecturer. The discovery at Nether Heyford, near Northampton, developed , attracting students, volunteers and archaeologists from around the world. Mr Derby's next massive discovery came when the same landowner offered him another field to survey. ""I went to this nice flat field and about 10 yards (9m) away from the hedge at the top, I got this fantastic signal,"" he says. ""And out came a lady's Saxon brooch, so I kept scratching around and I found a piece of metal which I thought could be part of a sword. ""I rang my son and said, 'You need to come – I've found a sword and there's a hand on the end of it!'"" By the time his son, Peter, turned up, the police had arrived to check the human remains were not the result of a recent murder. The discovery in 2003 became known as the Anglo-Saxon warrior. Further excavations in the area unearthed five more graves and then few years later, about 23 sets of remains were discovered. Among them were the remains of what invited to Britain by the Romans under treaty to provide military support, says Mr Young. The burials revealed family groupings, with some of women's remains found to be of local origin. Analysis suggested some possibly dated back to as far as 430AD - about the time the Roman empire was collapsing. This made it ""a seminal site of national importance for the post-Roman and early migration period of the 5th Century AD"", says Mr Young. Other finds included an early 6th-Century Mercian warrior burials and a 7th-Century mound burial of a man with a sword, whose rediscovery ""was down to Dave Derby"", he adds. ""I'm lucky to have worked with him and been able to integrate his talent and undoubted skills in enhancing our ability to understand the archaeological narrative,"" says Mr Young. Mr Derby continues to love metal detecting, now accompanied by Peter, who says: ""I feel like we're modern time travellers; we dig holes in the ground and uncover something that's not seen the light, sometimes for thousands of years."" are reported to Northamptonshire's finds liaison officer, in line with the law. One of Mr Derby's favourites is a 7th-Century gold and gemstone pendant, which was returned to the landowner and is now worn by his wife. ""I'd rather find artefacts - they belong to somebody and you think 'What were they doing there?'"" he says. ""It's one of the most fantastic hobbies I've ever had.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vm74gzn2ro

The animals were discovered by dog walkers on Margate Main Sands and at St Mildred's Bay Westgate in Kent, on Boxing Day. The Environment Agency (EA) said it was due to sea conditions and a strong wind on Christmas Eve which pulled the starfish off the chalk reef and on to the beach. An EA spokesperson said: ""Creatures like starfish, mussels, crabs and razor clams occupy rocky habitats. Unfortunately, they can be easily dislodged during unsettled weather, onshore winds or spring tides, causing them to be washed ashore. ""Specialist officers will monitor the wash-up at Margate.""

2025-12-26,Bronze Age treasure donated to village museum,science,BBC,"A village museum has expressed its delight at acquiring a hoard of Bronze Age items that have been declared treasure. The stash of copper-alloy debris, dating back more than 2,000 years, was found by metal detectorist David Stuckey, from Stevenage, in a field in Guilden Morden, Cambridgeshire, in December 2019. It was described by an expert as the equivalent of ""a modern-day recycling bin"". The hoard was declared treasure earlier this year and has now been donated to Ashwell Museum in Hertfordshire, where it will eventually go on display. Mr Stuckey, 69, had been detecting on the land ""About a foot down I suddenly saw fragments of green-coloured metal coming out of the hole. I picked up the pieces and could see that they were bronze fragments of 'something',"" he said. The 66 fragments date from the late Bronze Age — between 1050BC and 800BC - and include chapes, which are pieces of metal used to protect the sharp end of a bladed item such as a sword. Cambridgeshire County Council's finds liaison officer, Helen Fowler, said earlier this year that the hoard was most likely to have been deposited in one go to be melted down later, once there was enough metal to make the process worthwhile. ""The hoard is like our blue recycling bins here [in parts of Cambridgeshire],"" she said. Earlier this year it was declared treasure by a coroner under the stipulations of the It has now been donated to Ashwell Museum, just over the border in Hertfordshire,  by the landowner and Mr Stuckey. The museum's co-curator, Peter Greener, said: ""We're so pleased, as we don't have many Bronze Age items. ""It will be quite hard to display as it is bits of scrap, but we are planning a new display of local archaeology and finds from detectorists so it will go out, as it's interesting."" He said they would try to find out more about the hoard and it would be available for people to see and for researchers to use. Mr Greener also said the stash of debris might be named the ""Odsey Hoard"" at the request of the landowner. Mr Stuckey said he would ""look forward to visiting the museum sometime soon"" and seeing his finds on display.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q5xeyp0jo
2025-12-26,Endangered bird numbers boosted on Dartmoor,science,BBC,"Breeding numbers of a bird species which was ""close to disappearing"" in part of Devon have recovered, organisers of a project have said. The Duchy of Cornwall said the Dartmoor Curlew Recovery Programme had been running for five years at the national park in an attempt to boost The project aimed to increase the population of the bird, which has been classed as endangered by the RSPB and had one or two breeding pairs on Dartmoor for more than 20 years, the Duchy said. It added that through the project, the population in the park had risen to at least four pairs of curlews with 11 confirmed breeding territories, taking numbers to their highest level for about three decades. The project, funded by the Duchy and the King Charles III Charitable Fund, has been run in partnership with the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, Dartmoor National Park Authority, Natural England and the RSPB. Methods used in the project include headstarting - the collection of endangered bird eggs from the wild to be incubated in captivity until the chicks are strong enough to fly - and the restoration of moorland and meadow habitats. Matthew Morris, the Duchy's rural director, said the project had been a ""significant moment"" for the moor. ""Curlew were close to disappearing as a breeding bird from Dartmoor,"" he said. ""The progress made over these five years shows how nature can respond when the right conditions are restored and when land managers, farmers and conservation partners work together."" Jon Avon, curlew recovery project officer for the Duchy, said the recovery had been encouraging, but more work was needed. He said: ""While progress has been made, the recovery is still in its early stages, and the next phase will allow us to continue the practical work needed to support long-term breeding success across both curlew and other endangered bird species.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk5rnzw98o

They, along with a host of other animals, all featured in the news this year. To mark the end of 2025, we look back at their stories. Alaskan Malamutes typically grow to weigh between five or six stone (31-38kg) and have a special ""double coat"", which helps keep them warm in Arctic temperatures. But weighing in at a hefty 13 stone (82.5kg), Mal is more than twice the average size of a dog of his breed. Mal's owner, Amy Sharp, from Bourne, Lincolnshire, said she ""didn't really notice"" until he started to grow quickly out of harnesses and collars. ""He just got bigger and bigger,"" she said. ""I'm always being asked who's walking who?"" On a plus note, she added: ""He's a gentle giant. It's Mal's world and we're all just living in it."" Elsewhere, two donkeys from the same sanctuary in Lincolnshire have been recognised in the Derrick bagged the record for the world's tallest donkey - recorded at 5ft 5in (1.6m), while his pal, Bambou, took top spot in the longest ears on a living donkey category - 1ft 1in (33cm). Sanctuary owner Tracy Garton said: ""Derrick doesn't know he is big - he is very affectionate and loves to be with people."" As for Bambou, she added: ""He has got very, very long fluffy ears and they are the biggest in the world."" Ms Garton said she loved all the animals at the sanctuary, but said the recognition for Derrick and Bambou was a great talking point. Volunteer Bill Tembey said they would have a few contenders for a third record if the world's loudest donkey category was introduced - hee-haw! Back in September, more than 60 animals including dogs, hamsters and tortoises were blessed during a Vicar of Dibley-style pets' service at Salisbury Cathedral, giving thanks for their companionship. to take place at the cathedral, with the first held in September 2024. In addition to showing gratitude for the pets, there were readings, hymns and music from the girls' choir and junior choir. Animals kept outdoors, such as horses, were also welcomed to participate from outside. In South Yorkshire, pooches rescued from a house in Tickhill have been trained to catch criminals and relieve them of their ill-gotten gains. Dozens of springer spaniels were rescued by the RSPCA after they were found living in a filthy house in April. Since then, a ""select few"" have newly expanded dog unit, which has seen arrests go up by a third since 2024. The dogs are used by police to track and locate suspects, and to search for items such as drugs, cash and guns. Successes include a £10,000 stolen watch being located and a suspect who was trying to hide in a bin being apprehended. Among the more unusual stories featured in the news was that of an animal lover from Gloucestershire successfully hatching an emu egg after a late-night shopping spree. Rhi Evans, from Cirencester, Gloucestershire, has no memory of buying the egg, which was priced at £37, but woke one morning in 2022 to an email confirmation from eBay telling her it was on its way. Unable to secure a refund, Ms Evans decided to ""wing it"" and try and hatch it on her three-acre farm, despite warnings the birds were ""not pets for a casual keeper"". , which she named Jonathan before discovering it was female, lives with her at home. While Jonathan is an integral part of her life, Ms Evans said rearing an emu was not a decision to be taken lightly.

2025-12-25,East London church goes green with £170k upgrade,science,BBC,"An east London church has installed more than 100 solar panels and four heat pumps following a £170,000 investment in green technology. St Paul's West Hackney church now generates about 70% of its energy from 104 solar panels and four air source heat pumps. The project was funded by community group Stokey Energy, Hackney Council's Community Energy Fund and the London Olympics Legacy Fund. While exact savings are hard to calculate due to fluctuating energy prices, the parish initially estimated its £40,000 contribution could be recouped within four years. Father Brandon Fletcher-James, who became priest in the summer, told the : ""All churches aspire to be environmentally friendly, but we try to do it in a way that actually is practical. ""Even in the last five months of being here, I've been approached by various churches asking how it even came about in terms of solar panels, but also what that means for our environmental status."" Stokey Energy led the work, which it says has transformed the Anglican church into a ""solar powerhouse"". Co-founder Tom Campbell said the system now generates 46MWh of electricity a year and has slashed its energy costs. He said: ""Most churches have phenomenal thermal leaking, which is why they have so many problems with congregations really suffering from the cold, and enormous heating bills because the [buildings] are so poorly insulated."" Hackney Council hopes to replicate the scheme across other churches, temples and mosques, while also focusing on decarbonising its housing stock. Councillor Sarah Young, who leads on climate, environment and transport, said the council is installing solar panels on 27 blocks across three estates. The Labour-run authority says tenants and leaseholders ""could soon see their bills slashed"" as a result. The £2m scheme is being funded from the council's climate budget, which includes money from City Hall's Carbon Offset Fund. The council claims the project will pay for itself, with income from selling residents discounted solar electricity expected to cover costs over 10 to 20 years. On 18 December, St Paul's West Hackney received a visit from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. Parliamentary Under-Secretary Martin McCluskey praised the church as a flagship example of community-led energy. He said: ""It really stands as an example for what other buildings across the country can take advantage of with this new green technology that's readily available right now. ""The great thing about it is it's been led by the council and by community energy companies."" Father Fletcher-James said that his plans for making the church greener does not stop there. ""There is so much more we can do to be environmentally friendly in terms of our day-to-day running and costs, our admin, our governance.

2025-12-24,Conservationists work to save rare UK plant,science,BBC,"Conservationists in Somerset are attempting to save one of the UK's rarest plants from the brink of extinction. The starved wood-sedge (also known as Carex depauperate) is only found in two sites nationwide, one of which is in Axbridge in Somerset. It has been struggling to survive and so The Species Recovery Trust has moved some plants into captivity to ""bulk up"" its numbers in the hope of establishing two new populations within the Mendip Hills National Landscape. The starved wood-sedge is a perennial plant found typically found in wetland habitats such as bogs, fens, and swamps, but also moist woodland. The species is described as an important plant by The Species Recovery Trust for several reasons. It is a habitat for a variety of wetland species, including birds, insects, and amphibians, it helps to regulate water flow, and moves nutrients through the ecosystem. It has become threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation as wetland habitats are increasingly being drained or developed. Dominic Price, director of the trust, said: ""In the past few years the plants have unfortunately, and rather catastrophically, decided to move off the bankside habitat we have maintained for them and start growing directly on a public footpath. ""This has put them directly in harm's way from being trampled."" The conservation work is possible because of funding from the Mendip Hills National Landscape team. Manager Jim Hardcastle said: ""Nature recovery is key to our work these days so it's great that we can help the Species Recovery Trust in its important work. ""At first glance this is quite an unassuming grass that many people will have walked past for years but it's still an important part of the ecosystem and deserving of our attention and support.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25408ydngo
2025-12-26,Medieval loo and evidence of a murder among finds of 2025,science,BBC,"A medieval toilet, a ""murder"" victim and the remains of an extinct species of cattle are among the discoveries that have helped to shed light on the past this year. Archaeologists also uncovered one of the largest Iron Age hoards to date and part of a shipyard linked to Lord Nelson's fleet. Meanwhile, a growing number of amateur detectorists have been in the news, with one haul of Civil War coins fetching £63,000 at auction. Here, we take a look at some of the most interesting items making headlines in 2025, and hear from some of those with a passion for unearthing the past. Back in March, one of the ""largest and most important"" Iron Age finds in the UK was uncovered in North Yorkshire. was discovered in a field near Melsonby by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University. There were more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago. Historians believe the discovery could lead to a ""major re-evaluation"" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time. Other interesting finds include raised from the site of a 13th Century shipwreck off the Dorset coast, and a slipway from the 18th Century in the New Forest, where ships Researchers from the University of Southampton said the slipway at Buckler's Hard, a hamlet in the New Forest, was once home to one of the busiest private shipyards of the 1700s and would improve their understanding of shipbuilding techniques. Elsewhere, a medieval loo and a jet die used to predict the future were among the finds uncovered at Auckland Castle in Bishop Auckland, County Durham. At least three medieval toilets have been found over the years ""dotted around the site"", according to John Castling, the Auckland Project's archaeology curator. ""One is ironically very near to where the toilets are now for our visitors,"" he added. The latest loo, known as a garderobe, was discovered in June and is located next to the Great Hall, where bishops and their guests would have feasted. Experts said the finds, which also included a whale baleen and French jettons - coin-type objects used in calculations - would of everyday life at a medieval bishop's palace. show 1,446 discoveries in England in 2024 - up from 1,266 the previous year, with many of the finds uncovered by metal detectorists. Steve Hickman, who says he was inspired by the BBC comedy Detectorists, found near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, just two months after taking up the hobby. The haul fetched £63,000 at auction in Essex, with the proceeds being split with the owner of the farm. ""It's a ridiculous story. I was detecting in a field with power cables above when I got this really puzzling signal,"" he said. ""I looked up, thinking it was going to be those cables, but decided to dig because when you're starting out, you need to try everything to learn the good from the bad."" However, after not getting a signal, he filled the hole in, only to have second thoughts. He returned later that day and unearthed an orange pot containing no fewer than 1,064 silver coins dating back to the reign of Elizabeth I. In Dorset, TV personality Sandi Toksvig has been helping to unravel The presenter filmed with Bournemouth University researchers and students at an archaeological dig near Winterborne Kingston, where an Iron Age settlement and cemetery was excavated. During the episode of the Channel 4 show, called Hidden Wonders, researchers discovered the skeleton of a teenage girl buried face down in a pit, believed to have been murdered as a human sacrifice. Dr Miles Russell, the university's principal academic in prehistoric and Roman archaeology, worked with the former Great British Bake Off host during filming. ""The team were particularly shocked to hear that this could have been a human sacrifice, but it was obvious from Sandi's own interest in archaeology that she was deeply moved by what had been uncovered,"" he said. Archaeologists also uncovered what may be a significant historic burial site on the south coast of Cornwall. It followed the chance discovery of human teeth by a young boy near Lizard Point, who was holidaying with his family. Following the discovery, the police were initially called to investigate, but quickly determined the remains were historic. National Trust archaeologist Jim Parry said they had since uncovered multiple burials. Mr Parry said he believed the site to one of the area's many shipwrecks. ""It's exactly the kind of event that could explain a site like this,"" he said. ""But it's also possible the burials span centuries, with individuals added over time,"" he added. Meanwhile, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age coffin unearthed at a golf club will go on show at Lincoln Museum next year. The 10ft (3m) coffin, made from a hollowed-out oak tree, was unearthed by chance at a golf club in Tetney in 2018 during work on a pond. The 'Tetney Coffin' has undergone two years of conservation work carried out by York Archaeology with a £110,000 grant from Historic England. buried with a finely crafted axe, still with its wooden handle in place. An investigation of the plant and pollen remains found inside the coffin revealed that the man was laid on a bed of oak and yew branches and had a garland of flowers around his neck. Hazelnuts and other plants may have formed part of a food offering. Natalie Oliver, executive councillor for culture at Lincolnshire County Council, said the coffin was ""one of the most extraordinary objects - both in terms of its archaeological significance and its physical scale"". In August, remains of an extinct species of Bronze Age cattle were found in a cave in the Yorkshire Dales. Researchers worked with cave explorers to uncover while surveying caverns and sinkholes near Ingleborough. Aurochs, which are regarded as the wild ancestor of modern cattle, were once found across Europe before habitat loss and hunting wiped them out in the 17th Century. Rick Peterson, a caving archaeologist at the University of Central Lancashire, said: ""It's often experienced local cavers who are the first to encounter archaeological finds such as these as they are the only ones who can access the caves."" The team also found evidence of the area being used as a human burial site during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists from the University of York abandoned Norman castle site near Skipsea, East Yorkshire. Although little evidence of it remains today, recent research has revealed that the motte - or mound - previously thought to have been created by the Normans, actually dates from the Iron Age. Dr Elaine Jamieson, fieldwork project manager, said: ""I probably see it with completely different eyes to the tourists who are looking for a stone castle, but I see the castle in all the earthworks,"" she said. The castle would have likely originally have been built from timber, before being rebuilt in stone, she added. After the castle was abandoned, Dr Jamieson said it was possible local villagers took the stone to use elsewhere. Meanwhile, scientists at Liverpool John Moores University used computer technology to recreate the face of a woman from her 900-year-old skull. Skeletons from 14 bodies were found buried at Holy Trinity Kendal Parish Church in Kendal, Cumbria, when the Environment Agency (EA) started work on a flood management scheme in 2022. Stephen Dean, a senior archaeologist at the EA, told BBC Radio Cumbria the woman's bones suggested she led a hard life, working outdoors extensively, probably in the fields, and eating a poor diet. There were also indications she had been , and her position in the church yard suggested she was not of high status, he said.

""The water was above the mantlepiece - that amount of water lifted all of the furniture, everything had been floating."" Amelia, her husband and four-year-old son are in rented accommodation and this Christmas will be very different. ""We've just had to start again really,"" she said. The family do not know when they will be able to return home. She added: ""Because we don't have insurance it's down to us. ""Obviously there's things we can't do until it dries out fully, the kitchen we can't put anything in now because it's still wet - people with insurance have been told six months.""

""I think it would be really difficult to sell this house now - I don't think anyone's going to be looking to buy on Drybridge Street - but it would be nice to live a little higher,"" she said. But in Monmouth town centre things are improving. It will take months for some businesses to recover, and there are fears some will not survive. But retailers such as Jenny Chuter, who owns two businesses in the town, are keen to stress Monmouth ""is open for business"". Jenny's shops were under water after the flood and she lost £10,000 worth of stock. ""It's been very difficult, it's been very tricky, everyone's lost lots of stock, everyone's lost lots of work,"" she said. ""All the people have lost their homes and belongings - it's been devastating."" Jenny said she had worked around the clock to make sure she was open for the crucial Christmas period. ""Christmas is the busiest time for most businesses, retail or not, so it's come at a very difficult time - we're trying to tell people that there's lots still here in Monmouth, so please come and support us,"" she said. The unprecedented deluge on Monmouth saw the River Monnow reach record levels, exceeding those recorded during Storm Dennis in 2020 and Storm Bert in 2024. The river usually flows at a rate of six tonnes a second but, when the town flooded, that increased to nearly 400 tonnes a second. Monmouthshire council has introduced Welsh government-funded grants and free parking in the town to try and help businesses recover. Wendy Harris, 80, will not be able to return to her ground floor flat in the town until the new year. She lost her car in the flood and had to be rescued by firefighters. ""All my furniture has gone and my car has gone and I can't get back into my flat until probably the middle of February by the time it's all sorted,"" she said. Her flat was left with a thick layer of mud, and will take months to dry out. She is staying with her daughter over the Christmas holidays. ""The response by the people who weren't flooded has been amazing and the emergency services were just remarkable,"" she said. But like many people in the town, she is resolute and remains positive about the festive period and the future. ""Every time another shop opens I cry because it's just, yes, we're nearly there, and I just think it's fantastic,"" she said.

Libby Clarke also sells agricultural land and said farmers should ""continue to lobby"" for more change when it comes to taxing family farms. On Monday, the government announced Ms Clarke said the farming sector had been seen by the government ""as an easy target to try and get revenue in from"", which she branded as ""totally unfair"". President of the Ulster Farmers Union, William Irvine, but it was ""not where we want to see the final position to be"". The move was a ""step in the right direction,"" he said. Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir also welcomed the announcement saying it was ""significant and important"" but ""long overdue"". He said there had been ""a lot of anxiety and worry among the farming community in Northern Ireland"" since the inheritance tax proposal. , Ms Clarke said the ""stress that it has brought throughout farmers right across the country for over a year has been immense"". She said the tax threshold increase would still continue to affect farmers in Northern Ireland. ""Land can sell up to £35,000 an acre so you're not into a whole lot of acres before you're into that threshold [of £2.5m] because you also have to take into account your farm buildings, livestock, machinery,"" she said. ""£2.5m, although it sounds like a big headline figure is actually – in terms of a farm of 100 to 150 acres – it's not going to cut it.

Ms Armstrong said her husband passed away aged 58 from cancer in 2021, having spent his entire working life growing a dairy farm that he could leave to his loved ones. Following her husband's passing, Ms Armstrong said she was incredibly worried about how the proposed changes to inheritance tax would impact their family. Ms Armstrong described the government's new plans a huge relief for her family and for many other farming families across Northern Ireland. ""We were not expecting this news this side of Christmas. It was certainly something we were hoping for, but it came completely out of the blue,"" ""Now, as a family, this news takes us out of that inheritance tax liability, and we do fall within the £5m allowance, which is a huge weight off our shoulders. ""There are many ongoing concerns and worries within farming, and this is one that we didn't need. Thankfully, it has now been removed for us."" The removal of 100% inheritance tax relief for farmers placed many in Northern Ireland in an invidious position. Land values here are significantly higher than elsewhere in the UK, easily putting many over the threshold. And farms here are also predominantly owner-occupied - small family farms where the farmer often has a full-time job that essentially funds the farm work. Tenant farming on large estates is just not a cultural thing here. I have had farmers breaking down when they're talking to me about inheritance tax, telling of parents refusing cancer treatment, fears of saddling children with enormous debt, or the awful hope that an elderly parent will die before April to avoid a multi-million pound tax bill that was never factored into succession planning down the years. This new change to the threshold is a welcome relief for many, but uncertainty and fear will still remain for some. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Carla Lockhart said she was not surprised by the announcement as the government ""have come under serious pressure and it's absolutely clear there was a growing rebellion of labour MPs"" but it was ""welcome news"". ""It's not exactly what we want and we will continue press for more but it is welcome news at Christmas for our farmers,"" Lockhart told Good Morning Ulster. ""There are a number of farms still that are going to be hit and we've got to look at the impact in Northern Ireland and across the UK but this is a start."" Sinn Féin MP Cathal Mallaghan also welcomed the news and said he did not know what happened in terms of the government's change of policy. ""Perhaps it was a visit from the ghost of Christmas future that Rachel Reeves and the Treasury have seen how much damage that this is going to cause,"" he told the programme. Mallaghan said there was ""a lot of fear"" in the farming community with added pressure such as ""This was just putting so much pressure on family farms that I feel that this is such a great relief to them – especially before Christmas.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgd03wje72o

South West Water (SWW) said it had cleared more than from its wastewater network over the past year, removing 450 tonnes (70,863st) of waste in the process. It said about three-quarters of the issues were caused by fats, oils and grease being poured down sinks along with wet wipes being flushed down toilets. SWW said it was a ""peak period"" for fats, oil and grease entering the sewer network and asked people to dispose of them in a bin or food waste caddy after they had cooled down and hardened. Advice has also been issued by SWW about avoiding putting food scraps and coffee grounds down the sink, saying this can also contribute to blockages. Bosses at the water company added wet wipes - even those labelled as ""flushable"" - should be thrown in a bin rather than put down a toilet. Wet wipes, fats, oils and grease can clump together in sewers to cause ""fatbergs"", which lead to blockages. Mark Willis, customer service and network manager for wastewater services at SWW, said: ""Christmas is a time for enjoying festive meals and celebrating with family, but it's also a peak period for fats, oils and grease entering the sewer network. ""By following our simple festive tips at home, households can prevent blockages, protect the environment and help ensure a worry-free Christmas for everyone."" SWW added it would be working alongside environmental compliance experts ECAS to ensure businesses were disposing their fats, oils and grease safely during the festive period.

Whilst some authorities in the UK are able to recycle these tubs via kerbside collection, currently Hampshire cannot. Earning himself the nickname ""Sweet Tub Teddy"", he has doubled his goal for 2025 - and his mum Laura said their house was already filled with tubs from ""floor to ceiling"". Last Christmas, Teddy amassed 2,598 tubs in a month by collecting them from people's houses, taking them out of bins and asking locals to leave them on his doorstep. Originally part of Greene King's Tub2Pub charity appeal, some supermarkets have now also stepped in and opened collection points for Teddy. ""Five thousand is my mission this year and I've already started collecting,"" he said. His mum Laura added they were being stored in their loft, their spare room and the boot of her car.

2025-12-25,Indonesians raise white flags as anger grows over slow flood aid,science,BBC,"For weeks now, angry and distressed residents in Indonesia's westernmost province have been raising white flags over the state's slow response to a series of deadly floods. , the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. ""Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,"" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is ""under control"". ""Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,"" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts. Prabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over . In August and September, thousands of Indonesians over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%. Last Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: ""I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world."" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. ""The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,"" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, told the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. ""How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,"" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring that he welcomes help ""from anyone, anywhere"". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a ""national scale"", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts. For some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. , was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. ""Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,"" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents ""fight like zombies"" for every bit of supply delivered to her village ""because we are starving"", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as ""guidance"" from the central government. The president's refusal to accept international aid is his way of asserting authority, said Vidhyandika Djati Perkasa, a senior politics researcher at Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. ""Opening the door to foreign assistance means inviting foreign scrutiny, which they do not want... [Prabowo] doesn't want to be seen as a failure and is trying to ,"" Mr Perkasa said, noting however that this could backfire politically. Prabowo has prioritised the ""symbolic performance of sovereignty"" over crisis management, said Vedi Hadiz, an Asian studies professor at the University of Melbourne. Critics say the government has little understanding of the situation on the ground. Some also accuse Prabowo of being insensitive toward flood victims by promoting the expansion of palm oil plantations - environmental groups say the deforestation caused by that has also worsened the floods. Rindu Majalina said she initially thought herself fortunate to have survived the floods, ""but it turns out the post-disaster situation is even worse"". ""It has been very painful and miserable,"" she said. ""Everything has come to a complete standstill, from markets to schools to offices. My children don't know if they'll ever be able to go back to school.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzwqjpzp4o

She is part of WAY Changemakers, a group which recently compiled a featuring the views of 88 young people.

""Buying organic food, going vegan, getting solar panels or an electric car - that is all really expensive. It is a little weird something meant to be the better option is so expensive."" One green step which could be taken is to reduce the costs of buses, the Changemakers said. Ms Cheesley, who travelled between Highworth and Swindon for school, said: ""The dayrider bus tickets have gone from £2 to about £3.80.

Emma Bushell, deputy leader of Swindon Borough Council, met with the WAY Changemakers to discuss how their ideas linked up with the which aims to reduce the town's carbon footprint.

The University of Exeter said scientists observed fiddler crabs in a polluted mangrove forest in Colombia ingest ""large quantities of small plastic particles in the sediment"". It said the species could break down plastics within days - but scientists warned of a potential release of harmful nanoplastics into their tissues and, consequently, the food chain. Tamara Galloway, professor of ecotoxicology in the Department of Biosciences in Penryn, said: ""Until now, we did not know whether they avoided plastic in the natural environment or would adapt to its presence."" The university said the research was led by Professor José M. Riascos, with other institutions including Universidad de Antioquia in Turbo and Medellin, the University of Exeter, and the Corporation Center of Excellence in Marine Sciences (CEMarin) in Bogotá. It said the Gulf of Urabá, where the study took place, had some of the highest levels of plastic contamination reported anywhere in the world. ""Despite this, fiddler crab populations are thriving in the area, raising the question of how these creatures tolerate such high levels of plastic waste,"" it said. It said researches sampled a total of 95 crabs. Daniela Díaz, of the Universidad de Antioquia, said it showed living creatures were finding ways to cope with pressures.

John Charlesworth, 78, who went by his middle name Philip, was found dead by his son at their farm in Silkstone, Barnsley, on October 29 last year. An inquest at Sheffield Coroner's Court heard he had been ""growing more and more anxious about inheritance tax and the implications for the farm"". His son Jonathan Charlesworth, reacting to the government's plan to raise the inheritance tax relief threshold from £1m to £2.5m, said that ""pressure from the industry has paid off"". The change to the reforms comes after ministers ""listened to concerns"" of the farming community and businesses, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. Jonathan Charlesworth told the inquest into his father's death that he believed he had wanted to ""beat"" the government's proposals and ""save the farm for future generations"". Under Labour's initial proposal, the full 100% relief was to be restricted to the first £1m of property. Jonathan Charlesworth said: ""I think he was under stress looking after my mum but if it hadn't been for worries about inheritance tax he would still be here today. He wouldn't have put us all through that for any other reason. ""I think he woke up that morning and thought, 'I'm not risking it, I'm not risking losing everything I've worked for'."" He added: ""In the couple of months before it happened, the only thing he talked about was inheritance tax. ""I think he just wasn't going to let the government beat him. That was his final hurrah."" He said the government's change of plan was a ""step in the right direction - more farms will sleep better this Christmas without the threat of inheritance tax looming over them"". ""There will, however, be plenty of larger family farms that will have to plan for potential inheritance tax costs and a further window for them to do this would be beneficial. ""It's a welcome U-turn that won't bring back the lives lost over the last year or so due to the anxiety caused, but will hopefully prevent a flood of suicides running up to the commencement in April. ""Pressure from the industry has paid off - this will be the best Christmas present for a lot of farmers."" Jonathan Charlesworth said the change ""should have been researched and put out to review before any announcement was made"". ""But today we can celebrate a well fought-for victory for our precious countryside and the custodians of it,"" he added. The original Treasury plans to raise money as farmers pass their businesses from generation to generation triggered protests with tractors outside Parliament and criticism from some Labour MPs in rural seats. The higher threshold, which will take effect in April, will allow spouses or civil partners to pass on up to £5m in qualifying agricultural or business assets between them before paying inheritance tax - on top of existing allowances, Defra said. Above that allowance, farmers will get 50% relief on qualifying assets and will pay a reduced effective rate of up to 20%, rather than the standard 40%. The number of estates facing higher inheritance tax will be reduced from about 2,000 under the original plans to up to 1,100, hitting only the largest farms, according to the government. Farmers currently do not pay inheritance tax on agricultural and business assets which they pass on.

The dogs stick to their usual routine, but are also fed a special festive feast of turkey and pigs-in-blankets. The facility near Glencaple has helped find homes for more than 5,000 dogs since it opened in 2003. Staff work round-the-clock to keep the kennels running smoothly, with dogs being walked, given enrichment activities and treats. Kennel manager Rebecca Plenderleith said: ""Christmas Day follows the usual routine for the dogs, as changes can be unsettling. ""For staff it's a day filled with Christmas music and silly hats, we make sure everyone is enjoying it."" Rebecca said her Christmas wish would be to find a forever home for Molly, a nine-year-old terrier cross. ""She came to us after her owner sadly passed away,"" she added.

""But if you do choose to adopt, we would love for you to put an application in for one of our dogs."" She said some people still do not realise the commitment that comes with having a dog as a pet. ""It's a very cute idea to give a dog as a present for Christmas,"" Rebecca said. ""But we have to remember that you are taking a life into your home and there's a lot of care that goes into giving them everything they need."" The centre is a charity which is reliant on local support to keep their shelves stocked with food and treats for the dogs.

2025-12-22,India's jobs guarantee scheme: A global model under threat?,science,BBC,"India is home to one of the world's most ambitious social programmes - a jobs guarantee that gives every rural household the legal right to paid work. Launched in 2005 by a Congress party government, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) entitled every rural household to demand up to 100 days of paid manual work each year at a statutory minimum wage. This mattered in a country where 65% of 1.4 billion people live in rural areas and nearly half rely on farming, which generates insufficient income, accounting for just 16% of India's GDP. Providing unskilled public work across all but fully urban districts, the scheme has become a backbone of rural livelihoods, cushioning demand during economic shocks. It is also among the world's most studied anti-poverty programmes, with strong equity: over half of the estimated 126 million scheme workers are women, and around 40% come from ""scheduled castes"" or tribes, among the most deprived Indians The ruling Narendra Modi government, initially critical and later inclined to pare it back, turned to the scheme in crises -  most notably during the Covid pandemic, when mass return migration from cities to villages sharply drove up demand for work. Economists say the scheme lifted rural consumption, reduced poverty, improved school attendance, and in some regions pushed up private-sector wages. Last week, the government introduced a that repeals and rebrands the scheme. The programme - renamed MGNREGA in 2009 to honour Mahatma Gandhi - has now dropped his name altogether. While the renaming drew the political heat, the more consequential changes lie in what the new law - known as G RAM G for short - actually does. It raises the annual employment guarantee from 100 to 125 days per rural household. It retains the provision that workers not given jobs within 15 days are entitled to an unemployment allowance. Under the original scheme, the federal government paid all labour wages and most material costs - roughly a 90:10 split with the states. Funding will now follow a 60:40 split between the federal government and most states. That could push states' contribution to 40% or more of total project cost. The federal government keeps control, including the power to notify the scheme and decide state-wise allocations. States remain legally responsible for providing employment - or paying unemployment allowances, even as the central government allocates $9.5bn for the scheme in the current financial year, ending next March. The government frames the reforms as a modernised, more effective, and corruption-free programme aimed at empowering the poor. ""This law stands firmly in favour of the poor, in support of progress, and in complete guarantee of employment for the workers,"" says federal agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Critics - including opposition parties, academics, and some state governments - warn that capping funds and shifting costs to states could dilute a rare legal right in India's welfare system. ""It is the culmination of the long-standing drive for centralisation of the scheme under the Modi government. But it is more than centralisation. It is the reduction of employment guarantee to a discretionary scheme. A clause allows the federal government to decide where and when the scheme applies,"" Jean Dreze, a development economist, told me. Prof Dreze says the increase to 125 guaranteed workdays per household may sound like a major revamp, but is a ""red herring"". A recent by LibTech India, an advocacy group, found that only 7% of rural households working on the scheme received the 100 days of work in 2023-24. ""When the ceiling is not binding, how does it help to raise it? Raising wage rates, again, is a much better way of expanding benefits. Second, raising the ceiling is a cosmetic measure when financial restrictions pull the other way, "" Prof Dreze These and other concerns appear to have prompted a group of international scholars to petition the Modi government in defence of the original scheme, warning that the new funding model could undermine its purpose. ""The [scheme] has captured the world's attention with its demonstrated achievements and innovative design. To dismantle it now would be a historic error,""  an , led by Olivier De Schutter, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, warned. To be sure, the scheme has faced persistent challenges, including underfunding and delays in wage payments. West Bengal's programme, for example, has faced deep cuts and funding freezes since 2022, with the federal government halting funds over alleged non-compliance. Yet despite these challenges, the scheme appears to have delivered measurable impact. by economists Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehaus, and Sandip Sukhtankar found that the broader, economy-wide impacts of the scheme boosted beneficiary households' earnings by 14% and cut poverty by 26%. Workers demanded higher wages, land returns fell, and job gains were larger in villages, the study found. But many say the scheme's durability also underscores a deeper structural problem: India's chronic inability to generate enough non-farm jobs to absorb surplus rural labour. Agriculture has consistently lagged behind the broader economy, growing just 3% annually since 2001–02, compared with 7% for the rest of the economy. Critics such as Nitin Pai of the Takshashila Institution, a think-tank, argue that the scheme cushions distress but does little to raise long-term rural productivity, and may even blunt incentives for agricultural reform. ""With [the scheme] we're merely treating a serious underlying malaise with steroids,"" said Mr Pai in a post on X. The government's Economic Survey 2023–24 questions whether demand under the scheme truly mirrors rural hardship. If that was the case, data should show higher fund use and employment in poorer states with higher unemployment, the survey says. Yet, it notes, Tamil Nadu, with under 1% of the country's poor, received nearly 15% of the scheme's funds, while Kerala, with just 0.1% of the poor, accounted for almost 4% of federal allocations. The survey adds that the actual work generated depends largely on a state's administrative capacity: states with trained staff can process requests on time, directly influencing how much employment is provided. Despite these anomalies, the case for the scheme remains strong in a country where many depend on low-income rural work and where the deeper challenge is the lack of quality employment. Even headline figures on rising labour participation in India can be misleading: more people ""working"" does not always mean better or more productive jobs. A recent paper by economists Maitreesh Ghatak, Mrinalini Jha and Jitendra Singh finds that the country's recent rise in labour force participation, especially among women, reflects economic distress rather than growth-driven job creation. The authors say the increase is concentrated in the most vulnerable forms of work: unpaid family helpers and self-employed workers, who have very low productivity and falling real earnings. ""The recent expansion in employment reflects economic distress leading to subsistence work, rather than growth-driven better quality job creation,"" they say. The evidence suggests people are driven into subsistence work by necessity, not drawn into better-quality jobs by a stronger economy. This ensures that the world's largest jobs guarantee scheme will remain central to the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Indians - whether the revamped version will strengthen it or undermine its impact remains to be seen.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lr980vvjpo
2025-12-24,"County farm estate brings in £734,000",science,BBC,"A local authority says its county farms estate has brought in a net profit of £734,000 over the past year. There are 63 tenant farms owned by Staffordshire County Council, covering about 6,500 acres. They provide opportunities for new and progressing farmers as well as generating income for public services, the authority's bosses said. Alongside the financial return, the estate has supported local food production as well as rural businesses and jobs. The five new tenants have taken up holdings on the estate this year, while two existing tenants progressed to larger farms. Edward Johnson, from Stone, grew up on a county farm where his father Philip is a dairy tenant and is now a tenant farmer himself. He secured a starter dairy holding in June, and said he had a ""huge passion"" for the industry, which ""isn't easy to get started in"". ""Gaining this tenancy has meant I can start farming in my own right,"" he added. Luke Greenfield and his partner Delyth are also among the new tenant farmers on the county's roster. ""We started farming at a smallholding in Cheshire and moved on to our council holding earlier this year,"" Mr Greenfield said. The pair have 130 cows and 80 sheep and said they were looking forward to seeing how their ""farming journey"" progressed. The council has been renting out farms since 1908, with a focus on livestock and dairy farming. Martin Murray, acting leader of the authority, said buying a farm outright was out of reach for most, which was why the tenancies were so important. ""Our tenants represent the future of farming in Staffordshire, and county farms help lay the foundations for the next generation,"" he said. More county farms were expected to become available to let next year, the authority said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4qk44545do

British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) made an assessment on Friday before carrying out a rescue operation on Saturday, with help from a fish farm firm. Tom Hadley, of BDMLR, said the seal pup was ""cross"" but later appeared to be relieved to be freed. He said the animal was in a ""really tricky spot"". that it was also ""bitey end up"". ""They have got a pretty serious bite,"" he said. ""What we had to do was put someone in the hole with it, but just out of reach, and distract it with a person waving a towel which meant it could be restrained and we could get it out."" Local firm Cooke Aquaculture assisted by lifting away a rock. Mr Hadley said: ""It was pretty cross with us. They don't know we're trying to help, they just see someone trying to attack them.""

2025-12-23,NI farm families 'in a better place' after inheritance tax plan climbdown,science,BBC,"Farmers in Northern Ireland ""never gave up hope"" that the government would move on its proposals around inheritance tax. William Irvine, the president of the Ulster Farmers Union, has welcomed a move by the government to At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026, ending the 100% tax relief that had been in place since the 1980s. Mr Irvine said the news ""eases pressure on family farms"" but he said that ""it is not where we want to see the final position to be"". Mr Irvine told BBC News NI that ""farm families are in a better place today than they were this time yesterday as a result of this announcement"". He said that whilst there had not been ""time to crunch the numbers yet"", he estimated that ""between 80 and 90% of Northern Ireland farms should be significantly, if not totally, covered"" by the new threshold. The move is a ""step in the right direction,"" he said. It ""gives people the confidence to invest in their farms for the future"" and ""gives younger generations the confidence to enter the industry,"" he added. Whilst £5m is a lot of money, Mr Irvine told BBC News NI that in farming terms, it is a ""very average farm"" and that there are many farm families with £5m holdings ""struggling to get living wage out of it"". He said ""the old adage of asset rich and cash poor absolutely applies to farming"" as land, stock and farming kit is extremely valuable. Speaking on Evening Extra on Radio Ulster, Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir welcomed the announcement saying that it is ""significant and important"" but was ""long overdue"". The minister commended the UFU on their ""respectful, sustained and successful engagement with the UK government"". He said that there had been ""a lot of anxiety and worry amongst the farming community in Northern Ireland"" since the inheritance tax proposal. He said his department found that the original proposal would have had ""a disproportionate and detrimental impact on Northern Ireland"" because of the family farms here. Muir added that he was conscious that the move would not apply to everyone in NI and that this ""announcement won't resolve everything"" but it is a ""welcome achievement"". Muir said it is really important that the government reflects on what has happened. H said he was concerned by the government's ""lack of empathy"" and ""lack of listening"" but that it is ""good that they've done this now"". ""Lets learn lessons"" and ""ensure this never occurs again,"" he continued. But he hopes that today will provide some reassurance. ""It's taken so long for them to realise the impact of this and to roll back. ""I think the UK government need to come clean in terms of recognising the mistake that they've made in this. ""Politics sometimes is about saying look we got this wrong and we are going to fix it,"" he said. Muir said he thinks the government should acknowledge that this situation should have never occurred. But that ""this move allows us to protect the family farms"". Mr Irvine said the last 14 months had been very stressful and ""could absolutely have been avoided"" if the government had listened and talked to the agricultural industry at an earlier stage. Going forward, Mr Irvine said he would like to see ""a sensible discussion"" about how inheritance tax should be handled long term. The Chair of Stormont's Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs committee Robbie Butler welcomed the climb down but said it needs to be ""removed totally"". ""This has been a long held, deep-seeded concern which was really impacting the mental health of farm families right across Northern Ireland,"" he said. Colin Smith, chief executive of The Livestock and Meat Commission, said the announcement was a ""positive step which will reduce the burden on farm families"". ""The anguish that this policy has created within the farming community has been widely publicised,"" he added. ""Family farms are the part of the fabric of NI, making significant contributions to the economy, environment and society. It is imperative that they are safeguarded and allowed to prosper for generations to come.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk57q8e4xo

The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year follow the long-term December average. As a result, the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, but it is the most likely outcome.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxvjq8xl0o

2025-12-22,Hunting for new deep-sea creatures at the edge of the world,science,BBC,"As Dr Michelle Taylor took a moment to breathe in the icy Antarctic air, a stark realisation sunk in. The nearest humans, aside from her immediate colleagues, were hundreds of miles away on the International Space Station. The researcher and her team were on a quest to find undiscovered marine life in one of the most remote places on the planet. What was it like hunting in the deep sea for the unknown? University of Essex academic Dr Taylor was in the south Chilean city of Punta Arenas earlier this year when she received a text. It was sent by a woman she had met in a pub a few days before, who said she was looking to find an elusive colossal squid. This woman, Kat Bolstad, had seen a video shared by Dr Taylor's team of researchers from their deep sea expedition, which was blowing up on social media. ""Michelle, people keep tagging me in this video,"" she wrote. ""I've taken as good a look as I can and I'm 80% sure you've filmed a colossal squid."" Not many people outside of scientific circles were aware of Ocean Census's 35-day quest when the R/V Falkor set off from Chile in March. But Dr Taylor knew filming this squid, so rare that it still straddles the line between legend and reality today, was about to propel her work to the world. . A colossal squid had not been seen for 100 years, let alone caught on camera. ""We were just in awe, we couldn't believe it. This is a world exclusive,"" Dr Taylor, who is the head of science at Ocean Census, said. ""I sent [Kat] the video and she consulted with a few other experts, and they came back and said 'yeah, pretty sure this is the first ever video footage of the colossal squid'."" The 30cm-long (11.8in) juvenile was spotted at a depth of 600m (1,968ft), near the South Sandwich Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean. Experts believe colossal squid can grow up to 7m (23ft) in length and weigh up to 500kg (1,100lb) - making them the heaviest invertebrate on the planet. Dr Taylor, who is based in Colchester, said: ""We think we caught the juvenile by surprise. It was transfixed. ""It just stayed still and hoped we would go away, which we did. That's how we came to find the unexpected."" The footage was captured via The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census and Schimdt Ocean Institute livestreaming its deep-sea dives, undertaken by a remotely operated vessel. However, it was initially missed by coral expert Dr Taylor and her team who thought it was a more common glass squid. Enthusiasts watching the livestream at home were instead the ones who realised how significant the find was, and they shared the footage on social media. ""The Schmidt Ocean Institute decided very early on they wanted the world to see what they were finding on their expedition,"" Dr Taylor said. ""They beam the video footage live from the deep sea. That was something extremely special about this whole experience. ""I've been to sea on eight, nine expeditions - ten maybe - and this is the first time my family has been able to watch exactly what I'm doing, live on YouTube."" Dr Taylor recalled even her neighbour was texting her in amazement at some of the finds the livestream was picking up. ""That's just the joy of this, right?,"" she said. ""I can make some predictions about what we'll find. But not this, this is extraordinary."" Other landmark finds included zombie worms, a hydrothermal vent, dragonfish, breeding urchins and 2.2 miles (3.5km) deep in a trench. At one point the scientists had to take refuge near an active volcano after a huge storm closed in. Dr Taylor was asked to lead the odyssey not long after being invited to a New Zealand-based Ocean Census workshop in 2023. It took her team eight days to sail to the remote area they were examining - and the same time to return. ""It's one of the most isolated places on the planet,"" she said. ""There were points when we were there and there were no other ships around that the closest people to us were on the International Space Station. ""It's a really unusual feeling,"" she added. Dr Taylor hopes the volume of biological discoveries her researchers made will inspire others to explore the world's most untapped corners. They collected almost 2,000 specimens across 14 animal groups, alongside thousands of high-definition images and hours of video. ""It gives me hope because we came across relatively unimpacted ecosystems, and there are some of them still out there,"" Dr Taylor added. ""Climate change is impacting every single inch of our ocean, so it was magical to be in an area that has little human impact.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7krrg3r1do

The incident happened at Peak Wildlife Park in Leek on Tuesday with staff at the park claiming they witnessed two powered paragliders heading directly towards the enclosure, which contained two males, Nanook and Nori. It caused keepers to rush towards the compound armed with non-lethal firearms in case the worst happened, which park director James Butler said had looked ""almost certain"". But both gliders managed to divert their landing just to the right side of the bears' border. Recalling the event, Mr Butler said: ""The animal keepers noticed the motorised paragliders and initially assumed they were going to land in one of the fields behind the park. ""After a few minutes, it became clear they were descending lower and lower, and at that point a radio call was made. ""They then cut their engines and appeared almost certain to land in the field containing the bears. ""At the last moment, however, they diverted their course, presumably after spotting the two very large polar bears directly beneath them.""

2025-12-22,Part of Edinburgh's Radical Road to reopen within months,science,BBC,"A section of historic path where the founding father of geology arrived at his theory of how and when the world was formed is to reopen in the summer. Edinburgh's 200-year-old Radical Road, which is set high along cliffs at Arthur's Seat, was closed in 2018 over rockfall concerns. Historic Environment Scotland, which manages the site, plan to have the section where Hutton's Rock stands open in time for the 300th anniversary of James Hutton's birth on 3 June. The path overlooks the parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse where senior royals stay when they visit the Scottish capital. Near the south end of the path is Hutton's Section, the spot where geologist James Hutton found proof in the late 18th Century for his theory that the world's landscape had evolved over time. The layers of rock at Salisbury Crags supported his belief that igneous rocks are formed from magma. His work is responsible for one of the fundamental principles of geology, and discovered that the Earth was significantly older than had previously been believed. Applications for scheduled monument consent and planning permission have been submitted for part of the path from the Hawse to the northern end of the South Quarry. Temporary barriers, which were erected when the path was closed, need to be relocated as well as interpretation and safety signage and vegetation management has to be carried out before it can reopen. The path got its name from the unemployed west of Scotland weavers who were set to work paving a track round Salisbury Crags - a plan suggested by author Sir Walter Scott in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820. Also known as the Scottish Insurrection, this uprising was the result of social unrest among workers who were fed up with what they perceived to be unjust working and living conditions. An HES spokeswoman told BBC Scotland News that inspection and descaling works, vital rock trajectory modelling and analysis, and necessary ecological surveys and ecological impact assessments had been carried out at the site. ""It remains our commitment to partially reopen the Radical Road, from the Hawse to the northern end of the South Quarry, once it is safe to do so next year to allow visitors to access both Hutton's Section and Hutton's Rock during the 300th anniversary of James Hutton's birth in June 2026.

The spokesperson said: ""Whilst we cannot say for certain all of these seals were brought in due to the storms - the upsurge in numbers that we see suggests it to be the case. ""These are the times where they are most likely to find themselves separated from their mothers, colliding with rocks, or washed up exhausted after struggling with the increased wind strengths and resultant changes in sea patterns."" BDMLR said it responded to multiple reports of seals needing assistance in recent weeks. It said Nirvana was found ""underweight, exhausted and surrounded by debris with nowhere safe to rest"". The charity said its approach was to reduce disturbance and monitor pups until they were united with their mothers but animals that were unwell, with no signs of their mother, were rescued for veterinary care and rehabilitation.

2025-12-19,'Not enough hydrogen' for region's hydrogen buses,science,BBC,"A fleet of 20 hydrogen-fuelled buses - half of which have never been used -  will be converted to battery power after the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA) said there was not enough hydrogen to run them. Ten of the buses operated by Arriva have been used sporadically since 2023, but only 450 passenger-carrying journeys have been made. Rival operator Stagecoach's 10 buses have never carried passengers though. The conversion to battery power is part of a multi-million pound investment in the region's buses. While the LCRCA said it would come at no extra cost to the taxpayer, one member of the transport committee said the whole project had been ""a waste of time and money"". The combined authority said the decision followed ""a thorough review of the hydrogen bus project including global hydrogen supply and pricing."" A spokesperson said the cost of the conversion would be met by the vehicles' supplier. The 20-strong fleet was purchased through the Liverpool City Region's Transforming Cities Fund in 2021. The buses were intended to serve the region's busiest route – the 10A between St Helens and Liverpool city centre. The fleet was launched to huge fanfare and described as a ""trailblazing"" way to help the region meet its net zero targets. LCRCA transport committee member and Liberal Democrat councillor Liz Makinson said ending the hydrogen project was ""the right decision"" but added: ""It's a pity that we spent £10m on the wrong decision."" She said: ""Similar electric buses would have been approximately £100,000 less per bus to buy in the first place. ""And basically these hydrogen buses have just been sitting there in a yard outside Sheffield, absolutely no use to anyone - 10 of them have never been on the road. ""So I think this is probably the right decision now, but it's a pity that we didn't get the decision to start with."" Makinson suggested the buses were acquired ""on a whim"". She said: ""The monorail salesman's been round, 'Let's have these hydrogen buses!' ""And the reality of it is that there are failed experiments in these buses in Aberdeen, further afield in the Netherlands and Germany. ""So really, some of this intelligence should have been listened to and thought through at the time, rather than just go ahead with this big, splashy fanfare."" Makinson said she believed there should be more scrutiny of ""big ticket decisions"" in the city region. A spokesperson for the LCRCA said: ""Following a thorough review of the Liverpool City Region's hydrogen bus pilot the decision has been taken to convert the region's 20 hydrogen buses to battery electric. ""The costs for this conversion will be met by the vehicle supplier as part of their ongoing commitment to support the introduction of an electrical bus fleet in the City Region. ""Once these works are complete the vehicles will join the hundreds of others entering service as part of the region's move towards a franchised network. ""Our commitment to decarbonising the region's bus network by 2035 remains. Earlier this year, we announced the purchase of over 100 new fully electric buses and, once repowered, these vehicles will join this fleet.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36z2386lw3o
2025-12-20,Engineer becomes first wheelchair user to go to space,science,BBC,"An engineer from Germany has become the world's first wheelchair user to go into space. Michaela Benthaus, who suffered a spinal cord injury in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, had reached out to a retired space engineer online to see if her dream of being an astronaut was still possible. He then helped organise the historic 10-minute flight with Blue Origin, the space tourism company founded by Jeff Bezos. Ms Benthaus and five others blasted off from Texas on Saturday and reached a point just above the so-called ""boundary"" of space, known as the Kármán line. ""It was the coolest experience!"" she said after landing in a video shared by Blue Origin. ""I didn't only like the view and the micro-gravity, but I also liked going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up."" New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle, took off from the company's Texas launch pad at 14:15 GMT. Ms Benthaus, who works at the European Space Agency, said she had ""really, really figured out how inaccessible our world still is"" for people with disabilities following her accident. She made her own way from her wheelchair into the capsule, using a bench extending from the hatch. Hans Koenigsmann, the retired SpaceX manager who helped organise the trip, was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed. ""I met Hans the first time online,"" Ms Benthaus said. ""I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?"" Koenigsmann said Ms Benthaus ""basically inspired me to do this. ""It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time,"" he said. Blue Origin said ground support equipment was added to help Ms Benthaus enter and exit the capsule. ""Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream,"" Phil Joyce, senior vice-president of New Shepard, said. The cost of the mission, which is the 16th suborbital space tourism launch carried out by Blue Origin, has not been revealed. The company has taken dozens of tourists to space. In April, pop star Katy Perry, Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King were for a flight that lasted about 11 minutes. The high-profile flights come at a time when private space companies are fiercely competing for dominance in space tourism.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9z0g7lleo
2025-12-21,More remains uncovered at medieval 'execution' site,science,BBC,"More than 70 bodies have now been uncovered at a medieval cemetery used for executed criminals, archaeologists say. The remains of about 40 men and boys, dating back to at least the 13th Century, were first discovered at West End Farm, on Brackley Road in Buckingham in 2018. when work was being carried out ahead of a development. Peter Strachan, councillor for planning and regeneration at Buckinghamshire Council, said that the ""discovery of what is likely a medieval execution burial ground offers a rare glimpse"" into the county's past. Buckinghamshire Council said the latest report confirmed that at least 73 individual bodies have been found across 34 graves. No clear order or layout has been discovered with most burials laid in a traditional east-west position. Twenty-six skeletons were found with their hands tied behind their backs. The burials were predominantly of adult males, with some juveniles and adolescents, but no females were identified. Further analysis revealed signs of childhood stress, healed fractures, and diseases such as tuberculosis. Only a small number of artefacts were found at the site, suggesting valuables were removed before burial. Two buckles were recovered, one dating to the late Roman period and one dating to the post-medieval period. Carbon dating of one skeleton provided a date in the late 13th Century, according to Buckinghamshire Council's archaeology team. It said that the unusual layout, lack of grave goods, and evidence of bound hands strongly suggested the site was an execution cemetery - a rare type of burial ground historically used for criminals. These sites, often located on parish boundaries, represent a marginalised sector of medieval society. Post-excavation analysis will now be undertaken and the results published to ensure a proper record of the discovery is made. Further research will continue to enhance understanding of the site, the individuals buried there, and life in Buckinghamshire during the Saxon and medieval periods.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvwk8xdrdo
2025-12-18,Will Smith visits Antarctica with ex-rugby star in seven-continent adventure,science,BBC,"Hollywood actor Will Smith travelled across Antarctica with former Wales rugby star turned global adventurer Richard Parks as his guide, in a new series which sees him visit all seven continents. Parks said teaching the Fresh Prince of Bel Air star about the Earth's southernmost and coldest continent for the show was ""special"". The ex-Dragons player said he felt ""inspired"" by Smith but had to have a few harsh words when he started dancing on the Polar Plateau. He added being in Antarctica ""might be the first time since his childhood Will experienced that kind of isolation"". The documentary series, called Pole to Pole - which Richard said was five years in the making - will see Smith travel across all seven continents and will premiere on 14 January on National Geographic in the UK and Disney+. In each of the seven episodes, Smith was guided by experts, scientists and explorers to discover more about the world. Parks, who was the first explorer to feature in episode one, said it was his job to help Smith ""find the courage and find the skills very quickly to be able to truly experience the continent"". He added there was ""certainly a bond"" between the pair, although ""it's hard to reflect on something like this"". ""I can only imagine what Will's life is like in the real life,"" he told ""But the isolation of Antarctica, it does something to you, it's a real privilege to experience that."" He said the production team was ""relatively tiny"", adding Smith was ""very thoughtful, very humble, really curious"". ""That kind of isolation, the way Antarctica peels back the psychological and social layers we live behind here, it takes you back to the core man. The core person. ""That's what's really special about this, Will's an awesome guy. ""I couldn't help but feel inspired."" Parks explained his main role was ""to keep him safe"" and, while ""arguments is a strong word"",  there were tense moments. ""I did have to have a few harsh words with him when he started dancing on the Polar Plateau, which is not the place to bust moves,"" he said. ""But he's a beautiful, curious soul and we see that in the show."" Parks said he first heard about the show in an email in 2020, under an embargo, adding he was ""still pinching himself"" at the opportunity. ""I didn't get a huge amount of information, it was just a production company saying they're making an adventure science series and asking 'would you be interested talking to them about Antarctica?'. That was it.""

The maned wolf pups - which have yet to be named - were born in November to parents Tolock and Lua at Paignton Zoo, which was recently saved from closure after The zoo said fewer than 17,000 maned pups survive in the wild across South American grasslands and said every birth was ""significant for conservation efforts"". Zoo managers said the behaviour of the pups' parents had been monitored for months and they started to show ""promising signs"" in September before the births happened. Senior mammal keeper Cindy Naylor said: ""We can't believe how well-timed everything was. ""The pair had been together long before the breeding season and we were monitoring their behaviours closely."" She said they were thrilled when Lua conceived ""almost immediately"" after coming into heat and ""it felt like perfect timing"". Maned wolves are South America's largest canids, a group of mammals which include dogs, foxes and jackals. The Canid Specialist Group said the majority live in Brazil and are considered ""near threatened"" due to a loss of habitat. Female maned wolves are only fertile for approximately five days a year, according to the Smithsonian's National Zoo, and have a gestation period of 65 days. The wolves, which stand nearly 1m (3ft) tall and weigh up to 25kg (55lbs), are largely solitary except during breeding season, eating everything from small mammals and insects to fruit and vegetation, according to The species is managed through the European Endangered Species Programme to maintain genetic diversity for potential future reintroduction efforts, the zoo added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e0wypp91ko
2025-12-19,"Ban reindeer live events at Christmas, say animal campaigners",science,BBC,"Animal activists are calling for a ban on reindeer live events this Christmas, claiming their evidence shows serious welfare concerns. The charity One Kind claims it recorded evidence of reindeer in psychological distress at the Merry Milngavie Christmas parade near Glasgow and at other events last year. The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd rejects these concerns, insisting its animals are kept in the best conditions, exceeding licensing requirements. However, One Kind believes the animals were likely to be suffering. Head of campaigns for One Kind, Eve Massie Bishop, told BBC Scotland News: ""We want to see an end to the use of live reindeer at festive displays. ''Each year they are transported to be at busy crowded events where there is often loud noises, loud music, bright lights and crowds of humans and unpredictable interactions. ""Evidence shows that these events are likely leading to reindeer experiencing psychological distress, lack of agency and an unsuitable environment.'' The activists sent footage and photos of reindeer at several events in Scotland last year to animal welfare research and policy consultant Dr Tayla Hammond. She believes there is evidence the animals are in distress. ''The most concerning part for me was how many reindeer showed signs of stress',"" she said. ''We have the wide eyes, showing the white sclera around it, the tense hyper-vigilant posture, heavy breathing and lying down or standing completely still and unresponsive.' ''These are well-recognised signs an animal is stressed and they're struggling to cope with their environment.'' The owners of the Cairngorm Reindeer Herd reject claims these Christmas events cause their animals stress. The herd has been appearing at live events across Scotland throughout November and December. They argue conditions at their festive events exceed animal welfare requirements. Co-owner of Cairngorm Reindeer Herd, Tilly Smith said: ''We have nothing to hide. ''They make comments about how reindeer are scarred by the events that we do, that is not the case. ''We are good, honest reindeer herders and these reindeer come back on the hill after they've done their work.'' She argues critics should come and meet them, talk through any concerns and see for themselves how well they care for these animals. ''We obviously do earn from these events but it is by no means our main source of income. ''Our main source of income comes from people coming to us and enjoying the reindeer on the hill, getting in amongst them, getting to hand feed them.'' Freedom for Animals, which supports the campaign to stop reindeer live events, has recorded in Scotland where the animals are involved in Christmas events. These range from Portree, Lairg and Inverurie to Dunoon, Paisley and Dunfermline. Both campaigners and herders insist they have the reindeer's best interests at heart. The Scottish government said: ''The Animal Welfare (Scotland) Act is clear on the obligations of anyone working with animals to ensure that they are cared for and their needs are met.''",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e0qevl1po
2025-12-18,Petition started to protect city market's pigeons,science,BBC,"A petition has been started to protect pigeons roosting near Norwich Market while the council explores ways to control the number of birds in the area. Norwich City Council has urged people to stop feeding pigeons at the city's war memorial and market after Summer Loh, 19, said the pigeons should be given a food source in the city and the markets should be cleaned regularly to tackle the amount of droppings. Carli Harper, a Labour councillor and cabinet member for finance and major projects, said the authority was considering bringing in fixed penalty notices to stop people from feeding pigeons, which she said was ""hindering the market"". More than 1,200 people have signed the petition, which was created by Ms Loh, calling for the birds to be given a better place to nest. Ms Loh, a university student, believed an abandoned public bathroom in Chapelfield Gardens could be repurposed into a dovecote and rehabilitation office. ""I was a fan of the pigeons before that, but when the discussion about the hawk started, I got very passionate about it,"" she said. Ms Loh believed the areas around the markets should be cleaned regularly. ""The reason [the pigeons] go into the market is it's a source of food and if people were to be banned from feeding them outside the market it would mean their only available source of food would be dropped scraps,"" she added. Ms Loh said she has seen a number of sick pigeons in the city and said a lack of diet leads to the bird's droppings to be more acidic. ""A lot of people consider them to be vermin now which I don't think is very fair... we should treat them like any animal and consider them as lives because that's what they are. ""Innocent lives that deserve to be treated with respect and compassion,"" she added. ""We know from traders they are fed up with having stock ruined, their stalls disrupted by pigeons that are roosting where they are trying to trade and it is a big challenge so we do need people to stop feeding the pigeons,"" Harper said. ""We are just saying don't do it on our war memorial. Don't do it on a market that is roughly 50% food stalls."" While the city council said it has already tried to engage and educate people on the issue, it was looking at taking tougher measures. Harper said: ""This isn't natural behaviour for pigeons, they are being encouraged by people, people who are bringing food in commercial quantities to the war memorial. ""The efforts to clear up the pigeon poo from the war memorial, we are fighting a losing battle at the moment,"" she added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e4923vz7zo
2025-12-18,"How to look after dogs, cats and other pets in cold weather",science,BBC,"Many parts of the UK have experienced cold and snowy weather this winter. Like people, pets can need extra help to stay warm and safe during wintry conditions. Like humans, animals can be at risk of hypothermia if they become too cold. The RSPCA says pets can shiver when they are exposed to low temperatures for too long. This is more noticeable in smaller and short-haired breeds. The PDSA veterinary charity advises giving dogs and cats extra blankets for their beds over the winter months and adding a few more spaces where they can curl up around the home. Raising their beds off the ground can keep older dogs away from draughts, while cats may like playing or resting in high-up dens or on climbing posts. Experts recommend extra playtime to make sure pets keep active if they are spending less time outside. Indoor toys can help. Your pet may want to eat more to help keep their body temperature up. At the same time, they may also want to drink less, but make sure they have constant access to fresh drinking water to avoid the risk of dehydration. Dogs still need walks during cold weather. Usually, their fur will keep them warm. But some dogs - particularly those with shorter fur - may need extra help staying warm while outside. ""For most dogs, their own lovely fur coat is insulation enough, but those with thin fur, or who are unwell, very old or young, may benefit from a good winter coat,"" according to PDSA's Gemma Renwick. ""Look for something well-fitting, waterproof but with a comfy lining."" Walk your dog during the day if you can, or if you have to go out in the dark, consider using LED collars or hi-vis leads to ensure they can be seen. Be cautious when letting dogs off the lead in the snow, and supervise them closely as hazards may be hidden. Similarly, keep pets away from frozen water as the ice on ponds and lakes can be thin and may not support their weight. As the temperatures drop, plan for shorter, more frequent walks rather than one long-distance daily hike and if your dog gets wet, make sure you dry them off with a towel as soon as you get home. Any build-up of salt, grit, dirt or snow can be painful, so owners should check and rinse their pet's paws. Smaller pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs and ferrets can also feel the cold. The PDSA says a sudden drop in temperatures can be a shock to the system for the animals, and recommends moving them inside if they live in outdoor hutches. A shed or car-free garage can offer a good amount of protection from draughts, rain or snow. If you have to bring your animals inside, try and put them in a room which you can keep a bit cooler than the rest of your home. Turn down the radiators if you can. If there is no inside option, the charity advises placing a thick blanket or piece of carpet over their outside living quarters to help keep them warm. Many cats spend a lot of their time exploring the outdoors. During the day, experts say cats who are used to going outside should continue to do so. But the PDSA advises making sure can easily get back inside through a cat flap whenever they want, or have a warm outside shelter where they can go. Ideally cast should stay inside overnight during periods of very cold weather. The charity also recommends providing litter trays inside, even if your cat usually goes outside so they have a warm toileting option. Chickens and hens are incredibly resilient and should typically cope well with a bit of cold weather, the However, during extreme conditions, the charity recommends:",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk7zx7vzko
2025-12-18,How to drive in snow and icy weather,science,BBC,"Driving in severe winter weather can be difficult, and in very bad conditions you should avoid driving at all unless your journey is absolutely essential. But if you do need to use your car in snowy or icy conditions, careful preparations can help. Wear warm clothes and comfortable shoes. Pack a waterproof coat, hat, gloves, sturdy boots and a blanket to keep you warm in case you do get stuck or have to leave your car. You may also need sunglasses in bright weather. Take some food such as chocolate and biscuits, as well as water and a hot drink if you can. Make sure you have a fully charged mobile, a torch and batteries, and any medication you need. Carry a shovel to clear snow and some old bits of carpet, or cat litter, to put under the tyres if you get stuck. Consider buying winter tyres, which offer extra grip, especially if you live in an area which regularly experiences snow. If you have standard tyres, make sure they're inflated at the right pressure, and that each has at least 3mm of tread. Car batteries run down more quickly in winter. Take regular long journeys to keep yours running well, or , which is designed to stop your battery going flat. Keep screen wash topped up and use a proper anti-freeze at the right concentration to prevent ice. If there is a risk of windscreen wipers freezing overnight, place cardboard between the blades and the windscreen. Keep your fuel tank topped up so if you are caught out, you have enough fuel to make it home, or run the engine to keep warm. But if you do get stuck, make sure snow does not block the exhaust, because noxious fumes can leak into the vehicle. If you drive an electric car (EV), remember that the lithium-ion batteries used in most models drain faster when temperatures drop. So EV drivers should factor in more stops at electric charging points during the colder months. If you can, keeping your EV in a garage, or under a cover, can help to improve its battery performance, as can driving in ""eco mode"". Allow extra time before you set off to de-ice the car, and expect journeys to take much longer. Check traffic reports and plan your journey around major roads, which are more likely to be gritted or cleared. Avoid shortcuts on minor roads. Clear all snow and ice from the windscreen, windows and roof of the car before setting off. Do not use boiling water to de-ice windscreens - hot water can crack the glass, and the water will only freeze again on the screen, or on the ground where you are standing. Check your lights are clear of snow and are working. If you drive a manual vehicle, use second gear to pull away, lifting the clutch gently to avoid wheel spin. Stay in a higher gear for better control as you pick up speed. Many automatic cars have a ""snow"" or ""winter"" gearbox mode. Check your handbook for details. Maintain the right speed: too fast and you risk losing control, but driving too slowly means you might lose momentum when you need it. Brake, steer and accelerate as smoothly as possible, and drive so that you do not rely on your brakes to be able to stop. Remember stopping distances can be significantly greater in snow and ice. Leave more space behind the car in front than you usually would. On motorways, stay in the lane clearest of snow, ice and slush, and keep within existing tyre tracks if you can. Motorcycle riders should take extra care in icy conditions and opt for a slower pace, In heavy snow, riders can use snow chains on their tyres to improve traction on slippery roads, it says. If you get stuck, do not try to keep moving if the wheels spin - it will only dig you in deeper. Use a shovel to clear snow from under your tyres. Pour cat litter, sand or gravel in front of the wheels to help them get traction. Shift from forward to reverse and back again. Use gentle pressure on the accelerator until the vehicle gets going. If you cannot move your car, you can stay warm by running the engine. However, it is vital to ensure the exhaust pipe is not blocked by snow because highly toxic carbon monoxide gas could enter the car. If there is any risk of fumes coming into the vehicle, do not run the engine. Even if it is safe, do not run it for more than 10 or 15 minutes in each hour. In heavy snow, it is easy to get disorientated and lost or separated from your vehicle. You can hang a piece of brightly coloured cloth on your car to let you or others find it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xywrq6z4o
2025-12-18,Bin mix-ups cost city council £900k in fines,science,BBC,"An authority has been fined a six-figure sum over residents not putting their rubbish into the right bins. A finance report covering Coventry City Council's expenditure for the three months leading to the end of September said there was a £1.5m overspend by the city services department. According to the report, £900,000 of that overspend was related to contamination fines from non-recyclable waste being put into recycling bins. Conservative group leader councillor Gary Ridley asked the cabinet meeting what is to be done about what he described as ""an absolutely enormous figure"". Mark Adams, the council's acting director of city services, explained that the cost of the fines were high because the council has been charged twice. He said: ""If anything is contaminated, it has to be turned away so it is a double charge – we are charged for taking it in and then we are charged for taking it away to another specialist tip that can take the type of waste."" Mr Adams said that the penalties are part of the council's contract with Sherborne Recycling facility which have only come into effect since April. Councillor Patricia Hetherton, the portfolio holder for city services, said the council are trying to tackle the issue by educating residents about what they can put in their bins. She said: ""It is about education and about making sure that people do understand and know what they can and can't put in their bins. ""We are doing a comms activity with pictures rather than words. ""For instance, at Christmas it is about letting people know that they cannot put anything with glitter on in for recycling.

2025-12-18,Glass collections could be delayed to save money,science,BBC,"A council's plan to introduce kerbside glass recycling for residents could be delayed as part of a cost-cutting plan. But, as part of its budget planning process, it revealed the change could be pushed back to March 2027 to save £380,000. It could also see what it said were expensive bus routes stopped. The council has said it faces a funding gap of about £10m and must protect key services including social care, bin collections and road maintenance. The authority said in June it planned to give people living in houses a 140 litre wheelie bin for glass, which would be collected every month. People living in flats would be given communal 360 litre bins, which would be collected every fortnight. Previously the council said glass collections would be ""costly"" but due to government instructions, the council had ""no choice"" but to implement them. It has also said it could stop funding bus services - the 299 from Bracknell to Winkfield, 598 from Crowthorne to Camberley and 151 and 151A from Bracknell to Wokingham - to save £248,000. It said they ""cost a lot to run and are poorly used in terms of the number of passengers"". It also said some single journeys cost the authority more than £16 each. Paul Bidwell, the council's cabinet member for economy and regeneration, said ""years of underfunding by central government, rising inflation, costs and extra demand for services"" meant the changes were necessary. ""The draft budget looks at how we can make savings but also where we can start to do things a bit differently so residents have a wide range of good quality services by the people best placed to provide them,"" he added. in Bracknell, Crowthorne and Warfield before its consultation on the budget closes on 27 January.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gejp9842xo

The students were nominated for the project by Stephen Ashfield, physics and applied science lecturer at Darlington College in County Durham, who said the class would look at flooding, leaks, pollution and water demand to feed back to the committee. Mr Ashfield said the committee was trying to find out if England would have enough clean water for people, business and nature in 30 years' time. ""I'm really proud of my students, they're proper scientists - they ask awkward questions, they look at the data, and they care what happens to their future,"" he said. ""Our students are going to look at flooding, droughts, leaks, pollution and demand, and then take what they've found straight to members of the House of Lords."" The college is one of six to be chosen for the Lords' youth engagement programme, along with Boston Grammar School, Bullers Wood School for Boys, Northfield School and Sports College, Chesham Grammar School and Stamford College. Miss Butt said the younger generation understood how to spread messages about the environment on social media in ways which were not possible before. Fellow student Olivia Richardson said the project was a brilliant opportunity for young people, especially those under 18 who did not usually have a say. ""We can't vote yet, but we still have opinions, and it means a lot to be able to share our views directly with the people who make decisions that affect our lives,"" she said.

2025-12-18,Decision day for city's three-weekly bin plan,science,BBC,"Residents could have their black bins collected once every three weeks under new plans. The proposal, which would replace current fortnightly collections, will be considered by Bristol City Council's Environment Policy Committee later. Supporters said the change would encourage more recycling and help reduce rising waste disposal costs. But the proposal remains controversial. More than 16,000 people responded to a consultation, with 63% opposing a move to three-weekly collections and 71% saying black-bin collection frequency should remain unchanged. The plan has been under discussion since earlier this year and forms part of a wider push by councils to increase recycling rates and cut landfill. So how does Bristol compare to other local authorities? If approved, Bristol would join other councils moving to less frequent bin collections. has reported a 15% reduction in black-bin waste and a 10% rise in recycling. Councillor Annemieke Waite, cabinet member for planning and environment said they were ""pleased"" with how residents had ""adapted to the new collection schedule"" and the ""improvements in recycling rates"" were ""fantastic"". Meanwhile, South Gloucestershire Council is , a move which has been criticised by the Conservative opposition who said the changes would ""be hugely detrimental"" and would ""cost more money"". The changes in Wiltshire also include the introduction of two new services - kerbside collection of flexible plastics and weekly collections of food waste. By contrast, Bath and North East Somerset Council and Gloucestershire County Council said they had no current plans to change the frequency of black bin collections. The Bristol committee's chair, Green councillor Martin Fodor, said councillors had considered feedback from residents and were also being asked to look at proposals for extra fly-tipping collections and a new community fund to support neighbourhood recycling schemes. He said rising service costs, income from recyclable materials and new government rules requiring councils to recycle more and reduce landfill were key factors behind the proposal. If approved, the changes would include replacing some recycling boxes with coloured sacks, larger blue sacks for paper and magazines, and a new collection service for nappies and incontinence pads. The council estimates moving to three-weekly collections could cut black-bag waste by around 14,700 tonnes a year, increase recycling rates by 10%, and save about £500,000 annually.

It happened at 05:03 GMT with the epicentre of the 2.5 magnitude tremor located off the coast of Silverdale, in Morecambe Bay. The BGS confirmed the quake was an aftershock of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake which hit the area The tremors were reportedly felt as far as 12 miles (19km) away, in the southern Lake District, with people at the time describing the noise as ""deafening"". After the less powerful earthquake earlier, the BGS said people had reported ""a quick sharp shaking jolt and made a thunder noise"" and ""the radiators and pictures rattled"". It told the BBC aftershocks after bigger events are ""not unusual"". The BGS describes aftershocks as smaller earthquakes that occur in the same general area during the days to years following a larger event or ""mainshock."" The earth is made up of huge pieces of flat rock called tectonic plates. Earthquakes are caused by the tectonic plates that make up the earth moving and rubbing together. Where they meet together are called faults. Aftershocks are minor readjustments along the part of a fault that slipped at the time of the mainshock.

2025-12-17,True origin of 'first black Briton' revealed,science,BBC,"Scientists have shed light on the true origins of the so-called ""first black Briton"". The skeletal remains - dating from Roman times - were previously thought to belong to a woman from the sub-Saharan region. This had led her to be dubbed ""one of the earliest Africans in Britain"". But scientists have now said they cannot find DNA evidence that indicates she had recent ancestry from Africa. They detailed in a paper published online on Wednesday that she actually had a strong genetic similarity to individuals from rural Britain. She likely had blue eyes, between pale and dark skin and light hair, scientists added. A craniofacial reconstruction of the ancient skeleton had previously depicted her as having curly black hair, brown eyes and dark skin. The skeleton was first uncovered in 2012 in a box in the basement of Eastbourne Town Hall in East Sussex. The only information on the remains was a label saying 'Beachy Head (1959)' - gaining her the moniker the ""Beachy Head Lady"" after the beauty spot. Multiple attempts to establish her geographical origins and ancestry were made afterwards. The initial assessment that suggested she was of recent sub-Saharan origin was originally based on analysis of her skull in 2013, scientists said. ""The discovery of the 'first black Briton known to us' gained traction across several media outlets, non-fiction books, educational resources and academic publications,"" they wrote in the paper. However, this interpretation began to shift, scientists added. Other scientists later suggested the Beachy Head Lady may have grown up around Eastbourne, but been born in Cyprus. ""Whilst these preliminary results were not published in a scientific journal, they were subsequently reported in the media,"" the paper's authors said. Scientists' latest discovery is based on ""high quality"" DNA data made possible by recent advances in science and technology. The skeleton is radiocarbon dated to between 129 and 311 AD. The Beachy Head Lady is believed to have been aged between 18 and 25 when she died and was an estimated 5ft (1.52m) tall. The scientists have said they cannot determine her cause of death. They cited evidence that fish had been a greater component of her diet, consistent with living on the coast. ' - was published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.

However, after its tag stopped working in ""circumstances that give rise to suspicion'"", Police Scotland wildlife crime officers and colleagues from the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit carried out searches of the area. They failed to find any trace of the eagle and the public is now being asked to come forward with any information. Wildlife crime officer PC Ali Whitby said: ""This is a huge, iconic bird of prey that chose to fly hundreds of miles north and settle in the Moorfoot Hills. ''Being so big its presence was known to people working and living in the area and it thrived for eight months; the fact it has now gone missing in suspicious circumstances is extremely disappointing."" The four-year-old bird was translocated as a chick from Scotland to the Isle of Wight, as part of a reintroduction programme with the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. The eagle then made its way back to Scotland before settling in the Moorfoot Hills. It is the third white-tailed eagle connected to the programme to have disappeared, with the other two located in England and Wales. A spokesperson from the foundation called the disappearances ""sickening and deeply shocking"". Scottish Land & Estates backed the call for information over the bird's disappearance.

Four turbines were removed from the original proposals, following consultations with residents, Dumfries and Galloway Council and environmental bodies. RSPB Scotland had objected to the plans due to concerns over their impact on black grouse but the Scottish government was satisfied that mitigation measures meant the scheme was acceptable. Developers, BayWa r.e, said the wind farm was expected to contribute about £38m in business rates over its lifetime for local services and infrastructure, while creating more than 90 jobs during construction.

But Weymouth and Portland Marine Litter Project, which carries out litter picks at RSPB Radipole Lake, said the area was ""neglected"" and the changes would have a ""negative effect"". RSPB Arne and Weymouth Wetlands said it needed to use its resources where they had the most impact but was looking at how it could support volunteers to take on path maintenance. Dave Taylor, co-founder of the marine litter project, said: ""It's just sad. People don't know there's a nature reserve on their doorstep - it's just a neglected lake next to a big car park and supermarket. ""We do quarterly litter picks and get tonnes of rubbish from there.

2025-12-17,What were Scotland's top archaeological finds in 2025?,science,BBC,"Evidence of feasting in the Hebrides 5,000 years ago and the discovery of a lost medieval settlement in the Borders have been listed among Scotland's biggest finds of 2025. The Dig It! project also includes a Dumfriesshire hillfort possibly besieged by the Romans, and the remains of a Bronze Age site in Shetland used for heating up water. The strangest artefact on the list is a silver charm unearthed on the Black Isle and once used to protect a person and their animals against elfshot - tiny arrows fired by elves. Science later revealed elfshot to be prehistoric flint arrowheads. The project was co-ordinated by the 240-year-old Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Society director Dr Simon Gilmour said: ""This year's top discoveries collated by our Dig It! project bring to light human stories from Scotland's past across five millennia; from cuisine and conflict to past beliefs and world views."" Several clues of Neolithic people gathering for feasts were uncovered by Daniel Brown, a PhD researcher at the University of Bristol, in the Western Isles. He examined pots recovered from sites of crannogs - homes built on artificial islands on lochs. The style and decoration of some of the pots did not changed for about 800 years, which Mr Brown suggested meant there was ""something symbolic"" about the designs. Analysis also revealed traces of meat, rather than more commonly found dairy products, and high amounts of fish - a rare food in Neolithic times. In Shetland, volunteers led by Archaeology Scotland and Scape Trust excavated a Bronze Age site at Gletness near Nesting. They found a complex burnt mound and what might be the remains of a well. Burnt mounds are thought to be the by-product of a method of heating water by dropping hot stones into a water-filled trough. The archaeological evidence of these mounds include piles of ash, charcoal and fire-damaged stones. Complex burnt mounds are stone structures that have small rooms inside them. Dig It! said the reason why people were heating water in this way remained a mystery, but theories include beer-making or saunas. Meanwhile, archaeologists suggest in Dumfriesshire was besieged by an invading Roman force about 1,900 years ago. Survey work by a team from the University of Glasgow, Trimontium Trust and University of Manchester found the site was more densely occupied during the time of the Roman invasion than previously thought. They believe this made the fort a prime target for a Roman army. Subsequent excavations also revealed traces of a major phase of rampart construction or re-modelling. This has been interpreted as the hillfort's inhabitants having survived or returned after a siege and beginning to rebuild. The University of Glasgow's Dr James O'Driscoll said: ""These findings offer a rare glimpse into how Iron Age communities in Scotland built, defended, and re-imagined their world in response to Roman power. ""It's a story of resilience, identity, and survival that challenges long-held assumptions about Scotland's past."" A lost medieval village was excavated at Horndean as part of the The area had long been suspected to be the location of a settlement. AOC Archaeology worked with volunteers to unearth animals bones and pottery produced roughly around the 12th Century. The settlement's location adjacent to a ruined medieval church has led experts to believe that the community was associated with or working for the church, perhaps by providing food. Archaeologists said it was rare to find lowland rural settlements from this period as the sites were often heavily damaged by later ploughing. Uncovering the Tweed's archaeologist Cathy MacIver said: ""It is really exciting for our team of volunteers to have identified new evidence for a buried medieval site at Horndean. ""The unusually well-preserved animal bone in particular is going to shed new light on the diet and daily life of this medieval community living on the Tweed."" The Treasure Trove Unit (TTU) confirmed the discovery of an elfshot amulet in April. Uncovered near Fortrose by metal detectorist Lawrence Deans, the artefact contains a Bronze Age flint arrowhead which had been found by someone in the 17th or 18th Century and mounted in a silver pendant as a charm. In the past, people believed small, prehistoric arrowheads they found in fields were the weapons of elves and fairies and fired at cattle, horses and even humans to cause them harm. TTU said some people believed that turning elfshot into a charm could heal injuries and protect against being attacked again. The amulet is to go on display at Groam House Museum in Rosemarkie next year. Dr George Prew-Stell, treasure trove officer at National Museums Scotland, said: ""This is a wonderful example of people in the past finding and reusing objects made by communities who lived on the same land millennia earlier. ""This artefact provides a rare, tangible example of two of the most wonderful things about studying historic communities: folklore, and people interacting with their own past.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmnlpy0jljo

Meanwhile, a petition calling for the closure to be halted has surpassed 3,000 signatures. A Hills spokesman said the contract fees were based on costs increasing significantly over recent years. Councillor Ian Thorn, Wiltshire Council leader, said the price proposed for the contract renewal ""was substantially higher than the current arrangement"" and ""would have placed considerable financial pressure on the council"". Purton Parish Council leaders say they will pursue all possible avenues to challenge the decision to close their ""much-valued and heavily used"" recycling centre. Meanwhile, South Cotswolds MP Roz Savage has issued an open letter to councillor Thorn calling for urgent action.

Newton Rigg College in Penrith shut in 2021 and Kendal College - 35 miles (56km) away - is now the only further education provider of land-based courses in Cumbria. The college said it was trying to help with transport and remote learning but did not get extra government support. The government has been approached for comment. Sophie Rear, who lives in Aspatria, said her travel, which sees her get up at 05:30, take two buses and then drive, was ""absolutely draining"". The 18-year-old, who is in the final year of an animal care T-level, often takes a bus to Carlisle, a second to a friend's house and then they drive to Kendal. Adding in her part-time job in a local takeaway and looking after her three dogs, she had little time for anything else, she said. ""I used to go out after college but now that I've been doing it for a while, it's just absolutely draining,"" she said. ""I just want to go to bed."" The college has allowed students on her course to work from home on Fridays to help with the commute. ""It's nice because I get up at, like, five to nine [and] get a lie-in,"" she said. Miss Rear is also one of 377 students at the college to receive a bursary to help with travel costs. More than 200 students study courses they could once have taken at Newton Rigg and travel from as far as Workington, Carlisle, Brampton and Barrow-in-Furness. Dan Stamper, who previously worked at Newton Rigg and is now head of faculty for agriculture, animal care and health at Kendal College, said travelling long distances in rural Cumbria brought challenges. Those included a student who travelled from Workington and was stuck when bad weather led to the cancellation of her buses, he said. ""It just adds a layer of complexity that learners in other areas of the country don't have to even consider,"" he said. ""If you're travelling from one side of London to the other by Tube, you're not having to deal with as much mental load as a learner that's travelling by bus from Workington to Kendal three days a week."" To combat longer journey times, the college runs a satellite site at Hope's Auction Mart in Wigton, allowing agricultural apprentices to learn there once a week. Students who need to continue studying English and Maths alongside vocational courses do these lessons in three-week blocks in Kendal to reduce travel time, with Mr Stamper picking them up from Wigton and dropping them back off. ""The system is definitely working and improving their outcomes, but the argy-bargy of moving them around the county is considerable,"" he said. Attending lessons together gave students mental health and social benefits as well as the skills they needed to work on the land or with animals, he said. ""It's important that a 16-year-old in a very rurally isolated area, doing a very isolated job, has the opportunity to meet with their peers, for their mental health,"" Mr Stamper said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjzpr5r7o

The announcement comes after the 2025 season was Any payments made from the scheme will be based on the value of brown eels brought ashore during the 2024 season only. To be considered eligible applicants will need to have landed a minimum of £1000 worth of brown eels. The vessel they used for fishing will need to have been issued with a license to fish in Lough Neagh from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) and a permit from the Lough Neagh Fishermen's Cooperative. Similar to the Covid support scheme, payments will be equal to 50% of the annual income fishers lost out on because of the suspension. That decision was made after the reduced fat content of the eels meant the early catches were rejected by the continental market that usually prizes them.

They are the UK's largest bird of prey with a wingspan of up to 2.5m (8.2ft) and are monitored by the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. They are protected under UK legislation, making it illegal to kill, injure or take them. Police have urged anyone who was in the following areas to contact officers: Officers said the bird's satellite tag was found in nearby remote woodland and they believed it was likely removed with a knife before being hidden. Many birds of prey, such as white-tailed eagles, golden eagles and hen harriers, are fitted with tags for scientific research and conservation reasons. The force said efforts to find the bird had so far been unsuccessful, despite analysis of DNA and fingerprints. It comes as police forces in England The eagles, also known as sea eagles, were hunted to extinction in They were successfully reintroduced in England after a The eagles were then released in the Isle of Wight which went on to establish territories in Wales, Lincolnshire, Dorset and Sussex. White-tailed eagles are not dangerous to humans and generally only attack in self-defence. People typically hunt or persecute white-tailed eagles as they were considered a threat to game birds such as pheasants and grouse, as well as livestock.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87lwj35z8do
2025-12-17,Life-sized marble Triceratops skull unveiled,science,BBC,"A life-sized dinosaur head carved from a single piece of marble has been unveiled in central London. Carrara Triceratops Skull is described as an ""artistic interpretation"" of a 68-million-year-old sub-adult Triceratops skull, and measures 10ft (3m) high, 7.2ft (2.2m) long, and 5ft (1.5m) wide. The skull rests at a 20-degree angle on a grey-veined plinth in Berkeley Square. Sculptor Paul Vanstone said: ""The idea that these creatures walked this planet, charging at this angle, you get a strong sense of their presence on this planet. I wanted to portray their great scale and power."" The prehistoric herbivores roamed the plains of what is now North America about 68-66 million years ago. Its flaring bony frill, pointed beak and three-horned head make the Triceratops one of the more recognisable dinosaurs. The species goes through four growth stages - baby, juvenile, sub-adult and adult - and reached full maturity aged about 10. During the sub-adult growth period the Triceratops horns reorient to point towards the front of the skull and the scalloped detail of the frill becomes more defined. The sculpture will remain on display for two years and is the second public artwork displayed by David Aaron, replacing the bronze juvenile Tyrannosaurus Rex that previously occupied the site. The work can be seen at 29 Berkeley Square, located on the corner.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde65y7p995o
2025-12-15,'My find in a field connects me to lives long ago',science,BBC,"A metal detectorist who discovered a 1,500-year-old scabbard chape in a field has recalled the ""thrill"" of a find giving ""connection to lives lived centuries ago"". Kathy Bonehill found the decorative copper-alloy piece, which dates back to between AD400 and AD600, on the edge of a farmer's field in Kings Newnham in Rugby. Scabbard chapes were used in medieval times to protect the sheath of a dagger or tip of a sword. The British Museum's Portable Antiquities Scheme, which keeps a record of archaeological finds in England and Wales, declared the one in Rugby a ""find of note"". Ms Bonehill has donated the possibly Viking-used item to Rugby Art Gallery and Museum, where it is on display. Reliving her discovery earlier this year, she said: ""I've been metal detecting in the Warwickshire countryside with a regular group for a couple of years, uncovering some fascinating items along the way, yet nothing compares to this stunning dagger chape. ""At first, it was clagged with dirt, its beautiful detail hidden beneath layers of grime. ""Only after an hour of patient work with a wooden cocktail stick did the design begin to emerge - and I realised I was holding something truly special, perhaps even unique."" Experts said the chape's decorative design featured a human face flanked by a pair of birds - possibly representing Odin, the chief god in Norse mythology, and his ravens, Huginn and Muninn. Ring-and-dot motifs run along the lower edge of both birds and vertically through the ""body"" of the human form. Weighing just nine grams, the chape measures three-and-a-half centimetres in length, two-and-a-half in width and just under a centimetre in thickness at its widest part. Ms Bonehill added: ""There's a thrill in moments like this. ""The slow reveal of craftmanship long buried, the sense of connection to lives lived centuries ago."" Councillor Neil Sandison from Rugby Borough Council thanked Ms Bonehill for her donation. He said: ""What a marvellous find. We had been aware Vikings had been active in the Rugby area and this now provides evidence of them being present in medieval Warwickshire.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjnz218vp5o
2025-12-14,Forecasters warn of floods as amber rain alert issued,science,BBC,"Forecasters are warning of likely flooding and dangers from fast flowing water as a prolonged period of heavy rain sweeps across Scotland. An amber alert came into force at midnignt for the south west of the country, while a lesser yellow warning covers much of the western mainland. 50-70mm of rain could fall widely in the amber area, rising to 110-130mm in the Galloway Hills and other parts of the Southern Uplands during Sunday. Homes and businesses were likely to be flooded and fast flowing rivers or floodwater could pose a ""danger to life"" while bus and rail travellers face possible cancellations or delays, it warned. Overnight the A78 in Greenock had to be closed due to flooding. Traffic Scotland said the road between the town and Inverkip remained shut in both directions because of water on the carriageway. A diversion is in place, taking traffic along the coast road via Gourock. The Met Office amber warning covers much of southwest Scotland, including Dumfries & Galloway, Scottish Borders, parts of South Lanarkshire and parts of Ayrshire, lasting for the whole day. Strong and gusty south westerly winds are also expected throughout Sunday, worsening conditions. Separate yellow weather warnings are already in place across much of the country, including Glasgow, Fife and Stirling. These warnings will run to either the end of Sunday or 09:00 on Monday, depending on the area. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has issued 10 flood regional alerts ahead of the worst of the rain, with ScotRail has already cancelled Sunday services between Kilmarnock and Dumfries as a precaution. Police Scotland said people should avoid travelling unless it was necessary while Transport Scotland warned travel was likely to be affected by the poor conditions. Scottish Borders Council said a multi-agency incident response group will operate from the council's emergency control centre from 07:00 on Sunday, to co-ordinate the response and any recovery efforts. Regular updates for the public will be provided via The local authority said it would monitor river levels with Sepa, while surface water flooding could also become an issue. The Scottish government's transport secretary, Fiona Hyslop, advised people to plan ahead and leave plenty of time for journeys. She said the heavy rain was ""likely to impact the transport network"". Hyslop added:  ""It's important people plan their journeys before they set off. Motorists should make sure their routes are available, follow the travel advice from Police Scotland and drive in accordance with the conditions. ""If you are planning to travel by train, ferry or plane, please check with your operators to see if the conditions are having any impact on your services."" Police Scotland Supt Andrew Barclay, of the force's Road Policing Unit said motorists should ""drive to the conditions and be aware of increased stopping distances"", as well as having alterative routes planned. He added that people should make sure to have sufficient fuel, warm clothing, food and water, as well as a charged mobile phone, in case affected by the disruption. Traffic on the A83 Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll as a safety precaution in case of landslides. A decision on returning traffic to the A83 trunk road will be made on Monday, following safety inspections of the road and the hillside. As well as cancelling Kilmarnock to Dumfries services, ScotRail said there would be speed restrictions on some routes. the rail operator stated: ""As a safety precaution, speed restrictions will come into force along sections of our Oban, Fort William, Mallaig and Kyle of Lochalsh routes. ""These will be introduced from 18:00 this evening and remain in place until 09:00 on Monday. Please be aware that journey times will take longer as a result."" A number of CalMac ferry services have also been cancelled due to strong winds The warning comes just days after It saw amber wind warnings in place in north-west Scotland, and the M74 shut between junctions 12 and 13 near Abington in South Lanarkshire after high winds toppled numerous HGVs on Tuesday evening. The second named storm of the season also caused problems for rail travellers with fallen trees and damaged overhead cables, and more than 1,000 properties lost power.

2025-12-16,'Crazy Englishman' growing olives the Italian way,science,BBC,"A farmer says the changing climate has allowed him to grow and harvest what is believed to be Lincolnshire's first commercial crop of olives. David Hoyles, whose family has farmed the Fens for more than 200 years, has grown the fruit on 25-acres (10-hectares) of land at Long Sutton. ""We were seeing climate change making it sometimes difficult for some of our conventional crops, we're getting warmer, drier periods,"" he said. The olives have been hand-harvested and crushed to extract oil which has been bottled for public sale. Mr Hoyles' windswept grove is one of the world's most northerly commercial olive farms. He has spent the last five years researching the specialist techniques needed for a successful harvest. ""We first looked at grapes but they didn't suit our soil type. Olives is something of an extreme choice but one we've gone for,"" he said. Mr Hoyles planted his olive crop in 2024 after fact-finding trips to Italy, which saw him collaborate with other farmers who said it had been ""fantastic"". The Italian farmers helped Mr Hoyles to research the various species of olive tree and assess their suitability for growing in Lincolnshire. ""They [the Italians] call me the 'crazy Englishman' but they've all been willing to share their knowledge, share their passion and enthusiasm,"" he said. Mr Hoyles said the decision to plant more than 18,000 olive trees on his farm had been driven by ""pragmatism"" but also because he ""loves a challenge"". Mr Hoyles, who is growing the olives alongside more conventional crops such as wheat, sugar beet, potatoes and peas said he had installed wind turbines and solar panels to improve energy self-sufficiency. Additional reservoirs have also been constructed to provide extra water for the crops during dry periods. He said: ""We're finding that the textbook way of growing olives isn't how we do it in the UK; the season timings are different and we are learning and adapting all the time."" For decades it has been possible to produce warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers Mr Hoyles believes there is an opportunity for farms like his to diversify. ""Seeing the climate change is one reason why we have invested, although we are on the edge of where the [olive] trees will survive,"" he said.

2025-12-14,Scotland's energy - election common ground or battleground?,science,BBC,"When you look out across the vast Grangemouth industrial complex, it appears more like a monument to Scotland's economic past than a vision of the future. earlier this year with the loss of 400 jobs was a stark reminder of the challenges posed by the transition from fossil fuels to a more renewable energy-based economy. There was a notable moment of common purpose between the UK and Scottish governments this week. Ministers from Westminster and Holyrood came together in Grangemouth at a ceremony to break ground for The Edinburgh-based firm MiAlgae plans to produce Omega 3s from the by-products of whisky distilling instead of from fish. This project, which is presented as a more sustainable form of production, is receiving financial support from both governments. It's one example of an alternative industry for Grangemouth. Others - from hydrogen production, to breaking down plastics that are hard to recycle - are proposed in While Labour and the SNP are cooperating on this agenda as Scotland's two parties of power, it's worth remembering that they are also ferocious political rivals. Together with an array of other parties they are about to contest the 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament. It's increasingly clear that tensions over how best to manage the wider energy transition will feature prominently in the Holyrood election campaign. First Minister John Swinney made clear his intention to make energy an important element of the SNP's campaign this week. Revising the party's 1970s slogan ""It's Scotland's oil"" Swinney declared that in the era of wind, wave and solar, ""It's Scotland's energy"". Essentially his argument is that with Scottish independence these resources could be better managed to reduce bills for households and businesses by a third. An SNP paper on the subject does not show exactly how the price cuts are calculated or how any loss of contributions from UK bill payers to upgrading the Scottish transmission system could be offset. Given that any reforms are linked to the creation of a Scottish state following a ""yes"" vote in a future referendum, the timescale for any household savings is unclear. It is obviously not a policy proposal that is designed to ease the cost of living pressures faced by electricity consumers right now. It does however highlight that energy policy is currently under Westminster rather than Holyrood control. The SNP may consider that a useful way of pointing out that electricity bills are going up on Labour's watch even if the Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced plans to take the edge off increases by cutting certain surcharges. By returning to the issue of independence, the Conservatives said John Swinney was pursuing his ""lifelong obsession"" and Labour said he was ""stuck in the past"". It so happens both these parties were promoting health-related policies on the same day, believing this to be an area where the SNP is more vulnerable. This is not the only energy-related argument that is likely to develop during the campaign. The Conservatives are already making the case for the UK to ""maximise extraction"" of oil and gas from the North Sea. Reform UK takes a similar position. Both parties want the energy profits levy on oil and gas producers to end. That position is also advanced by the SNP. They have yet to clarify if the ""presumption against"" new oil and gas developments articulated when Nicola Sturgeon was first minister will be retained in the next version of the Scottish government's energy strategy. The prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has defended the continuation of the energy profits levy and highlighted the relaxation of rules on drawing more oil and gas from areas close to existing fields as a concession to the industry. To be clear, North Sea taxation and licensing is a UK government responsibility. The Scottish government that is formed after next May's election cannot change the policy but that does not prevent parties arguing their positions in the Holyrood campaign. Another energy divide exists over the potential for a new generation of nuclear power in Scotland. Labour and the Conservatives are in favour, the Liberal Democrats are equivocal and  the SNP and Greens are against. While new nuclear plants require UK government approval, any proposed developments in Scotland could be blocked by the Scottish government using its planning powers. Pro-nuclear parties argue that new plants would create jobs and provide electricity when the wind's not blowing. Anti-nuclear parties criticise the cost of nuclear developments and their legacy of radioactive waste. Where there is broad agreement is that there are valuable new industrial opportunities to be secured in the renewable energy sector but these are not without controversy. The location of wind farms and the infrastructure needed to get the electricity they produce to market is a source of considerable tension. Then there's the offer of Chinese investment in a major wind turbine production facility at Ardersier, near Inverness, which is receiving extra careful consideration on security grounds. To repeat, many of these matters are subject to UK decision making or an interplay between Westminster and Holyrood powers. But there are no limits to what can be discussed in any election campaign. Expect the Holyrood 2026 contest to be animated by debate over Scotland's energy future as well as those issues over which the Scottish Parliament has full control.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74x0p3nnkzo
2025-12-14,Floods fears recede as amber rain warning downgraded,science,BBC,"An amber weather warning for heavy rain and possible flooding for south-west Scotland has been downgraded by forecasters. The Met Office issued the alert on Saturday as a band of very heavy rain moved in, prompting fears that homes and buildings in the region could be flooded. While the rain has not been as heavy as predicted, a lesser yellow warning remains in force for much of western Scotland with heavy localised downpours forecast. In Inverclyde, the A78 road in Greenock remains shut in both directions due to flooding after a night of heavy rain. Traffic Scotland said the road between the town and Inverkip remained shut in both directions because of water on the carriageway. A diversion is in place, taking traffic along the coast road via Gourock. At the A83 Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll, which is prone to landslides, traffic is being directed along the Old Military Road diversion route as a safety precaution with inspections of the hillside planned on Monday. ScotRail had earlier cancelled train services between Kilmarnock and Dumfries ahead of the amber warning. The Met Office update said there was still a chance of flooding and travel disruption while drivers would face difficult conditions in some places. The yellow warning for rain remains in force throughout Sunday in the west of Scotland extending up to the north-west Highlands, Skye and the Inner Hebrides.

Echo Wood, between Bristol and Bath, is the latest project by artist Luke Jerram who created a giant Earth artwork When finished, Echo Wood will feature 365 different species of trees planted in a circular pattern. The permanent installation at the centre of the new Lower Chew Forest in Compton Dando, will encircle an events space it is hoped will be used for generations. ""It's really exciting - you really get a sense of the sort of the curving nature of the archways and entrance ways into the artwork and you get a sense of the scale of it as well,"" said Jerram. Known internationally for his large-scale installations like the Museum of the Moon, as well as introducing pianos in public places, the Bristol-based artist told the BBC: ""I really like making artwork that leaves space for other people to be creative."" He added: ""Echo Wood is an artwork just like that - it's both this installation artwork but also an event space that people can activate in the coming years. ""When you leave space for other people to be creative, that's when things get really interesting."" Created by the charity Avon Needs Trees, the Lower Chew Forest will be a 420-acre site on Wick Farm containing more than 100,000 new trees and shrubs. The organisation said it wants to boost woodland cover in . which it says is just 7.8% compared to the national average of 13.2%, and improve biodiversity ""I've been making artwork that communicates the issues of the climate crisis and thinks about climate change quite a lot, but this is the first time I've created a project that will physically do something about it,"" said Jerram. The 365 lanterns used to show the shape and scale of the project were created by 12 community groups from the local area, who decorated them with nature-inspired patterns. ""It's incredible to think that our children will grow with the artwork and that it will still be around when they're parents themselves, or even grandparents,"" said Warrick Barton, head teacher of Pensford Primary School where pupils took part in creating the lanterns. Members of the public have been asked to get involved in the project by sponsoring a tree, which Jerram said meant they would ""get to leave a message for the future generations or [their] ancestors"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8d3z8vp47o

Councillors at Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council have given the go-ahead for the new facility, which will be situated on Goose House Lane in Darwen. It will replace two older facilities - Blackburn's George Street tip, which was  branded ""an embarrassment"" by council leader Phil Riley - and Spring Vale Road in Darwen. The plan was first mooted in 2022 but was shelved because of the cost-of-living crisis. Initially costed at about £5m, council leader Riley said it was ""long overdue"". ""The existing facility at George Street West is an embarrassment, he said. ""I am really excited about this."" Opposition 4BwD group leader, councillor Mustafa Desai, agreed. Environment boss councillor, Jim Smith, who proposed the move, said the George Street West household waste recycling centre was no longer able to meet demand efficiently, with residents having to wait up to 45 minutes in a queue of vehicles to use it. He said Spring Vale Road, Darwen, was not as bad but still well short of the standards customers should expect. Smith said the new centre – with separate access points for cars and trucks – should increase recycling rates in the borough by being quicker and easier to use.

2025-12-15,Concern for NI waterways as invasive mussel detected,science,BBC,"A highly invasive species of mussel which can cause extensive environmental damage to waterways has been detected in Northern Ireland for the first time. The quagga mussel is a non-native mollusc from eastern Europe which breeds extremely quickly, often out-competing and replacing other mussels. Quantities of quagga were collected during routine surveys in Lower Lough Erne and on 10 December the species was formally identified through DNA analysis. Stormont's Agriculture and Environment Minister Andrew Muir said its detection is ""another significant pressure to our already beleaguered freshwater system"". ""Increased vigilance and surveillance is critical,"" the minister said in a statement. ""My officials are engaging with stakeholders and public agencies to alert them to this arrival and the need for enhanced biosecurity measures."" Quagga mussels are considered a costly environmental threat because they can affect water quality, disrupt ecosystems and clog up pipes. They were first detected in the UK more than a decade ago and are also present in the Republic of Ireland, but this is the first confirmed detection in Northern Ireland, Daera said. the tiny creatures are usually the size of a thumbnail, but they can grow up to up to about 1.5 in (4cm). An adult female can produce up to 1m eggs per year, making them prolific breeders, and their eggs are so small they are not visible to the naked eye. Quagga mussels are similiar to zebra mussels - another non-native mollusc which has already extensively damaged Northern Ireland's biggest lake - Lough Neagh. Both invasive species feed on microscopic organisms and while eating they can filter a litre or more of water each day. This process of filtration makes the water clearer, which in turn can allow other species to grow and disrupt delicate habitats. The zebra mussel is believed to have contributed to the conditions which has allowed due to the presence of zebra mussels, as the fish could not be used to stock waters. Quagga mussels are capable of even higher water filtration rates than zebra mussels and they can also survive in a wider range of depths. Daera said it expects quagga mussels will ""eventually outcompete and displace"" zebra mussels. Daera added that it is ""plausible that quagga are already present but undetected in intermediate water bodies, including Upper Lough Erne"". The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) said there is ""no effective control or eradication method for quagga mussel once it has established in a water body"". However, there are ways to slow the spread of the creatures and reduce the risk of them entering other waterways. Rose Muir from NIEA's Invasive Non Native Species team said the best way to do this is through biosecurity measures known as the ""check, clean, dry approach"". This involves asking all anglers and boaters to thoroughly clean any equipment before using any waterway. ""We are urging all water users to follow this protocol strictly when moving between water bodies,"" Ms Muir said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25gjvk72zo

2025-12-15,Sewage discharged into harbour after tug boat fault,science,BBC,"Sewage from a tug boat that discharged into a harbour has been contained, according to port authorities. The BBC has been told that staff were informed in an email from Portland Port, Dorset, that sewage had been discharging from the Maiden Castle, one of three tugs operating in the harbour. Bill Reeves, chief executive of Portland Port, said ""action was taken immediately"" and that the fault has ""now been fixed"". Dorset Council said it will investigate whether the leak is linked to and is demanding an explanation. But the Environment Agency (EA) said this was ""unlikely"" to have been the cause for the change in bathing water quality as other beaches in the area had not shown any deterioration. Information passed to the BBC says that staff at the port were told last week the sewage containment tank on Maiden Castle had been discharging sewage into the harbour and they were told the facilities were not available on board the vessel. Mr Reeves said: ""It was discovered on 20 November that there was an issue with waste from the Maiden Castle tug being directed into the sea rather than its onboard containment tank. ""Portland Port takes this matter extremely seriously and action was taken immediately as soon as the issue was identified with marine staff told to cease the use of the onboard facilities."" He explained the fault was with the waste control system that has now been fixed and that an internal investigation has been launched. The port said Maiden Castle is one of three tugs at the port with a four-strong crew and is predominately used as a stand-by tug when other tugs are not available. Mr Reeves said: ""It is manned only during operational duties, which have averaged 2.4 hours per week during 2025."" The port's two other tugs are unaffected and the port said their waste systems are ""in good working order"". The BBC was also told that the sewage tank on board the Maiden Castle had not been emptied for more than ten years. In response, Portland Port said: ""Our energies are focused on ensuring that the problem is fixed, and that we put in place procedures to ensure that it doesn't occur again."" Nick Ireland, leader of Dorset Council and cabinet member for climate change and the environment said: ""Weymouth lost this blue flag... and I am wondering now if this is possibly part of the cause. ""I'll be asking our officers to write to the port and ask them what's really behind this and if it is true and we'll take it from there."" An EA spokesperson said: ""We are investigating the longer-term causes of the deterioration in bathing water quality at Weymouth Central beach which has brought its classification from Excellent to Good. ""This pollution incident is unlikely to be the cause of the loss of blue flag status, as the two beaches that are close to the port have not shown a deterioration in bathing water quality.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yddpqjwx2o
2025-12-13,Get set for the festive tractor convoys,science,BBC,"The spectacle of tractor convoys travelling through towns and villages while covered in fairy lights, decorations and inflatable snowmen has taken off - with events planned across the West Midlands up to and beyond Christmas. Farmers stage displays to raise money for various causes and charities, and among this year's beneficiaries are Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital and Midlands Air Ambulance. Emily Jones, from the farming mental health charity We are Farming Minds, said: ""It is a sight to behold, especially if you're not within the farming community."" She said the convoys were all about creating not just a display, but also camaraderie as communities turned out to watch. Tractor runs planned this weekend include displays by in Warwickshire on both days and the At the Sheepy tractor run, farmer Martin Brandreth said most drivers The first day of the Sheepy run goes through North Warwickshire, and the second day takes in Bedworth, Nuneaton and Coventry.

""It's been a lot easier than we thought,"" Mr Shaw said. He put a message out to farmers on WhatsApp and Facebook, and found sponsors so they could raise as much money as possible. He said they wanted to support the mental health charity because farmers could get isolated and ""it can be quite tough being out in the field on your own"" and they wanted to do their part. The idea was to provide ""a bit of entertainment"", he said. ""I've been on quite a few tractor runs in the last couple of years and the amount of people that come out, stand outside their houses and put money in the bucket – it gets everybody in the Christmas spirit."" Tractor runs began back in the 1970s and had absolutely nothing to do with Christmas. Vintage tractor road-runs were held throughout the year, often in spring or summer, to celebrate farming heritage and show classic tractors. In the mid-80s, organised tractor runs became more common and an early key figure was Ashley Godsall, who that grew quickly and raised money for charities. His idea inspired farmers to organise tractor runs as a way to celebrate Christmas together - they added everything from fairy lights to tinsel and bows. From there, events grew into a full-blown festive phenomenon all across the country. Leominster deputy mayor Allan Williams said the town would see about 70 vehicles on a seven-mile route on Saturday, in ""They will be gloriously decorated,"" he said. ""Hereford was brilliant last Saturday. We hope to follow suit."" He said the event had returned by popular demand, adding: ""The young and the not-so-young will be out in droves, loving it.""

The wildland was once a royal hunting ground of the last Saxon king Harold Godwinson in 1066, and has also housed a 96-horse stables. But now the ancient woodland is being revitalised with the pigs - half wild boar, half Tamworth - which are turning over the soil. The introduction in the future of cattle and ponies should also help restore natural processes in the landscape and also help manage the deer population. Conifer plantations on the estate are being cleared, allowing native saplings space to grow. Ponds will be put in during the winter and steps will be taken to slow the flow of water off the land, and to reduce flooding beyond the estate. Machinery has been used to cut a huge muddy track to open up the woods and create what Harold's Park site manager Tom Moat describes as an ""artery of wildlife through the woodland"". ""This won't be mud for long; the grass will come and then the flowers behind it,"" he said. Mr Moat said ""nothing is working as it should"" in the landscape, which has lost beavers and bison, herds of wild boar and big herbivores. Deer are not behaving naturally as a result. ""We are replacing that, and as a re-wilding company, we're trying to do that as light touch as we can and letting nature do the rest,"" he said. Mr Moat said it would be ""exciting"" to see how the landscape evolved, with land which is currently fields softening into scrubland and wood pasture. This will be beneficial for a host of wildlife and rare species, including nightingales. Nattergal hopes to open up the nature reserve for children from urban areas, on educational trips. Dr Simon Lyster, chairman of the Essex Local Nature Partnership, agrees that the likes of nightingales and turtle doves could come to the site. The reserve could ease the pressure on other outdoor spaces that suffer from high numbers of tourists, Dr Lyster explained. ""The soft engineering is very important and has been very successful elsewhere,"" Dr Lyster said. ""It creates space for wild plants, protects the scrub areas, which is very good for nightingales. ""At Hatfield Forest [in Essex], 20 years ago that got 100,000 local visitors per year, and now they get 600,000. ""And now there's a problem with visitor pressure. Harold's Park will help alleviate pressure from the places that are getting too much."" Dr Lyster expects quick results. ""It's quite extraordinary how quickly nature recovers,"" he added. Harold's Park was identified as a high priority area in Essex's Local Nature Recovery Strategy, published earlier this year. Essex County Council's Conservative cabinet member for the environment, Peter Schwier, visited last year. ""It will be an opportunity for anyone interested in nature and re-wilding to benefit from learning a lot about it,"" he said. ""It's going to be a great day out, completely different to the average of what goes on at the moment.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1196m605o

Gloucestershire County Council had announced Hempsted Household Recycling Centre (HRC) would close in January for essential repairs and improvements. But after further assessments more groundwork is needed on the landfill site and reopening by Easter - the centre's busiest time - would not be feasible, the council said. Councillor Martin Horwood said the council was sorry for any disruption this may cause local households. The site, which is run by the council's not-for-profit company Ubico, Mr Horwood said: ""We'll keep residents updated as soon as we have confirmed dates."" In a statement, the council said the improvements will make the centre safer, more sustainable, and easier to use. This include new surfaces, modern waste compactors powered by renewable energy and a new reuse shop where items can be repaired and given a second life. They will also add better protection for electrical waste and new EV charging points for service vehicles.

2025-12-12,Thousands under evacuation orders as flooding hits Pacific Northwest,science,BBC,"Residents in the Pacific Northwest of the US and western Canada are bracing for potentially life-threatening floods as several days of heavy rain have swollen a number of rivers and tributaries. On Thursday, the National Water Center reported heavy flooding along the Skagit and Snohomish rivers in the state of Washington that is expected to continue through Friday. In Canada, major highways to Vancouver have been closed because of flooding, debris and the risk of avalanches. There are evacuation orders in place for thousands of people in the US and Canada, and authorities have warned more rain is on the way. In the US, the governor of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, declared a and estimated 100,000 residents could face evacuation orders. The emergency declaration warned that rain and possibly snow at mountain elevations would exacerbate flooding conditions. Governor Ferguson said there were no reports of fatalities, but warned residents the risk wasn't over yet. ""The flooding levels we're looking at are potentially historic in nature, so we just want to emphasise how serious the situation is,"" Ferguson said at a news briefing, The Skagit River ""will be cresting tomorrow mid-morning. Again, that is expected to be historic level on that river"", he told CNN on Thursday evening. He warned it would take ""weeks"" to recover from the storm, and appealed for help from the federal government. An evacuation order was lifted in the Orting community south of Seattle, but Central Pierce Fire and Rescue cautioned residents to ""remain vigilant into the evening"". ""Remember, turn around don't drown,"" the department wrote on Thursday on X. More than 30 highways were closed across the state, with closures also affecting commuters in the Seattle area. The flooding has hit all of western Washington, as well as further south along the Oregon coast. Skagit County, a major agricultural area north of Seattle, issued an immediate evacuation order to residents who live on the floodplain. Some 75,000 people would be evacuated from low-lying areas, officials said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Thursday the Skagit river would cause ""severe near-record flooding from Rockport downstream through Sedro Woolley"". It warned of ""deep and swift flood waters"" especially in the Cape Horn, Hamilton and Thunderbird area. Rescues are taking place around the state, involving inflatable boats and helicopters. Seven-year-old Jocelyn Rosas choked back tears as she returned to find her home in a mobile home park underwater in Monroe, a city northeast of Seattle. ""The only clothes I've got are just my pyjamas,"" she told the BBC's US partner CBS News. Her father, Jose Rosas, said the family moved about two months ago after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. The move was intended to save money for his wife's treatment. ""It's hard because we had to explain to her why we moved over here,"" Rosas said. ""And now it's gone,"" he said of their home. The Snohomish County Sheriff's Office said in an overnight social media post that they had rescued ""multiple"" people by helicopter after they got trapped in their homes in Sultan, Washington, about 40 miles (65km) north-east of Seattle. Officials said the Snohomish River was experiencing major flooding and ""dancing with records"" as water lapped against a local flood wall. King County - which contains the city of Seattle - and Snohomish County officials have warned the road closures could last for several days. At the town of Concrete, the high water mark upstream was below estimates, but authorities have warned people that record levels elsewhere were still possible. Across the border in Canada's British Columbia, there are City officials said the Nooksack River was expected to overflow its banks, and they anticipate flooding, though not as severe as in 2021, when it caused significant damage and five deaths in the province. Most major highways to the Lower Mainland are now closed, according to the travel-information website Drive BC. The US-Canada Sumas Border Crossing is also closed to commercial traffic. The entire region, spanning parts of both the US and Canada, has received torrential rain from an atmospheric river - a phenomenon where water evaporates into the air and is carried by the wind and forms long currents that surge through the sky like rivers flow on land.

Council leader Linden Kemkaran, of Reform UK, labelled the incident a ""catastrophic failure"". Water Minister Emma Hardy said she had spoken to the CEO of South East Water (SEW) and made it clear that the disruption was unacceptable, and that the Drinking Water Inspectorate was undertaking a full investigation. Kemkaran said a government-backed recovery fund should provide '""meaningful and urgent financial relief"". ""The impact on the daily lives of our residents, local businesses, and key services such as health, education, and social care provision has been profound and has threatened the viability of our local economy,"" she said. The leader added that SEW repeatedly failed to meet its own restoration timelines as residents endured ""an experience that simply should not occur in a modern developed country"". ""Local businesses, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors, have suffered significant financial losses during what should have been their busiest trading period in the run-up to Christmas,"" she added. Kemkaran said she was worried standard compensation levels would fall short of ""While I note the government's recent strengthening of the Guaranteed Standards Scheme, this scheme was never designed to address the scale and duration of disruption experienced in this incident,"" she explained. The council leader said residents had received £50 from SEW, which had been credited into their accounts. ""Our residents, communities, and businesses should not have to foot the bill for the systemic and repeated failures by SEW, or live with the continuing risk of further outages from an organisation that has failed on more than one occasion,"" Kemkaran added. The council leader has also called on the government to ensure SEW prioritises a permanent resolution, to work with Ofwat and the Drinking Water Inspectorate to ensure an investigation is carried out, and to consider legislative or regulatory reforms. In July, the government said severe issues such as flooding would see customers given compensation up to £2,000, while households suffering consistent low water pressure will be automatically eligible to receive up to £250. Hardy said: ""Protecting water customers is my top priority. ""I have chaired a multi-agency strategic response group and insisted that every possible step be taken to restore supplies, and that bottled water stations remain available while SEW keeps all affected customers fully informed. ""This government has strengthened compensation rules, more than doubling payments so those affected are properly reimbursed for this disruption."" Tanya Sephton, SEW's customer services director, said the company was fully committed to compensating customers fairly.

2025-12-11,Reindeer farm could close over licence dispute,science,BBC,"The owner of a reindeer visitor attraction has said she fears that her business will be forced to close after the council asked her to apply for a different licence. Sarah Sutton, who has run the Somerset Reindeer Ranch for 12 years, said Somerset Council had now told her she must obtain a zoo licence or the premises would only be able to open six days a year, instead of all year. ""Reindeers are very quiet and they're very domesticated - but they're now being seen as wild animals. It's ridiculous,"" she said. Somerset Council said it understood that obtaining a zoo licence was a ""lengthy process"" and would allow this year's Christmas reindeer events to go ahead as planned. The attraction, based in Chilthorne Domer, near Yeovil, has operated under an animal exhibition licence for 12 years and runs open days for schools and reindeer meet and feed experiences. But Somerset Council said following a review of the premises it would need to apply for a zoo licence, or reduce the number of public opening days to a maximum of six, ""which would remove the need for a licence"". Following the development, Liberal Democrat MP for Glastonbury and Somerton, Sarah Dyke, has raised the issue in parliament to clarify what kind of animal licence is needed for venues with reindeers. Ms Sutton said: ""We definitely won't be able to afford to keep this reindeer herd here without the public being able to come in and support what we do. ""A zoo licence is really for a much larger organisation such as Longleat or Bristol Zoo. It's not really for us. These reindeer are basically very fancy cattle. ""We are going to be expected to keep licensed firearms for example. We'd have to completely change the infrastructure and it's not something that we feel that we would be able to do."" In raising the issue by submitting a new bill to parliament, Dyke detailed how she felt that DEFRA should exclude attractions with reindeer from having to apply for a zoo licence to operate. The MP said making reindeer farms subject to the same rules as zoos is ""nonsensical"". ""The law should be fair and classify reindeer as domesticated animals to ensure all councils right across the country are able to take exactly the same view to allow reindeer farms to continue to operate as they have for many years safely. ""The cost implications could reach up to the region of about £100,000, which is obviously not fair for a small family-run business."" Somerset Council said in a statement: ""Following a review of the premises, it will need to apply for a zoo licence, or reduce the number of public opening days to six or fewer, which would remove the need for a licence. ""Our officers confirmed with the owners that, in line with our enforcement policy, a willingness to resolve any non-compliance by applying for the correct licence would mean the council will not take any formal enforcement steps.

2025-12-11,Bid for referendum on net zero policy rejected,science,BBC,"Politicians have rejected a bid to hold a referendum on the future of the Isle of Man's net zero policy. MHK Stu Peters had called for the vote on whether the government should continue its commitment to reaching the carbon emissions target by 2050, arguing it would  ""gauge the appetite"" of people on its ""eye-watering costs"". However, Tynwald members instead backed an amendment that stated the 2026 general election would allow an opportunity for all matters - including net zero  - ""to be democratically considered."" That was put forward by Environment, Food and Agriculture Minister Clare Barber, who said that candidates would be able to set out their views on climate change during the campaign. She said that since the government's climate change fund was established in 2022, £8.5m had been spent, and 80% of that had been to improve the energy efficiency ""directly in constituents homes"" - to reduce their energy bills and consumption. a bid by Peters for the government to relax net zero emissions targets and budgets was also rejected. During the latest debate he the referendum would not be ""binding"" and argued that the amendment was a ""cop out from Government."" He argued the move would ""merely establish a reliable public mandate and reinforce government's commitment to net zero."" Supporting the idea, Julie Edge MHK argued the policies that had been decided were ""clearly not aligning with the Manx public"", and if the result was to continue with net zero, the policy should be reviewed. She added: ""There is a lot of public support for what Mr Peters is trying to achieve, so do we just carry on, or do we listen?"" However, John Wannenburgh MHK said politicians were ""duty-bound"" to reduce the amount of money on an annual basis spent off-island on fossil fuels, which had a price which ""we have no control over"", by using renewables. He argued a referendum risked delaying progress and ""oversimplifying the scale of the challenge"" MLC Gary Clueit warned the ""language that would dominate a referendum campaign"" would be that of ""conspiracy"", and ""not evidence, not economics, not energy security."" Infrastructure Minister Michelle Haywood said the matter of net zero was ""not a simple, definable issue"" and the actions being taken on the path to it were ""embedded in what we are doing across government"". Climate change was an ""internationally recognised issue,"" she said, adding: ""We are going to be forced into adopting low or zero emission technologies, mainly because we don't manufacture our own.""

2025-12-12,Geminid meteor shower set to light up sky during weekend peak,science,BBC,"The Geminid meteor shower - one of the most spectacular in the celestial calendar  - is set to peak this weekend and astronomers say conditions could make for an especially striking show if weather permits. The meteors are visible all over the world, though people in the Northern Hemisphere will get the best views. In the UK, if the skies are clear, a waning crescent Moon will only rise after midnight which should mean several hours of dark skies to see the meteors more clearly. Here's the science behind the Geminids and how to get the best chance of seeing them. We get treated to meteor showers when Earth passes through the trails of comets - icy objects which Nasa calls 'cosmic snowballs' - or in rarer cases, including the Geminids, asteroids, which are rocky. When dust and gases from these objects enter our atmosphere, they burn up and create the bright streaks we know as shooting stars. While most meteors appear white, some can glow green, yellow, red, or blue, depending on the elements in the material as it burns up in Earth's atmosphere. Metals such as sodium, magnesium, and calcium produce colours similar to those seen in fireworks. The Geminids shower comes from the remnants of an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. Until recently, scientists thought the Geminids were a result of dust escaping from 3200 Phaethon. But two years ago that Phaethon's tail is actually made of glowing sodium gas. So there is still some uncertainty about how and when the Geminids dust was formed. The Geminids offer one of the year's best chances, weather-permitting, of seeing a shower, due to the volume and frequency of its 'shooting stars'. ""What you'd be looking at in a nice dark sky without clouds would be, say, 100 an hour, which is amazing, said Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society. ""It's pretty much the strongest meteor shower of the year."" Bright moonlight can make it more difficult to see meteors and other objects in the night sky. But weather-permitting, we could have close to ideal viewing conditions as the Geminids peak. The crescent Moon is in its final waning phases, with the bulk of it in shadow, and in the UK it also won't rise until the early hours of the morning, potentially giving us a nice dark sky in which to watch the spectacle. Do keep in mind that visibility is still heavily influenced by weather conditions, so check your local forecast for the clearest possible window. Finding somewhere without light pollution and with an open view of the sky will give you the best chance of seeing something. The Geminids are a naked-eye event, best enjoyed under dark, open skies, so you won't need a telescope or binoculars. ""There aren't that many entirely free natural treats. And this is one of them. So go out and enjoy it. You know, it's a way of connecting with the sky, taking a moment to sort of forget our more earthly or more worldly concerns,"" said Dr Massey. The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation of Gemini, but looking slightly away from that point often provides a wider field of view. Dress warmly and take a blanket or reclining chair to get comfortable, and let your eyesight adapt to the dark. ""You just basically need to have reasonable eyesight to see this and I think that is incredible."" The Geminids meteor shower peaks on Sunday 14 December. Unfortunately, the weather in the UK isn't looking ideal for viewing. Both Saturday and Sunday are expected to be windy and cloudy, with outbreaks of rain during the day and night. On Sunday night, there may be a few drier, clearer spells. Northern Scotland and the Northern Isles, as well as parts of East Anglia and southeast England, are likely to have the best chances of catching a glimpse of the night sky. But keep on checking in as there may be gaps in the gloom. A good place to keep track of the potential for a good viewing in your area is",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyvkkxxj42o

""The world has lost a true conservation legend today, but his extraordinary legacy will continue,"" the charity's founder Charles Mayhew said in a statement. Born in 1942 to an aristocratic British family in Dorset, England, Douglas-Hamilton studied biology and zoology in Scotland and Oxford before moving to Tanzania to research elephant social behaviour. It was there at Lake Manyara National Park that he began documenting every elephant he encountered, eventually becoming so familiar with the herds he could recognise them by the unique shapes of their ears and wrinkles on their skin. ""The thing about elephants is that they have a lot in common with human beings,"" he said in a 2024 documentary about his work, A Life Among Elephants. Friend and fellow conservationist Jane Goodall, who died in October, was featured in the documentary, and said he had shown the world that elephants are capable of feeling just like humans. ""I think his legacy will be one of a man who did so much to help people understand how majestic, how wonderful elephants are, and to learn more about their way of life,"" Goodall said. But that work did not always come easy: he was charged at by elephants, almost killed by a swarm of bees and shot at by poachers. In 2010, a flood destroyed his research facility in Kenya and years of work was lost. Despite the hardships, Douglas-Hamilton remained steadfast in his mission to raise awareness of the plight of African elephants, becoming one of the leading voices to alert the world of the ivory poaching crisis, which he described as ""an elephant holocaust"". He later campaigned for an international ban on the commercial trade in ivory, and in 1989 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was signed, an international agreement between governments. After the agreement failed to wipe out the trade completely, Douglas-Hamilton turned his attention to China and the US, the two main markets for ivory. Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Barack Obama agreed to a near-total ban on its import and export in 2015. Douglas-Hamilton established Save the Elephants in 1993, a charity dedicated to safeguarding the animals and deepening human understanding of their behaviour. The organisation's CEO Frank Pope, who is also his son-in-law, said: ""Iain changed the future not just for elephants, but for huge numbers of people across the globe. His courage, determination and rigour inspired everyone he met."" In his own words, Douglas-Hamilton expressed optimism for the future of his life's work. ""I think my greatest hope for the future is that there will be an ethic developed of human-elephant coexistence,"" he once said. Iain Douglas-Hamilton is survived by his wife Oria, children Saba and Dudu, and six grandchildren. to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

2025-12-10,M74 reopens after lorries blown over during Storm Bram,science,BBC,"The main motorway linking Scotland and England has fully reopened after several  lorries were blown over during Storm Bram. The M74 was shut between junctions 12 and 13 near Abington in South Lanarkshire for much of the night when high winds toppled HGVs on Tuesday evening. The northbound carriageway was cleared early on Wednesday and Police Scotland said southbound traffic was also now running after a vehicle recovery operation. No-one was injured. The second named storm of the season also caused problems for rail travellers with fallen trees and damaged overhead cables,  and more than 1,000 properties lost power. Network Rail said repairs had been made to a damaged overhead cable on the  Glasgow-Neilston route and the line would reopen once an affected train had been returned to the depot. One train was struck by a trampoline that blew onto the railway line south of Perth on Tuesday evening, but it was able to continue its journey. Fallen trees and branches had to be removed from a number of lines, but it said almost all of the rail network was open. West Highland line services between Glasgow, Oban and Mallaig and services between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh were facing the biggest disruption. Some flights into Glasgow and Edinburgh were cancelled or diverted during the storm. Football fans were left disappointed when Tuesday's s KDM Evolution Trophy match between Queen of the South and Dunfermline Athletic Another five matches were also called off due to high winds and heavy rain. Roads agency Bear Scotland said its teams worked through the night clearing fallen trees that had affected the A9 at Cambusavie and the A84 south of Loch Lubnaig. Storm Bram, named by the Irish weather service Met Éireann, prompted an amber alert for much of north west Scotland. Lesser yellow alerts were issued for the rest of the country, and these will remain in place north of the central belt through much of the day. In the Highlands five schools including Gairloch High are closed and others opened later than usual. At the height of the storm, gusts of 76mph were recorded on South Uist in the Western Isles with similar speeds also felt in Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway. Some homes and businesses were left without power with showing about 1,000 customers affected by outages in various areas north of the central belt. SP Energy Networks said its engineers were also working to restore supplies to hundreds of customers in the south of the country. Large parts of Teviotdale, Tweeddale, the Leader Valley and as far north as Heriot have been affected while  there were also outages around Moffat, Lockerbie, Canonbie and Kirkcudbright. A spokesperson said: ""We have fewer than 400 customers without power this morning across the South of Scotland with those numbers coming down and are working hard to restore those affected as quickly and as safely as possible."" The storm was accompanied by heavy rain in many areas, and the has 17 flood warnings in force -  mainly in Tayside and Orkney - as well as a number of flood alerts.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d96p19j3qo
2025-12-10,"Amazon, Microsoft pledge mega AI investments in India",science,BBC,"Tech giants Amazon and Microsoft have announced a combined $52.5bn (£39.4bn) investment plan for India over the coming years. Amazon said on Wednesday it was pumping in $35bn into India by 2030 to advance AI-driven digitisation, export growth and job creation, a day after Microsoft committed $17.5bn strengthen the country's AI ecosystem. India, which is an emerging AI and cloud infrastructure hub, has witnessed a surge of global tech investments recently. announced a $15bn investment to build an AI data hub, and earlier this week Intel announced a collaboration with Mumbai-based Tata Electronics as its first major customer in the latter's $14bn semiconductor manufacturing plans. ""When it comes to AI, the world is optimistic about India,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X, after meeting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Tuesday. Amazon's $35bn investment will build on the $40bn already invested in India - establishing the company as ""the largest foreign investor"" in India, the company said in a statement. A key component of it will go into local cloud and AI infrastructure. Microsoft's fresh commitment follows a $3bn investment announced by the company earlier this year. It includes a new ""hyperscale cloud region"" - a cluster of data centres - in the southern India's Hyderabad city, set to go live in mid-2026, the company said in a statement. Data centres are centralised physical facilities that host computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment, and are a key component of the AI value chain that India is focusing on despite concerns around water shortages. India will also be given access to Microsoft's ""sovereign public cloud"", which offers tools to help organisations run their data and applications while keeping sensitive information within the country. The India investment is part of Microsoft's $23bn AI expansion across countries including Canada, Portugal and the UAE, as the company vies with rivals such as Amazon and Google. In a statement Microsoft said it also aims to integrate AI into Indian government platforms, supporting around 310 million informal workers. The announcements come as India steps up activity in semiconductor manufacturing, with several state-backed and private projects aiming to build a domestic chipmaking industry. While India is a big market for AI - with a billion internet users and a big tech talent pool - it still lags behind global leaders like China and the US. However, the country has been drawing billions in investments in key computing technologies such as chips, with the government's semiconductor mission offering generous subsidies to firms setting up chip-making facilities. India's sovereign AI model is also expected to be unveiled in February next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w79pgn8peo
2025-12-09,U-turn on environment funding cut in budget,science,BBC,"An amendment to restore a government department's funding back to current levels has been accepted. Jersey's government had initially rejected calls from the Environment, Housing and Infrastructure Scrutiny Panel for the environment department to have £11.7m of funding next year rather than the £11.1m proposed in Environment Minister Steve Luce admitted the cut would ""severely undermine service delivery across the board"" but But after changes were made, Chief Minister Lyndon Farnham said the government would accept the amendment, which States Assembly members voted 44-1 in favour of. The government will bring a budget amendment explaining how it plans to maintain the department's funding. Deputy Hilary Jeune, the scrutiny panel's chairperson, suggested lowering the budget could weaken the department along with the ""wellbeing of this island"". ""Let me be absolutely clear - this amendment does not create new growth, nor does it expand the public sector,"" Jeune said. ""It is simply about ensuring the environment department can meet the statutory duties that this assembly has already placed upon it."" Jeune's amendment initially suggested getting money from the Strategic Reserve to avoid cutting the department's funding, but this idea was dropped. Following the removal of using the Strategic Reserve to boost the department's budget, the chief minister said the government would support the amendment. Farnham explained the government would consider savings in other departments to avoid cutting the environment budget. He added: ""We have asked treasury officials to come back with an amendment that looks at growth bids and spreading the difference across the departments. ""In the scheme of things, I don't think it's a great burden and we will be pleased to support it.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8n01l70po
2025-12-10,Unusual items washing up on Sussex beaches,science,BBC,"Containers full of bananas were found on beaches across Sussex this week, but they are not the only unusual cargo to wash up on the county's shores over the years. , two at Pagham Harbour and another two at Bognor Regis. Back in March 1901 a steamship called the Indiana shipwrecked and its cargo of oranges and lemons washed up in East Worthing. Residents rushed to the beach to collect the fruits and to this day locals throw oranges and lemons on the beach to commemorate the sinking of the Indiana. In January 2008, authorities closed beaches along the south coast, including Worthing, Ferring and Hastings as well as further afield in Kent, to prevent looters stealing more than 2,000 tonnes of timber which littered the coast. , which sank about 26 miles (42km) off the coast after a storm. In November 1926, Worthing residents found a wooden crate floating in the water and when they opened the box, they discovered a dead elephant calf. In memory of the animal, named Jumbo by the town, a statue of the elephant now stands at Worthing's Splash Point. Authorities reported the street value of the haul was worth £80m. The BBC also recently reported on large quantities of biobeads being found washed up at Camber Sands. Last month, up to 10 tonnes of plastic pellets entered the sea at Eastbourne through a 3.4km (2.1 mile) pipe Back in April 1919, the people of Hastings were surprised to find a giant Meanwhile, in January 1980, the Athina B carrying 3,000 tons of pumice and heading towards Shoreham Harbour, suffered an engine failure. The ship was stuck between the Palace Pier and Banjo Groyne in Brighton. Clare Trotman, beachwatch officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said: ""Unusual items washing up on Sussex beaches could pose risks to our local marine life, especially materials like foam insulation which could break down and be ingested by wildlife."" Ms Trotman urged residents to avoid direct contact with potentially hazardous items and report them to the local council or coastguards. ""We encourage people to record what they find, including large items or anything in significant numbers, through our beach cleaning programme,"" she added. ""The data will helps us track pollution trends and push for stronger protections for our seas."" Dean Spears, from Sussex Bay, has also advised residents that any items found from containers should immediately be reported to HM Coastguard's Receiver of Wreck Service.

2025-12-09,Does Japan's megaquake warning mean the 'big one' is coming?,science,BBC,"After a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck north-eastern Japan on Monday, authorities again warned of the possibility of a future megaquake. It means that thoughts in Japan are turning to the ""big one"" - a once-in-a-century quake. In September, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough  - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - within the next 30 years. In April authorities had warned that a megaquake had the potential to trigger a tsunami of more than 20m (66ft) which could hit parts of Tokyo and other prefectures. They predicted that there would be around 300,000 deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damage. So, what is the ""big one"", can it be predicted - and is it likely to strike any time soon? Officials urged residents in seven prefectures from Hokkaido in the north to Chiba in central Japan to stay on high alert for a potential megaquake. This is a vast area with millions of people. A government official said there was a possibility that ""a large-scale earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or higher could occur as a follow-up earthquake"" in the region. Authorities also told people to check evacuation routes, secure furniture, and prepare emergency kits, including food, water and portable toilets. However, an evacuation order was not issued. Japan's director for disaster management said at a news conference that global earthquake data suggests there's a possibility, not a prediction, of a larger tremor to come. Officials said the possibility of a larger quake occurring is about one in 100. Japan is a country used to earthquakes. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year. The vast majority do little damage, but there are some - like the one which struck in 2011 measuring magnitude 9.0, sending a tsunami into the north-east coast and killing more than 18,000 people. But the one that authorities fear may strike in this more densely populated region to the south could - in the absolute worst-case scenario - be even more deadly. Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough have already been responsible for thousands of deaths. In 1707, a rupture along its entire 600km length caused the second-biggest earthquake ever recorded in Japan and was followed by the eruption of Mount Fuji. These so-called ""megathrust"" earthquakes tend to strike every hundred years or so, often in pairs: the last ones were in 1944 and 1946. And this long-anticipated event is, according to geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A Hubbard, ""the original definition of the 'Big One'”. ""The history of great earthquakes at Nankai is convincingly scary"" so as to be concerning, the pair acknowledged Not according to Robert Geller, professor emeritus of seismology at the University of Tokyo. When authorities issued a megaquake warning last year, after a 7.1 quake struck southern Japan, Prof Geller told the BBC that the warning had ""almost nothing to do with science"". The advisory was ""not a useful piece of information"", he said. This, he argued, is because while earthquakes are known to be a ""clustered phenomenon"", it is ""not possible to tell in advance whether a quake is a foreshock or an aftershock”. Indeed, only about 5% of earthquakes are ""foreshocks"", said Bradley and Hubbard. However, the 2011 earthquake was preceded by a 7.2 magnitude foreshock, they note - one which was largely ignored. The warning system was drawn up after 2011 in an attempt to prevent a disaster of this scale again. August 2024 was the first time the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) used it. But, crucially, while it told people to be prepared, it did not tell anyone to evacuate. Indeed, they were keen to play down any massive imminent risk. ""The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely occur,"" the JMA said at the time.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2en927054o

2025-12-10,How monogamous are humans? Scientists compile 'league table' of pairing up,science,BBC,"Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species. In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a ""league table"" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests. At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats. However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds. ""There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,"" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge. In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals. Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%). Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin). In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%. However, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart. ""Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,"" Dr Dyble told BBC News. ""Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units."" Dr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose. ""I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,"" he said. ""Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating."" The new study is published in the",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpvx3exglo

A Met Office amber warning for wind is in force for the Western Isles and north west Scotland until 03:00 on Wednesday, with gusts of more than 90mph possible in exposed areas. The rest of the country is covered by a series of less severe yellow weather warnings  into Wednesday, while central and southern areas have already seen heavy rain. Police said the A74(M) near Abington in Lanarkshire was closed due to overturned vehicles. Some Highland train services have been suspended and ScotRail has warned of disruption between Glasgow Central and the west coast. Network Rail said several fallen trees were affecting Scotland's railway, particularly in the west and south-west of the country. So far, winds of over 70mph have been recorded at Machrihanish in Argyll and Bute, and 69mph in South Uist in the Outer Hebrides. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has issued - including for Edinburgh, Ayrshire, Orkney and Western Isles. The agency said there were risks around coastal flooding, high water levels on rivers and surface water on roads. A number of power cuts have been reported in Argyll, Tayside and north-east Scotland. SP Energy Networks has also reported faults affecting some parts of central and southern Scotland. Storm Bram, named by the Irish weather service Met Éireann, is the second named storm of the season. which caused travel disruption and power cuts across tens of thousands of homes in Scotland. The West Highland Line between Glenfinnan and Mallaig and the line between Dingwall Junction and Kyle of Lochalsh closed as the amber warning came into force. ScotRail said services between Glasgow Central to Largs/Ardrossan Harbour will start and terminate at Kilwinning, and some to Wemyss Bay services would start and terminate at Port Glasgow. It said services were unable to run between Ayr and Stranraer. Network Rail said a fallen tree had caused ""significant damage"" to overhead wires near Whitecraigs on the Glasgow Central to Neilston line.

2025-12-10,People rescued from flooding as Storm Bram hits,science,BBC,"More than four people have been rescued from their stranded vehicles as floods caused by Storm Bram hit road and rail travel across Devon and Cornwall. Fire services said two people were helped from the roof of their car in Teigngrace, Devon, two people were rescued near Whitford, Devon and there were ""several"" more rescues from vehicles in Cornwall. The road through Weare Giffard in north Devon has been closed due to flooding. Train services towards Plymouth were affected by flooding in a tunnel between Totnes and Ivybridge, which was later cleared. BBC South West's senior broadcast meteorologist David Braine said Dartmoor had seen more than 100mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours. Houses in Warland Road, Totnes, were flooded as the River Dart, which carries water from Dartmoor, was swollen by rainwater. Resident Karen said: ""It was like a river, we have got a step but it still came in because it came so high."" Helen Swan said nearby Shute Road was ""full of water, so you'd think twice about driving through it"", although it had now subsided. She understands that the flooding was caused by blocked drains. Braine said: ""Dartmoor so far in December has received 267mm of rain."" The forecaster said Plymouth had also received its normal monthly rainfall for December - 125mm - in the first eight days of this month. The Environment Agency said between 10:00 GMT on Monday and 10:00 Tuesday, there had been 106mm of rainfall at White Barrow, 87mm in Princetown, 82mm in Dartmoor, 72mm in Bovey Tracey, 56mm in Tavistock and 51mm in Liskeard. Part of the West Hoe Pier in Plymouth collapsed as huge waves battered the waterfront. The arm of the eastern pier had been undergoing strengthening work when ""ferocious weather and sea conditions caused the outer wall to cave in"", said the city council. Contractors would investigate the full extent of the damage on Wednesday said the council and come up with a plan to ""instigate urgent repairs as soon as possible"". Richard Brasset, 60, who lives by the River Fowey in Lostwithiel, Cornwall, said he was ""tremendously worried"" and a lot of cars were ""completely flooded"" and ""underwater"". He said: ""High tide was roughly 08:30 this morning and it's 11:30 and it hasn't gone down at all. ""The wind is preventing the water going out and obviously we're going to have another tide this evening coming in. ""I'm fully expecting it to be flooded by this evening which is a tremendous worry."" He said his home had flooded four times since 2009. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said by 10:00 crews had attended nine incidents involving the public getting stuck in floodwater or ""arching power lines"". The service added: ""Every year people lose their lives when their vehicles enter the water, some of those occur during periods of flooding when water encroaches on to normally well drained carriageways or when normally benign river crossings (fords) become raging torrents. ""We would advise people to consider whether their journey is essential due to the amount of standing water and debris on some roads."" Devon and Cornwall Police's road policing team said: ""Give extra time and space. It's horrid out, with poor visibility from spray and surface water."" Penzance Council also advised people to take care when driving as there was a lot of surface water and debris on the roads. BBC South West broadcast meteorologist Bee Tucker said heavy rain and strong winds had battered the region on Monday evening through to Tuesday. She said: ""Gusts of 50-60mph are likely throughout the day, with the south coast of Devon, Cornwall and the Isle of Scilly bearing the brunt of the winds."" On Monday, a danger to life warning was issued by the Met Office as the across the UK but all weather warnings for Devon and Cornwall have now ceased. Great Western Railway said due to flooding between Par and Newquay, the line was closed and train services running to and from these stations were cancelled. It said urged passengers to check services before travelling adding: ""Disruption is expected until the end of the day."" Devon County Council urged everyone to ""please take care, expect fallen trees, debris and flooding, especially near rivers and the coast"" in the ""difficult travel conditions"". Jen Murphy, from the council's highways control team, urged people to not drive through the floodwater: ""A lot of it's fast flowing so there's no way of knowing how deep it is or what sort of debris might be in it. ""We urge people to take care in places like that where roads are close to rivers and think about their routes and plan their routes.""

2025-12-10,Campaigners fail in latest bid to block incinerator,science,BBC,"Environmental campaigners have failed to convince a council to undermine a government-approved waste-to-energy incinerator project. The protesters wanted Wiltshire Council to drop a contract with the Hills Group, a key shareholder in Northacre Renewable Energy Ltd (NREL), to make its planned incinerator in Westbury, Wiltshire, less financially viable. However, the council has decided against such a move, saying it would cost almost £20m and lead to non-recyclable rubbish incurring ""waste miles"" en route to incinerators elsewhere in the UK or Europe. Those against the incinerator say it is being built too close to housing and will harm air quality. Permission for the site was granted by the government's planning inspectorate in 2023, after years of protests from councils and residents. Construction work began on the project in early November. But campaigners believed that if the Hills Group lost one of its major contracts in the area it would abandon the project. At a meeting on Tuesday, Wiltshire Council decided to keep the contract. A spokesman said the facility was not being built as a direct result of any contract between the Hills Group and the council. It said the project is instead a commercial enterprise between Qair Group, which owns a 90% stake in NREL, and the Hills Group. The council spokesman explained that it has an agreement with the Hills Group to use its existing mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plant, which is on the same site as the incinerator, until 2038. The Hills Group said 60,000 tonnes of Wiltshire's household waste is processed at the Northacre Resource Recovery Centre. This is carried out using mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) to create solid recovered fuel (SRF) for use in renewable energy plants. Paul Sample, from Wiltshire Council, said it can not dictate what Hills Group does with the waste once sorted. He said it would be ""sensible"" for the council's non-recyclable waste to be treated locally where it can be used to generate energy. The alternative is for the waste to incur additional miles being transported to other incineration facilities, he said. Mark Bailey, deputy mayor of Westbury and chairman of Westbury Town Council's incinerator monitoring group, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" at the council's decision. ""There are other, greener options for dealing with waste and for producing energy,"" he said. NREL previously said the incinerator would reduce the levels of waste being sent to landfill in Wiltshire and therefore reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2024 BBC investigation found that was being burned to make electricity, and that this had become the country's most polluting method of generating power.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg91n4lp8jo
2025-12-10,Heathrow plan 'will impact air quality progress',science,BBC,"A London City Hall committee has warned that Heathrow Airport's expansion plans would undermine progress made to the capital's air quality and expose residents to ""harmful"" levels of noise, in a letter to the government. , which could increase the annual number of flights from 480,000 to 756,000. In its letter to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, the cross-party group – with the exception of Reform UK Assembly Member Keith Prince – said the impact of aircraft noise from London's multiple airports was ""already too great."" The government said any airport expansion ""must be in line with environmental targets"". Last month, ministers selected a proposal by Heathrow Airport for a new 3.5 km (2.2 miles) long runway and an underground road tunnel, which would require relocating the M25 motorway. In its letter, the Environment Committee said it believed the expansion could undermine progress made in London on air quality and goes against both local and national climate targets. The group also referred to Ms Alexander's previous opposition to the expansion when she was London's deputy mayor for transport. It has asked the transport secretary to set out how its four ""tests"" for the expansion – air quality, climate impacts, noise levels and adequate consultation of Londoners – would be measured before pushing on with the plans. The committee also recommended that the government consider ""caps on overall flight numbers"" to keep down carbon emissions. In October, Christina Calderato, director of strategy at Transport for London, told the Environment Committee a third runway would undo the recent improvement in air quality in the capital. ""We have a number of serious concerns around noise, carbon emissions and air quality – we've done a lot in London to improve air quality, and we don't want to see those gains used as headroom for the Heathrow expansion,"" she said. Committee chair Leonie Cooper, a Labour Assembly Member, added: ""The proposed expansion for Heathrow Airport raises a number of serious environmental concerns. ""Experts highlighted the risk that an expansion could reverse the recent improvements to air quality through schemes such as the Ulez."" She said the government should ""ensure appropriate tests are in place to monitor the impact on London's air quality, on noise and for targets for no additional air quality impacts from airports"". A spokesperson for the mayor of London told the Sadiq Khan remains opposed to a third runway at Heathrow Airport. It added that he was ""unconvinced that a new Heathrow runway can deliver hundreds of thousands of additional flights every year without a hugely detrimental impact on our environment"". A Department for Transport spokesperson told the LDRS any airport expansion had to be ""in line with environmental targets"" and it was ""reviewing the Airports National Policy Statement to ensure its four tests on climate, air quality, noise and economic growth are met. , would make flights ""quicker, quieter, and cleaner.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gew5l8kkzo
2025-12-11,Shell facing first UK legal claim over climate impacts of fossil fuels,science,BBC,"Victims of a deadly typhoon in the Philippines have filed a legal claim against oil and gas company Shell in the UK courts, seeking compensation for what they say is the company's role in making the storm more severe. Around 400 people were killed and millions of homes hit when Typhoon Rai slammed into parts of the Philippines just before Christmas in 2021. Now a group of survivors are for the first time taking legal action against the UK's largest oil company, arguing that it had a role in making the typhoon more likely and more damaging. Shell says the claim is ""baseless"", as is a suggestion the company had unique knowledge that carbon emissions drove climate change. Typhoon Rai, known locally as Odette, was the most powerful storm to hit the Philippines in 2021. With winds gusting at up to 170mph (270km/h), it destroyed around 2,000 buildings, displaced hundreds of thousands of people - including Trixy Elle and her family. She was a fish vendor on Batasan island when the storm hit, forcing her from her home, barely escaping with her life. ""So we have to swim in the middle of big waves, heavy rains, strong winds,"" she told BBC News from the Philippines. ""That's why my father said that we will hold our hands together, if we survive, we survive, but if we will die, we will die together."" Trixy is now part of the group of 103 individuals that has filed a claim that's believed to be the first case of its kind against a UK major producer of oil and gas. In a letter sent to Shell before the claim was filed at court, the legal team for the survivors says the case is being brought before the UK courts as that is where Shell is domiciled – but that it will apply the law of the Philippines as that is where the damage occurred. The letter argues that Shell is responsible for 2% of historical global greenhouse gases, as calculated by the Carbon Majors The company has ""materially contributed"" to human driven climate change, the letter says, that made the Typhoon more likely and more severe. The survivors' group further claims that Shell has a ""history of climate misinformation,"" and has known since 1965 that fossil fuels were the primary cause of climate change. ""Instead of changing their industry, they still do their business,"" said Trixy Elle. ""It's very clear that they choose profit over the people. They choose money over the planet."" Shell denies that their production of oil and gas contributed to this individual typhoon, and they also deny any unique knowledge of climate change that they kept to themselves. ""This is a baseless claim, and it will not help tackle climate change or reduce emissions,"" a Shell spokesperson said in a statement to BBC News. ""The suggestion that Shell had unique knowledge about climate change is simply not true. The issue and how to tackle it has been part of public discussion and scientific research for many decades."" The case is being supported by several environmental campaign groups who argue that developments in science make it now far easier to attribute individual extreme weather events to climate change and allows researchers to say how much of an influence emissions of warming gases had on a heatwave or storm. But proving, to the satisfaction of a court, that damages done to individuals by extreme weather events are due to the actions of specific fossil fuel producers may be a challenge. ""It's traditionally a high bar, but both the science and the law have lowered that bar significantly in recent years,"" says Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate law and litigation who is not connected with the case. ""This is certainly a test case, but it's not the first case of its kind. So this will be the first time that UK courts will be satisfying themselves about the nature of all of that attribution science from a factual perspective."" The experience in other jurisdictions is mixed. In recent years efforts to bring cases against major oil and gas producers in the United States have often failed. In Europe campaigners in the Netherlands won a major case against Shell in 2021 with the courts ordering Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, including those emissions that come from the use of its products. But that ruling was overturned on appeal last year. There was no legal basis for a specific cuts target, the court ruled, but it also reaffirmed Shell's duty to mitigate dangerous climate change through its policies. The UK claim has now been filed at the Royal Courts of Justice, but this is just the first step in the case brought by the Filippino survivors with more detailed particulars expected by the middle of next year. to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

2025-12-09,Dozens injured after magnitude 7.5 quake strikes northern Japan,science,BBC,"At least 30 people were injured after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit north-eastern Japan on Monday night, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes. The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen. Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result. Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports. Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: ""Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking."" Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency. The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast. The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said. ""We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,"" he added. Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said. None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency. Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011. That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map. Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year. Earlier this year, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios suggesting it would cause trillions in damage, and potentially kill hundreds of thousands. Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - have already been responsible for thousands of deaths.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7091k5pg31o

Earlier this year the zoo transported four of the pigeons to the Gerald Durrell Endemic Wildlife Sanctuary in Mauritius. Durrell's Curator of Birds Harri Whitford chaperoned the birds on their travels, feeding them in transit and helping them to settle into their quarantine facility. The charity said thanks to captive breeding, releases and habitat restoration, pink pigeon numbers had increased from 10 to an estimated 600 birds over the past 40 years. Mr Whitford said: ""As zoos are now holding pink pigeons who carry such precious genes, it's vital we continue our efforts in breeding and returning the birds.

Fast-flowing or deep floodwater is also possible, which the Met Office said could cause a ""danger to life"", alongside delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Discussing the UK's upcoming weather picture, Met Office's deputy chief meteorologist Steven Keates said the exact track, depth and timings of the low-pressure system were ""uncertain"". He added this made it ""harder to determine where will be most impacted by strong winds and/or heavy rain"".

2025-12-07,Discharges to be checked after stream turns white,science,BBC,"Data from a china clay mining company is to be reviewed by the Environment Agency after a stream near Truro turned milky white. The stream in Coombe is a contributory to the River Fal and after heavy rainfall on Friday turned from brown to white and opaque overnight. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency (EA) said they thought the discolouration was ""linked to water from the Imerys china clay operations"". An Imerys spokesperson said the mining company was investigating the issue ""the source of which is currently unconfirmed"" and it ""remained committed to working openly with the Environment Agency"". The EA spokesperson said Imerys had a permit for emergency releases of water within 48 hours of heavy rain to protect its infrastructure and the agency would investigate the discharge monitoring data to check compliance with the conditions of that permit. They said: ""We permit their releases of water from their operations, and these discharges are closely monitored for suspended solids – such as the china clay visible at Coombe."" ""We will be investigating the discharge monitoring data associated with this rainfall event next week with Imerys to check compliance with their permit conditions,"" the spokesperson added. Imerys extracts and processes about one million tonnes of china clay (kaolin) each year at more than 20 sites across Cornwall for use in a variety of products including ceramics, paints, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The sites include a research and development centre at Par Moor and the Melbur kaolin open pit mine which lies between Ladock, St Enoder and St Stephen-in-Brannel.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w71w4kgrro

From Christmas Day, waste and recycling collections will pause and move by two working days in Swindon, with collections resuming on 29 December. Swindon Borough Council said collections will restart with those whose usual collection would have been Christmas Day, and those whose usual collection falls on Boxing day having their collection on 30 December. Councillor Chris Watts said: ""Last year's change to waste and recycling collection days worked extremely well, and helped us maintain a reliable service during one of the busiest times of the year."" Mr Watts said the change means waste crews ""can continue to avoid the Christmas backlog that used to affect around 40,000 households"". He added that the authority sees the most recyclable material wrongly put into black bins around Christmas time, and urged residents to recycle everything they can. He said: ""Every year, £2m worth of residents' money is spent disposing of recyclable material that is incorrectly put in the black bin – money that could be spent on essential services."" The change means residents should put out their bins two workings days later than usual, but every household will receive a note on their bins with more details. For those whose waste and recycling bins are collected on different days, both services will move by two days. People who use blue bags, or receive assisted collections, will be sent a postcard reminder by the council.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedx27e9619o

Irie Perera was visiting Colombo for a family wedding but says she has since sheltered about 25 people at her home in Gampola in the central province. The 61-year-old, who lives in Southend-on-Sea, said her fellow Sri Lankans were ""really, really suffering"" without water, food, clothes and medicines. ""People have lost their houses, their livelihood, and everything, beds, mattresses, computers, everything's covered in three feet of mud,"" said Ms Perera. ""Initially, it was floods. The floods have come and gone, but the hills are all soaked with water. So, now there are threats of landslides and people have to leave their homes. ""They've lived there for generations. ""Their families, they farm there, they have got their livelihoods there. They've left all these things and [gone to] get some shelter."" Speaking to presenter Akylah Rodriguez on BBC Essex, Ms Perera described receiving a knock at about midnight at her home - which she has converted into a hotel - when the cyclone hit. ""We gave them tea, coffee and they were so desperate because they just ran off when the water came."" To add to the problems, she said a lot of the locals were tea plantation workers and are unable to work. ""They don't get paid and they have no money to buy stuff. So, we were thinking of delivering a two-week pack for them until hopefully things will settle down."" She said cyclones pass by the island often, but the scale of things this time around was a surprise. ""It was totally unexpected. I have lived in that town all my life and for the last 50-60 years we have never seen flooding like this before. This is completely new."" She recalled the severe flooding in 1947, when the country was a more rural landscape with a smaller population ""Now, all those places are built up and the town has expanded, but then this is the result of that. When you build on preserve land, preservation land, this is another consequence,"" she added. The Sri Lankan government has issued an appeal for international aid and urged expats abroad to donate money to support affected communities. Ms Perera says she is part of a charity called Hela Sarana, which is providing emergency supplies.

The contractor is being contacted for comment. Dry recycling includes paper, cardboard, plastic, metal and glass. The Independent-led council said it had two waste contractors - one collected the waste and handed over to the other contractor, who processed it. There was no issue with the contractor who handled collection, the authority said. Speaking to BBC Three Counties Radio, Zerny said the processing contractor had ""told the council with extremely short notice that they wish to more than double the price that they charge for this service"".

2025-12-08,UK's first offshore wind farm marks milestone,science,BBC,"The ""critical role"" played by the UK's first offshore wind farm has been celebrated 25 years after it was built. The first turbines were erected at the site in Blyth, Northumberland, in December 2000, with the sector having since become the second largest power source in the country after gas. Energy minister Michael Shanks marked the milestone with a visit to the site and said offshore wind was the ""backbone"" of the UK's clean energy system. ""I don't think anyone could've fully appreciated the critical role that offshore wind would play in the future,"" he said. He added switching on the first turbines at Blyth had marked a ""hugely important moment"", putting the UK at the forefront of offshore energy.

2025-12-07,£4.2m food waste collection scheme to be rolled out,science,BBC,"Food waste collections are to be rolled out in the Plymouth area from March next year. It means that instead of putting food items in their brown bins, residents will be provided with a separate food waste caddy. The service, costing £4.2m to implement over the next few years, is expected to create an uplift in the city's under performing recycling rate by up to 8%. Plymouth City Council's cabinet will be asked to approve the business case for the roll out at its meeting on Monday. Households in parts of Devonport, Plympton, Plymstock, Southway, Stoke and Whitleigh will be the first to have the collections. The council said the service would eventually serve every household in Plymouth, bringing the city in line with most other local authorities in the UK. Setting up costs have been met by a combination of the council's revenue reserves, borrowing and grant funding from Defra. The setting up process has included 10 new vehicles, food waste containers, increased staffing and an infrastructure upgrade of the Prince Rock depot. Councillor Tom Briars-Delve, cabinet member for the environment and climate change, said: ""We've been working really hard to get our food waste recycling service mobilised and it's exciting to get to this stage of the process. ""We know many people in Plymouth are keen for us to get going with it and we also know that some households will want more information about how it will work in practice – and we will be providing lots of information and advice in the run up to them starting next year."" The roll out of the bins will be split into five phases, with the first beginning in March 2026 and other phases following in July, August, September and November.

2025-12-09,"UN environment report 'hijacked' by US and others over fossil fuels, top scientist says",science,BBC,"A key UN report on the state of the global environment has been ""hijacked"" by the United States and other countries who were unwilling to go along with the scientific findings, the co-chair has told the BBC. The Global Environment Outlook, the result of six years' work, connects climate change, nature loss and pollution to unsustainable consumption by people living in wealthy and emerging economies. It warns of a ""dire future"" for millions unless there's a rapid move away from coal, oil and gas and fossil fuel subsidies. But at a meeting with government representatives to agree the findings, the US and allies said they could not go along with a summary of the report's conclusions. As the scientists were unwilling to water down or change their findings, the report has now been published without the summary and without the support of governments, weakening its impact. Researchers say the objections to this new report reflect similar concerns expressed by countries at the recent COP30 talks. The BBC has approached the relevant US government departments for comment. Issued every six or seven years, the Global Environment Outlook is a significant scientific analysis of the major threats to the planet. Developed under the auspices of the UN, the normal practice for studies like this is to have the key conclusions and recommendations agreed word by word with governments and published as a ""summary for policymakers"". These summaries are seen as critical because they show that governments agree with the science and are prepared to put the findings into action. But this new version of the Global Environment Outlook does not have this type of summary, as the authors and the political representatives of around 70 countries could not agree one at a ""stormy"" meeting in Nairobi in October. Compiled by nearly 300 scientists worldwide, the report argues that the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the energy we consume all involve the extraction of resources in a highly unsustainable manner. To solve the connected issues of climate change, pollution, nature and biodiversity loss, the report has many recommendations including a rapid move away from coal, oil and gas and a massive reduction in subsidies for farming and fossil fuels. The authors acknowledge this type of action will drive-up prices for consumers. But that short term pain will bring long term economic benefits for the whole world, the report says. These strong measures, especially on fossil fuels and plastics, were too much for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia among others at the approval meeting, which usually work by consensus. ""A small number of countries basically just hijacked the process, to be quite honest,"" Prof Sir Robert Watson told BBC News. ""The US decided not to attend the meeting at all. At the very end they joined by teleconference and basically made a statement that they could not agree with most of the report, which means they didn't agree with anything we said on climate change, biodiversity, fossil fuels, plastics and subsidies."" Sir Robert is one of the world's most respected scientific voices. He's a former chief scientist for the UK's department of the environment and has also been chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as working for the World Bank and Nasa. However he has had rows with the US in the past, criticising their decision to leave an earlier climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, when he was head of the IPCC. He was ousted from that role in 2002 after lobbying by the administration of President George W. Bush. Others present at the meeting agreed that the actions of the US and other countries ""derailed"" the process. ""I thought we had gone beyond the point of recognizing that when you burn oil, this big, thick black stuff comes up, and it probably isn't good, especially when you try and breathe it in,"" said Dr David Broadstock, with the Lantau Group, and one of the report's lead authors. ""It's kind of pretty obvious, and yet we're still seeing parties wanting to pursue the increasing scale of production of such things,"" he told BBC News. Since taking office President Trump has sought to boost fossil fuel production and roll back US commitments to fight climate change, calling for the country to be a global energy superpower with cheap and reliable resources. He has also sought to get the US courts to overturn the idea that carbon dioxide is a danger to public health.  His government has also followed up with efforts to restrict or limit the efforts of international bodies that set out to tackle warming. to strike out language that states that climate change is a major issue requiring the world to move away rapidly from fossil fuels. The disagreement over the Global Environment Outlook report will raise concerns about future negotiations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports as these studies are seen as the bedrock of global efforts to limit global warming.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w9ge93w9po
2025-12-09,Trump unveils $12bn farm aid package to help farmers who faced 'unjustified trade actions',science,BBC,"US President Donald Trump has unveiled a $12bn (£9bn) farm aid package aimed at helping farmers impacted by low crop prices and the administration's ongoing trade wars. Most of the money – $11bn – is earmarked for one-time payments to farmers for row crops as part of the agriculture department's Farmer Bridge Assistance programme, with another billion reserved for crops not covered by the programme. While farmers have broadly supported Trump, the agriculture sector has been disrupted by trade disputes during his second term, particularly with China. Also on Monday, Trump threatened to hit Mexico with an additional 5% tariff in a row over water supplies to US farmers. The White House says the aid package will help farmers suffering from ""years of unjustified trade actions"" and accumulated inflation. Trump made the announcement during an event at the White House, alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. Members of Congress and corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, rice, cattle, wheat and potato farmers were also in attendance. ""Maximising domestic farm production is a big part of how we will make America affordable again and bring down grocery prices,"" Trump said. Sorghum and soybean farmers have been hit hard by the Trump administration's trade dispute with China, the greatest importer of their crops. According to a White House official, the payments are intended to help farmers market this year's harvest and plan for next year's crops, as well as act as a bridge until the administration's policies ""deliver a better market environment"". Rollins said the last $1bn would be held back to help officials understand the state of ""specialty crops"" and ensure that the government is ""making every forward moving position that we need to"". When asked if further farm aid packages were planned, Trump said ""it depends"" on how the market develops. ""The farmers don't want aid,"" he said. ""They want to have a level playing field."" The announcement comes as polls suggest Americans are increasingly concerned about rising costs - an issue which Trump has at times characterised as a ""hoax"" and a ""con job"" perpetrated by Democrats. It also followed complaints from US farmers after they lost access to customers in China as a result of Trump's trade policies. For example, China is the world's biggest market for soybeans and has in recent decades been a major buyer from the US. But Beijing effectively shut the door on American soybean imports for months after Trump hit Chinese goods with new levies earlier this year. Later on Monday, Trump threatened to impose a new 5% tariff on Mexico, accusing it of violating an agreement that gives American farmers access to water. ""It is very unfair to our US Farmers who deserve this much needed water,"" he posted on social media. Trump was referring to a more than 80-year-old treaty that grants the US water from Rio Grande tributaries. For decades the US has accused Mexico of not meeting the terms of the agreement. Mark Legan, a livestock, corn and soybean farmer in Putnam County, Indiana, told the BBC that the government aid would ""help our bottom line"" As crop prices have fallen and profitability has plummeted, he could use the funds to help replace tractors and other machinery - investments he has put on hold. During his first administration, Trump also provided aid packages to farmers, including $22bn in 2019 and another $46bn in a 2020 package that also included relief from the Covid pandemic. Mr Legan said he believed the new package would be similar to what he received during the first Trump term, in that it would not resolve persistent cost pressures and shrinking export markets, he said. ""The problem is still that we have high costs of production,"" Mr Legan said, pointing to record high prices for crop protection chemicals and seeds. ""While some markets have opened up, we're still not back to exporting as much ag products as we have in the past,"" he added. Another Illinois farmer, Brad Smith, heard news of the $12bn package while at the Illinois Farm Bureau State Convention in Chicago. ""None of us really love it, but we're not in a position where we can be turning it down,"" he said. ""We hope we can reduce the need for anything like this going forward."" If he does receive funds from the government, the money will likely be in his hands for three days, he said, before spending it to clear outstanding bills and hopefully buy seeds, chemicals and fertilisers for next year's crop. Mr Smith said that distributing government aid to farmers who need it the most, rather than to larger farms, has been a challenge in the past. Following an October meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, the White House said China had committed to buying at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans by the end of 2025, followed by 25 million metric tonnes annually for the next three years. So far, China has only purchased approximately one-quarter of that amount. Those purchases, however, have accelerated, and Bessent told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that China is likely to meet the goal by the end of February. Asked why a farm aid package was necessary, Bessent said ""the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations"". ""We are going to create this bridge because... agriculture is all about the future,"" he said. ""You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good."" On Saturday, he signed an executive order creating food supply chain security ""task forces"" and assessing ""anti-competitive behaviour"" in the agricultural sector.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrj58qed2wo
2025-12-08,White storks back in London after 600-year absence,science,BBC,"A breeding colony of white storks will be re-introduced to London for the first time in 600 years as part of a rewilding project. The native birds, which were driven to extinction in Britain in the 1400s, will be located in Eastbrookend Country Park in Dagenham from October next year, making the site the second publicly accessible white stork reintroduction project in the country. Beavers will also be released at the park in March 2027. at a nature reserve in Greenford, Ealing. The new project in east London received £500,000 from the mayor of London's Green Roots Fund, Barking and Dagenham Council and the London Wildlife Trust. Sam Davenport, director of nature recovery at London Wildlife Trust said he hoped the reintroduction of white storks and beavers could inspire an ""ambitious future for nature recovery in the capital"". Leader of Barking and Dagenham Council, Dominic Twomey, said the reintroduction of white storks in London built on Sir Sadiq Khan's Green Roots Fund will see a £12m investment over the next three years in projects that aim to make London greener, healthier and more climate resilient. ""Access to nature is an issue of social justice and it can't just be those who live in the countryside who get to share their home with our amazing wild creatures,"" Sir Sadiq said.

2025-12-07,'Our home looks apocalyptic after hurricane',science,BBC,"A British family who relocated to Jamaica have begun rebuilding their lives after Hurricane Melissa destroyed their home and business. Sabrina Morgan-Mitchell, 45, from Bristol, moved to Robins River in the south-west region of Jamaica two years ago with her husband, Dwight, and their three young children. Their 100-year-old house's doors and windows were ripped off in the storm's 298km/h (185 mph) winds and many of their possessions are ruined. To help them recover, family and friends have launched a fundraiser. Mrs Morgan-Mitchell, said: ""I have never been so frightened. The roar of a hurricane sounded like a devil."" After the hurricane warning was issued, the family moved to a small room underneath their house, staying in a closet with a mattress for hours. Mrs Morgan-Mitchell said the family prayed and read Psalms, which helped calm her children. After leaving the shelter, she said: ""My eight-year-old dropped to his knees screaming and crying, saying 'mummy the house is terrorised', we lost everything."" She added the destruction left by the hurricane looked apocalyptic. Their family business hiring out agricultural machines has also been impacted as equipment was destroyed in the storm. The hurricane made landfall on 28 October as a category five storm in Jamaica, where About 1.5 million people have been affected by the incident - more than half of the country's population. Mrs Morgan-Mitchell said they still wake up in disbelief about what they went through. ""We've just got to be grateful for life, because a lot of people lost their lives,"" she said. The family have received help from relatives abroad and were given care packages from charity organisations. They have also begun rebuilding their business, and their children are set to return to school next week after nearly a month off Rachel, who lives in Bristol, is ""like a sister"" to Mrs Morgan-Mitchell and a friend of the family. She said: ""Having been there so many times, it's hard to reconcile what it's like now. The house is 100 years old. It's gone, it's unbelievable."" She set up a GoFundMe page to help the family rebuild their lives, and is organising a fundraiser for the family in the Jamaica Club in Gloucester this month.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglgrz054g7o
2025-12-05,Bear undergoes procedure to help with fertility,science,BBC,"A female sun bear underwent a rare and unusual veterinary procedure to help protect the future of her species at Hertfordshire Zoo. Kyra has not been able to conceive with her mate, Indera, despite living with him at the site since April 2023. Last month, veterinarians discovered cysts in her womb, which they believed were the cause of her fertility issues. On Wednesday, specialist doctors travelled from Germany to remove the cysts at the zoo in Broxbourne. The sun bear is part of a crucial European conservation breeding programme. Tyler Whitnall, managing director at the zoo, said: ""This is a complex and unusual procedure, but one that is vital for Kyra and for the international breeding programme. ""If this operation is successful, it offers a real chance to boost the European population and contribute directly to the survival of this incredible species."" Sun bears are classified as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, with fewer than 10,000 remaining in the wild. They are the smallest of all bear species, native to dense forests in south-east Asia, and are recognisable for their bright, golden-patched chests.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg94w1g2r7o
2025-12-06,How 'citizen scientists' helped red squirrels return to Aberdeen,science,BBC,"Back in 2009, red squirrels were thin on the ground in Aberdeen - instead grey squirrels were a common sight in the city's trees and parks. Today the red squirrel population is thriving thanks to the efforts of a group of volunteers and their ""citizen science"". have been almost eradicated locally - and there is now evidence of red squirrel activity yards from the city's main thoroughfare. The turnaround is seen as a huge achievement for Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels (SSRS) - a partnership project led by Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) - which has been working to save the species for the past 16 years. Its north east community co-ordination and outreach officer is former primary school teacher Naomi Bentley, who has dreamed of working in conservation since childhood. She said there were currently more than 30 volunteers collecting data in the Aberdeen area, ranging from children to the retired. Thanks to their work, she said they were getting close to ""full eradication"" of the non-native species from the city, while the reds are ""thriving"". ""I think we are down to the last couple of greys,"" she added. ""It's down to the volunteers that we have so much coverage,"" Naomi said. ""It's people's love of nature - citizen science."" Originally from North America, the larger grey squirrel out-competes red squirrels for food and habitat. Some carry - but are not affected by - a pox, which is lethal to red squirrels. Grey squirrels not only replace reds they can also cause damage to woodlands by stripping bark. As the reds were lost from Aberdeen, concerns had grown they could be wiped out. After the project began in 2009, it took about two years for the first confirmed recording of a red in the city, indicating just how few were still about. Live-trapping and humane lethal control carried out by trained SSRS staff has reduced the number of greys, allowing the native reds to continue to recover. It is thought that without the project the red population in Aberdeen could have disappeared, and greys would have expanded in the north east. One of the methods used to survey populations is to set up feeder boxes with sticky tape or pads used to collect hair samples from animals entering the box. Data seen by BBC Scotland News shows that that were no confirmed grey squirrel samples feeder boxes - placed in areas such as woodland trees - in Aberdeen in the quarter of the year between 1 July and 30 September. There have also been none so far in the latest quarter, and just a handful of sightings. In contrast, there were 1,540 confirmed red squirrel samples in the July to September window, and more than 900 so far since October. Mapping of data between 2021 and 2024 also shows a strengthening of the red population, with greys almost disappearing. A box off Aberdeen's main city centre throughfare of Union Street recently had red squirrel hairs on it for the first time. Joel Sangster, 23, has been volunteering on and off for two years. He studied conservation, and saw it as a ""great opportunity"". Joel said: ""I fell in love with it, it's fantastic. ""Folk stop and talk to you and when you tell them what you're doing they are over the moon."" Another volunteer, Seshadri, goes out with his daughters Vani, 15, and eight-year-old Avni, to survey seven boxes in the local area. He said it was not glamorous work, dealing with slugs, snails, ""random insects"", wood lice, and giving the feeder boxes a good scrub but it is worth the effort. ""It's about being in touch with nature, and restoring nature as it once was,"" he said. ""We see a lot more red squirrels now."" He added: ""There are a lot of jokes and laughs and camaraderie."" Vani explained: ""I wanted to do volunteering for my bronze Duke of Edinburgh award, saw Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels, and have carried on."" And young Avni - who her dad described as ""my little helper"" - said she got involved as ""I was just curious"". The team in Aberdeen now hopes that, thanks to their efforts, the red squirrels are back for good.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg43e7r274po
2025-12-06,New suspected case of bluetongue virus discovered,science,BBC,"A new suspected case of bluetongue virus (BTV) has been discovered on a farm near Greyabbey in County Down, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) has said. Vets are investigating a suspect case of the virus in a cow which sits in the existing ) around a holding near Bangor where the  virus As a result, a second 20km TCZ is being introduced around the Greyabbey farm and is effective from 18:00 GMT on Saturday. Spread by midges, bluetongue poses no threat to the public or food safety but can affect cloven-hoofed animals like sheep and cattle. Daera veterinary officer Ignatius McKeown said it was ""difficult to say at this stage"" how many cases of bluetongue will be found. ""Certainly that second case of bluetongue has extended our surveillance area so we will be carrying out investigations throughout the area,"" Mr McKeown said. He encouraged farmers to be ""vigilant"" and ""aware of the signs of bluetongue"". ""Swollen face, a fever, lameness, drooling and crusting of the nostrils - if you do come across any of those clinical signs ring the department immediately and we will investigate."" Daera Minister Andrew Muir said the emergence of the suspect case in the existing TCZ was ""very disappointing - especially for the farmer concerned"". He described the introduction of a second TCZ as an ""essential measure"". ""This suspect case serves as another reminder of why farmers need to be extra vigilant for clinical signs of bluetongue in their flocks or herds. ""As vets continue their investigations, I and my officials will continue to work closely with stakeholders in the agri-food industry, as well as our counterparts in the Irish, UK Scottish and Welsh Governments as we respond to a rapidly evolving situation,"" Muir said. Chief Veterinary Officer Brian Dooher added: ""Bluetongue is an unpredictable virus that is spread by midges through and between flocks and herds. ""The spread of bluetongue has a significant impact on livestock, the agri-food sector and the rural economy. ""I would urge everyone in the farming industry to continue to play their part in protecting our farms by remaining vigilant and would especially urge those in the TCZs to follow the restrictions,"" Mr Dooher said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agriculture spokesperson Robbie Butler said the suspected case ""reinforces the scale and urgency of the challenge we now face"". ""It is more important than ever that Daera offers not just guidance, but absolute cooperation, coordination and practical support to every farm and every community affected. ""This must be matched by full engagement from all stakeholders across the agriculture and agri-food sector,"" Butler said. The detection of another case is not surprising, given how this disease spreads. It was always the expectation that more would come. But the location of the new control zone and its subsequent movement restrictions will raise concerns. Saintfield livestock mart which is firmly in the original zone has already been suspended. The minister warned last week that he would consider extending the zone across Northern Ireland as and when new cases emerge. That is something he may find himself having to implement sooner rather than later to ease the management of animals on farm. Bluetongue virus affects cattle, goats, sheep, deer and camelids such as llamas and alpacas. It can cause ulcers or sores around the animal's mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness, foetal deformities and stillbirths. It is a notifiable disease so anyone suspecting their animals may have it must report it to a vet, local divisional veterinary office or to Daera directly. The latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep died, and midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south-east of England too. But the impact of BTV-3 seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection and managing to recover.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14vg0xplxro
2025-12-06,Strange pillar of light linked to Chinese rocket,science,BBC,"A glowing streak spotted in the sky on Thursday morning was most likely caused by a Chinese rocket, experts say. Witnesses reported a bright, linear trail visible around dawn and dusk from several locations. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the US, said: ""It was definitely the Chinese Zhuque-3 rocket making its first test flight. ""It passed over the UK and northern Europe at around 05:00 GMT at the end of its first orbit, following launch from China at 04:02 GMT. Chinese upper stages have been previously observed to make long, linear propellant-dump trails."" Ellie Jarvis, from Clovelly, said: ""I've never seen anything like it. At first, I wondered whether it might be something like an aurora or a natural phenomenon - like a light pillar. ""I tried to see whether there was something shining a beam of light from across the bay, or perhaps from a ship - but that didn't  seem likely as the light seemed to be so high in the sky."" A jet contrail was also considered but dismissed because the trail appeared too widespread. Similar vertical light effects, known as light pillars, can sometimes form when high-altitude ice crystals reflect low-angle sunlight, creating unusual atmospheric displays.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98ze8jx7o
2025-12-06,Visionary botanist was 'Attenborough of his day',science,BBC,"""You can gauge a country's wealth, its real wealth, by its tree cover."" The words of Richard St Barbe Baker OBE, a botanist and visionary environmental activist with a passion for trees. Born in 1889 in West End, near Southampton in Hampshire, he travelled the world promoting reforestation and founded the organisation Men of the Trees, now known as the Oxford-based International Tree Foundation. Hailed as an early eco-warrior and the ""David Attenborough of his day"", it is estimated that his work led to trillions of trees being planted worldwide. ""He was really ahead of his time in recognising the importance of trees and forests in sustaining life on earth,"" said local author Martin Brisland. ""Today, ecology and awareness of the interaction between trees, nature, wildlife, the seas and climate change is very, very relevant. But he was banging that drum 100 years ago."" Descended from a line of farmers, parsons and evangelists, St Barbe Baker studied biology and botany before travelling to Kenya as a forestry officer with the British government, said Mr Brisland. It was here that he set up the Men of the Trees organisation [now the International Tree Foundation] in 1922 to carry out managed reforestation. The organisation's Esther Spencer said St Barbe Baker was a man ""who loved trees and loved plants"". ""He was incredibly inspirational,"" she said. ""I think he was a bit of the David Attenborough of his day. ""He was deeply saddened by the loss of trees and he started working with one of the local communities to plant trees. ""The community there, they obviously farmed and worked the land, but they said that trees were God's work, that God planted the trees, but they dealt with the crops. ""St Barbe Baker said 'no, we need to plant these trees'."" The foundation created through his work with that community was called Watu wa Miti, Swahili for Men of the Trees. ""It was supposed to speak to values, that these people love trees so much, you're a man of the trees,"" said Ms Spencer. Thanks to the work of the International Tree Foundation, his legacy continues to grow. In St Barbe Baker's words: ""Planting and growing increasing quantities of trees is the scientific solution to Earth's environmental dilemma."" His lasting legacy is evident around the village of West End, where several roads roads are named after trees such as Chester, Lyme and Redwood in tribute to the environmental pioneer. And in a small park near a busy main road sits a bronze plaque on top of stone plinth. It reads: ""Richard St Barbe Baker OBE.

2025-12-05,'Dispose of batteries properly to avoid fires',science,BBC,"A warning has been issued about disposing of items containing batteries this Christmas. Things such as toys, power tools, vapes, small gadgets and some Christmas cards can contain hidden batteries which are not always possible to remove before they are thrown away. They can explode and cause fires in homes and at recycling centres. Lee Wilkins, of Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""Fires caused by batteries in recycling centres are completely avoidable."" The advice is to take items with batteries in them to a recycling point instead of throwing them away at home. FCC Environment, which runs 11 recycling centres on behalf of Suffolk County Council, has seen a sharp rise in the number of fires caused by batteries and electronic items. In April, a fire caused by a battery at the Red Lodge site near Newmarket took eight days to put out and caused £60,000-worth of damage. Chris Chambers, the Conservative-controlled council's cabinet member for waste, said: ""We've seen first-hand in Suffolk how incorrectly disposing of batteries can pose a danger to the environment and local communities. ""Incidents can also delay bin collection services, reduce opening hours at recycling centres or even close them – and this time of year is when the industry is at its busiest.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xdgwrvlz9o
2025-12-05,Logistic and ethical issues raised over whalebones,science,BBC,"Plans to replace Whitby's famous Whale Bone Arch are facing a number of logistical and ethical obstacles, a council has said. The feature, which is one the town's ""most enjoyed landmarks"", has stood at the top of West Cliff for more than 170 years, but despite being replaced in 2002 the structure is deteriorating. Replacing the bones, however, has presented a series of challenges, including how to source and transport a fresh set from North America, but also whether or not to use real or replica bones. ​Whitby Town Council has asked North Yorkshire Council to undertake ""urgent investigations"" and to provide options for replacement, refurbishment, and alternatives such as imitation bones. The last replacement bones came from Whitby's twin town of Barrow in Alaska after a worldwide appeal, from a whale that was killed legally by native Inuit in 1996, according to the Chris Bourne, North Yorkshire Council's head of harbours, who was involved in procuring the existing bones 25 years ago, said he is in communication with the mayor's office in Anchorage, Alaska, over the possibility of procuring a new set. He said that Alaskan authorities ""are currently trying to speak to those involved previously at North Slope Borough (Barrow)."" However, he added: ​""It would be likely the bones would be in a very remote location on the Arctic ice shelf and there would have to be a willingness for the residents to recover and move them to a suitable location."" ​The bones would then require thorough cleaning before a logistics company would carry them on an aircraft, and the ""biggest hurdle"", according to the council, would be gaining the right permission to import the bones to the UK. ​The species, Balaena Mystecitus, is protected under CITES regulation, which led to a ""lengthy, time-consuming process"" last time. ​In addition to logistical and transport issues, ethical questions have also been raised about using the bones of an endangered species. ​A North Yorkshire Council said: ""There is greater concern globally about hunting and it is somewhat less socially acceptable to display real bones."" As a result ​Whitby Town Council has been recommended to consider alternatives such as the use of imitation whale bones, which would ""now be more fitting"" alongside an information board. ​At a town council meeting in September 2024, members of the public highlighted the poor condition of the whale bones and the urgent need for maintenance. However the council said it has not received any further response on the availability of whalebones from Alaska, but is ""chasing the issue"".

Grundon Waste Management has teamed up with homelessness charity Crisis to raise awareness of the risks of seeking shelter in them. The company, which has depots in Banbury and Wallingford in Oxfordshire, as well as Beenham in Berkshire, said one of its drivers found a man sleeping inside one of them last December. David Goodwin, who works in Banbury, found the bin was heavy and on investigating further found the occupant. ""As drivers, we are always trained to be alert to anything unusual and it was one of those split-second moments when you realise something isn't right,"" he said. ""I immediately stepped back from the bin and was hugely relieved to find that although the gentleman inside was a bit shaken up, he was unharmed. ""He told me that previously, he would listen out for the sound of a diesel engine as a warning of a vehicle approaching. ""Because I was in an electric vehicle, which is much quieter, he didn't hear it approach."" Reg Hodson, Grundon's head of safety, health, environment and quality, said as quieter electric vehicles became more common, its staff would need to be ""more vigilant"". Typical signs that someone might be inside a bin might include broken locks, rubbish scattered on the ground and evidence of a person's belongings nearby. Francesca Albanese, Crisis's executive director of policy and social change, said: ""We are tragically seeing more and more people forced to sleep on our streets. ""Faced with danger and uncertainty, people can seek shelter from the cold and to keep themselves hidden from view for their own safety.

2025-12-07,Death toll from devastating Indonesia floods passes 900,science,BBC,"The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing. More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country. Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places. The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges. One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes. Fitriana said: ""There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking."" She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go. One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village. He said: ""That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village].

2025-12-05,Deep-sea mining tests impact over a third of seabed animals - scientists,science,BBC,"Machines mining minerals in the deep ocean have been found to cause significant damage to life on the seabed, scientists carrying out the largest study of its kind say. The number of animals found in the tracks of the vehicles was reduced by 37% compared to untouched areas, according to the scientists. The researchers discovered more than 4,000 animals, 90% of which were new species, living on the seafloor in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean. Vast amounts of critical minerals needed for green technologies could be locked in the deep ocean, but deep sea mining in international waters is very controversial and currently not permitted until more is known about the environmental impacts. The research by scientists at the Natural History Museum in London, the UK National Oceanography Centre and the University of Gothenburg was conducted at the request of deep sea mining company The Metals Company. The scientists said their work was independent and that the company was able to view the results before publication but was not allowed to alter them. The team compared biodiversity two years before and two months after the test mining that drove machines for 80km on the seafloor. They looked specifically at animals 0.3mm – 2cm in size, such as worms, sea spiders, snails and clams. In the tracks of the vehicle, the number of animals fell by 37% and the diversity of species by 32%. ""The machine removes about the top five centimetres of sediment. That's where most of the animals live. So obviously, if you're removing the sediment, you're removing the animals in it too,"" lead author Eva Stewart, PhD student at the Natural History Museum and the University of Southampton, told BBC News. ""Even if they are not killed by the machine, pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species,"" said Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras from the National Oceanography Centre. A few of the animals could have moved away, but ""whether or not they come back after disturbance is a different question"", she added. However, in the areas near the vehicle tracks, where clouds of sediment landed, the abundance of animals did not decrease. ""We were expecting possibly a bit more impact, but [we didn't] see much, just a shift in which species were dominant over others,"" Dr Adrian Glover, research scientist at the Natural History Museum, told BBC News. ""​We're ​encouraged ​by these ​data,"" a spokesperson for The Metals Company told BBC News. ""After ​years ​of ​activist ​alarm ​that ​our ​impacts ​would ​spread ​thousands ​of ​kilometers ​beyond ​the ​mine ​site, ​the ​data ​show ​that ​any ​biodiversity ​impacts ​are ​limited ​to ​the ​directly ​mined ​area,"" they added. But some experts do not think that this is good news for mining companies. ""I think the study shows that current technologies for harvesting are too damaging to permit large-scale commercial exploration,"" Dr Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at think tank Chatham House, told BBC News. ""These were only tests and the impact was significant. If they did that at large scale, it would be even more damaging,"" he added. Deep sea mining is controversial. At the heart of the debate is a difficult problem. The latest research took place in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a 6m sq km area of the Pacific Ocean estimated to hold over 21bn tonnes of nickel, cobalt and copper-rich polymetallic nodules. The world needs these critical minerals for renewable energy technologies to tackle climate change. They are essential components in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, for example. The International Energy Agency predicts that The minerals have to come from somewhere, but some scientists and environmental groups are gravely concerned that mining the deep seas could cause untold damage. Some fear that before we have the chance to explore the full nature of life in the undiscovered deep ocean, it could be endangered. Oceans play a critical role in regulating our planet and are already at severe risk from rising temperatures. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), which governs activity in international waters, has not yet approved commercial mining although it has issued 31 licences for exploration. A total of 37 countries, including the UK and France, are backing a temporary ban on mining. This week Norway postponed mining plans in its waters including the Arctic. But in April, US President Donald Trump called for domestic and international projects to be fast-tracked, as the US wants to secure the supply of minerals for use in weapons. If the ISA concludes that current mining techniques are too destructive, companies could try to develop less intrusive ways of extracting nodules from the seafloor. The research is published in the scientific journal Nature ​Ecology ​and ​Evolution.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedx2p8gnx9o
2025-12-06,Plans for anaerobic digestion plant approved,science,BBC,"Plans for an anaerobic digestion plant in Lincolnshire have been approved. Future Biogas applied to East Lindsey District Council to build the facility, alongside an office, access and associated infrastructure, on land west of the B1202 near Wragby. Members of the council's planning committee approved the application, subject to conditions, at a meeting on Thursday. According to the company, the plant would be capable of producing 150 gigawatt hours of biomethane annually – enough to power 35,000 homes. Anaerobic digestion generates energy by breaking down organic matter, creating biogas which can be pumped into the national gas grid. Lorries would be used to transport a variety of locally farmed crops to the anaerobic digester. Philipp Lukas, chief executive of Future Biogas, said: ""We already work with 400 farmers across the east of England and our reputation, both locally and nationally, is very high among our farming communities and our local communities at our existing plants. ""I think this represents an opportunity for local farmers to transition to more regenerative and sustainable practices,"" he added. Councillor Richard Cunnington said, while he supported the application, he was concerned about the timings that lorries were allowed to enter the site - up until 21:00. ""Residents deserve peace and quiet. They deserve to be able to have a sit out in their garden with a BBQ at this time of night."" , Andrew Booth, development manager lead officer at the council, said the conditions had been carefully considered by the environmental health team and were an ""appropriate and reasonable balance"".

""That went on for a couple of minutes and then some people got out of a car and tried to shoo it off. ""This has been going on since Thursday and it's a wonder there hasn't been an accident."" Ms Holroyde said the first time she saw one of the boars she was ""quite surprised"". She added: ""Some of the cars coming towards me were flashing, so I was going relatively slowly, and as I came round a very steep left hand bend I literally came face-to-face with the larger of the two. ""He just stood there, and I put my brakes on, and then he decided he'd walk to the side and went past me."" She described the creature as ""absolutely beautiful, an amazing animal to look at, but not what you're expecting when you're in a bit of a rush to pick up your child from school"". In a Facebook post East Hants Police said it was ""aware that a wild boar has been sighted on Stoner Hill Road Petersfield"", and for drivers to ""please bear it in mind"". ""If you are driving around this area, please be mindful of this and drive carefully and at an appropriate speed,"" it said. Ms Holroyde called on authorities to capture the animals and relocate them to a safer area. She said: ""It would be awful if something happened to them, but likewise they really could cause quite an accident, and it's not an easy road anyway.

2025-12-04,Green innovation corridor plans set to be approved,science,BBC,"Plans are set to be approved that will allow future projects to be delivered as part of Wolverhampton's ""green innovation corridor"" (GIC). The GIC is a district in the city , and hopes to influence the region's transition to net-zero. It connects the University of Wolverhampton's Springfield campus, Science Park, and the i54 advanced manufacturing business park. Wolverhampton City Council's cabinet will meet on 10 December to agree a plan that will see a £20m Local Regeneration Fund grant assigned to the projects, managed by the university and the council. The grant money would support further improvements to the university's facilities to maximise research, development and commercial opportunities, the council said. The authority also wants to improve existing lighting, wayfinding and highways to provide safer and more accessible routes between the campus and city centre. In addition, it plans to add extra substation capacity at the university's science park, which would increase laboratory space. Councillor Chris Burden, cabinet member for city development, jobs and skills, said the GIC would drive the ""green industrial revolution"" in Wolverhampton. He added it would build on the city's ""sustainable construction [and] green credentials"", and create  jobs and training opportunities. Dr Pete Cross, chief operating officer at the university, said: ""By expanding our research capabilities and creating spaces for collaboration, we will enable businesses to develop cutting-edge solutions in green construction, advanced manufacturing and engineering."" West Midlands Investment Zone funding totalling £7m has already been allocated to the first phase of the GIC. A hybrid planning application has been put forward to redevelop four brownfield sites, collectively known as Six Mile Green, close to the university's science park. If approved, the funding would be used to carry out preconstruction works by March 2027.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewjdqzgzvyo

2025-12-05,Turkey breeder supplying luxury stores investigated over welfare,science,BBC,"A turkey farm that breeds premium birds which are then sold at Christmas in high-end stores and butchers has been suspended from a food standards assurance scheme amid allegations of poor biosecurity and animal welfare standards. Hockenhull Turkeys in Lincolnshire is being investigated by Red Tractor after welfare campaigners secretly filmed workers not following biosecurity measures, throwing birds and, in one case, a staff member urinating in a pen of birds. The Spilsby facility supplies young birds – known as poults - to farms, including one that supplies Harrods with turkeys selling for up to £170. Hockenhull Turkeys told the BBC it had suspended workers while an investigation takes place. The footage, which was captured by environmental campaign group Green Britain Foundation in July and August, shows one worker walking into a pen full of live turkeys before urinating. Workers are also seen not following basic biosecurity practices, moving between sheds without changing boots or using foot dips, and throwing and mishandling birds. A spokesman for Hockenhull Turkeys, which is owned by global company Aviagen Turkeys, said they were ""appalled and very concerned"" to see the secret filming which ""does not represent the standards of animal husbandry and biosecurity we expect"". ""High biosecurity and animal welfare standards are of the utmost importance to us and it is clear here that we have failed to live up to that promise,"" he said. He added that the ""vast majority"" of staff ""care deeply"" for the animals in their care and that the footage ""does not represent a typical day at Hockenhull"". Red Tractor, a farm and food assurance scheme that ensures its members meet certain standards for food safety, animal welfare and traceability, has suspended Hockenhull Turkey's certification ""pending an independent investigation"". ""We take breaches of these standards extremely seriously and will always act on credible evidence of non-compliance,"" a spokesman told the BBC. It said it had also sent its own assessor to the site to investigate the issues raised by the footage. Turkeys bred at the site are supplied to farms that use traditional rearing and slaughtering methods to produce higher-quality meat, a standard known as ""farmfresh"". Such Hockenhull turkeys are sold by the luxury department store Harrods. A Harrods spokeswoman said they did not have a ""direct relationship"" with Hockenhull Turkeys itself but that a farm supplier that uses their breed of turkey was ""now thoroughly and urgently investigating any evidence of a breach in standards from the supplier of Hockenhull poults"". She added that the farm supplier adhered to strict standards set by the industry body, the Traditional Farmfresh Turkey Association (TFTA). The BBC has approached the TFTA for comment. Dale Vince, of the Green Britain Foundation, called for Harrods to suspend supplies from Hockenhull and launch an independent investigation, with the findings made public. ""Anything less is not really living up to their reputation,"" he said. The government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), which monitors animal welfare on farms, is also investigating. A spokeswoman said: ""We take breaches of animal welfare legislation very seriously and will always take action where we find this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlk2d3elp9o
2025-12-04,Volcanic eruption may have triggered Europe's deadly Black Death plague,science,BBC,"A volcanic eruption around the year 1345 may have set off a chain reaction that unleashed Europe's deadliest pandemic, the Black Death, scientists say. Clues preserved in tree rings suggest the eruption triggered a climate shock and led to a string of events that brought the disease to medieval Europe. Under this scenario, the ash and gases from a volcanic eruption caused extreme drops in temperature and led to poor harvests. To avert famine, populous Italian city states were forced to import grain from areas around the Black Sea - bringing plague-carrying fleas that carried the disease to Europe as well. This ""perfect storm"" of a climate shock, famine and trade offers a reminder of how diseases can emerge and spread in a globalised and warmer world, according to experts. ""Although the coincidence of factors that contributed to the Black Death seems rare, the probability of zoonotic diseases emerging under climate change and translating into pandemics is likely to increase in a globalised world,"" said Dr Ulf Büntgen of the University of Cambridge. He added: ""This is especially relevant given our recent experiences with Covid-19."" The Black Death swept across Europe in 1348-49, killing up to half of the population. The disease was caused by a bacterium known as spread by wild rodents, such as rats, and fleas. The outbreak is believed to have started in Central Asia, moving around the world through trade. But the precise sequence of events that brought the disease to Europe - killing millions of people – has been pored over by scholars. Now researchers from the University of Cambridge and the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO) in Leipzig have filled in a missing part of the puzzle. They used clues from tree rings and ice cores to examine climatic conditions at the time of the Black Death. Their evidence suggests that volcanic activity around 1345 caused temperatures to drop sharply over consecutive years because of the release of volcanic ash and gases which blocked out some sunlight. This in turn caused crops to fail across the Mediterranean region. To avoid starvation, Italian city states traded with grain producers around the Black Sea, unwittingly enabling the deadly bacterium to gain a foothold in Europe. Dr Martin Bauch, a historian of medieval climate and epidemiology from GWZO, said climatic events met a ""complicated system of food security"" in what amounted to a ""perfect storm"". ""For more than a century, these powerful Italian city states had established long-distance trade routes across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, allowing them to activate a highly efficient system to prevent starvation,"" he said. ""But ultimately, these would inadvertently lead to a far bigger catastrophe."" The findings are reported in the journal",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5gr2x914ro
2025-12-04,Indian scientists spot Milky Way-like galaxy from 12 billion years ago,science,BBC,"Astronomers in India say their discovery of a massive galaxy from when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old challenges our understanding of how galaxies were formed in the early period after the Simply put, if the Universe is 13.8 billion years old, it means we're seeing a galaxy from 12 billion years ago when the cosmos was only one-tenth of its current age. Scientists say galaxies that formed so early were found to be mostly irregular in shape and chaotic. But when researchers Rashi Jain and Yogesh Wadadekar used James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to peer into the Universe's early past, they spied a ""fully-formed spiral galaxy - a massive, beautifully structured cosmic pinwheel"". was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, a leading European journal, in November. ""The galaxy looks remarkably similar to our own Milky Way, despite being present when the universe was only 10% of its current age,"" said Prof Wadadekar, adding that they've named it Alaknanda after a Himalayan river. The galaxy was spotted by Ms Jain, a PhD researcher at the Pune-based National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR) earlier this year. Ms Jain says she was ""really excited"" when she spotted the galaxy while poring over the data and images from James Webb, the $10bn jointly by the US, European and Canadian space agencies in 2021. ""I had been looking at details of 70,000 objects and there was only one there that was a grand design spiral galaxy, spanning approximately 30,000 light-years in diameter,"" she says. In simple words, it means that the galaxy had two symmetrical arms emanating from a disc at the centre, wrapping around a bright central bulge, she explains. ""We could see the typical 'beads-on a-string' pattern which is like clusters of stars along the spiral arms, similar to what we see in nearby spiral galaxies today."" When she told her supervisor Prof Wadadekar, his initial reaction was of disbelief. ""It's astonishing how such a large galaxy with spiral arms could have existed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang,"" he told the BBC. ""This galaxy had to assemble 10 billion solar masses of stars and simultaneously form a large disc with spiral arms in just a few hundred million years. That's incredibly rapid by cosmic standards,"" he said. According to Nasa, there are an estimated hundred billion galaxies and many began forming within millions of years of the Big Bang. Astronomers have long believed that the Universe at the time – a period known as cosmic dawn - was very chaotic and the galaxies were small and low in mass. ""But this galaxy is a different beast,"" says Prof Wadadekar. ""It's massive, it's one-third of the Milky Way in size, and has 10 billion stars. The galaxy is forming new stars at a rate that's roughly 20-30 times faster than our Milky Way's current star formation rate."" Since James Webb began operations, astronomers have been finding newer, more distant galaxies. In images shared by Nasa in initial years, many looked like But in recent years, Webb has been discovering more sophisticated structures, including spiral galaxies - and the new galaxy's discovery adds to that pile of growing evidence that early Universe was much more creative. ""Finding such a well-formed spiral galaxy so far back in time is a rare exception, but such exceptions challenge our understanding of the universe's early past and how galaxies formed and evolved,"" Ms Jain says. ""This galaxy shows that Universe was much more mature early on and that sophisticated structures were being built in our universe much earlier than we thought possible,"" she adds. The information about the new galaxy, however, is from 12 billion years ago - the galaxy lies at a distance from where its light has travelled for that many years to reach us. ""We can see into the past because the light has reached us. A galaxy's lifetime is so big that we can't see it from start to finish, so we do statistical studies,"" says Ms Jain. So is there a status update? What's happened to it? Is it still there – and in what shape and form? ""When people ask me about where it is at present, I tell them wait for 12 billion years to see where it is now,"" says Prof Wadadekar. For the moment though, the researchers say they would apply to do follow-up observations with James Webb or the Alma observatory in Chile to understand how the newly discovered galaxy managed to create its spiral arms. Because the keys to our present and future, they say, lie in the past.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmdk7wkmz4o

2025-12-04,RSPCA sees 'heartbreaking' rise in neglect calls,science,BBC,"The RSPCA has revealed data showing a ""heartbreaking"" increase in the number of animal neglect reports. The charity said its emergency line received 73,294 reports of neglect in England and Wales from January up to the end of October, a a 30% increase compared with the same period in 2024. ""The truth is, times are desperately tough – and innocent animals are tragically the ones paying the ultimate price,"" said RSPCA superintendent Simon Osborne. The charity highlighted cases of animals in the West Midlands region it had rescued, including Morticia the cat, who was handed into a vet practice with her four kittens, who were all dumped in a carrier bag. She is currently looking for a home in Worcestershire, where figures showed a 16% rise in calls to the RSPCA – with 718 so far this year, compared to 618 in 2024. In Shropshire, the charity said it had received 533 reports about neglected animals in the first 10 months of the year - a 17% rise on the 456 in the same period last year. In Staffordshire, RSPCA officers had 1,306 reports of neglect between January to October – an increase of 21% on the 1,080 on the first 10 months of last year. Dog Marnie, who was taken into the care of the RSPCA Coventry branch's animal centre after being rescued by inspectors, is also among those looking for a new home. The charity said nationally it was helping 70 animals per day to find new places to live. ""Animals are facing shocking levels of neglect right now - they are often starving behind closed doors and being left without the treatment they urgently need,"" Mr Osborne said. The charity's figures shows that in the West Midlands conurbation, there were 2,793 reports about neglected animals this year up until the end of October. That amount was a 12% increase on the comparable figures for 2024, in which 2,493 reports were made.

2025-12-04,Scottish energy firms invest £5.4bn as part of UK grid upgrade,science,BBC,"The energy regulator has given the go-ahead for £5.4bn to be spent upgrading the electricity transmission network in Scotland. Scottish Power, which runs the network in central and southern Scotland, will invest about £2bn while SSE, which has the northern network, will spend £3.4bn. Ofgem said home energy bills would rise to fund the upgrade, but in the long-term it would help lower the reliance on imported gas and make wholesale energy cheaper. Scottish Power said its investment was part of a larger £12bn package that would double the workforce within its SP Energy Networks business, with 1,400 new roles. SSE said it planned to inject an even bigger sum, about £22bn, over the same period. SP Energy Networks is one of several companies that run energy networks - including power lines, cables and gas pipes. These have monopolies in different parts of the UK and are separate from suppliers. Scottish Power's chief executive Keith Anderson said the UK was building a grid that was ""fit for purpose for the 21st Century"". : ""If we want to build houses, if we want to build data centres, if we want to get investment into the country, we need the electricity infrastructure to allow all of that. ""Without it, there would be no economic growth in the United Kingdom."" Ofgem's plan sets the framework for the cost controls energy firms face over the next five years.  It estimates that £108 will be added to energy bills by 2031. But Ofgem also says that people would end up saving about £80 more than they otherwise would, as the investment will help lower the reliance on imported gas and make wholesale energy cheaper, leading to a net energy bill rise of about £30. Scottish Power predicts that it would add about £12 per year for its customers. It says the network upgrade is expected to reduce constraint costs – the costs to turn off generators when there is no way of transporting their electricity – by around £5bn per year. Keith Anderson said: ""If you look at that price cap, right now by the time we get to April the chancellor is already taking £150 off that price. ""As we start to build this grid out, we'll bring the price down even further. ""We'll open up the grid to more investment in renewable and remove the volatility of gas prices on the system. ""Overall, we'll end up with a cheaper system."" Scottish Power said the investment would bring jobs across the country, in particular in the south of Scotland where it is upgrading the network. ""Because the infrastructure goes into local communities, into Dumfries and Galloway into South Ayrshire, these jobs are in those local areas,"" Mr Anderson  said. ""We want people to be employed directly from schools, from colleges in all of those communities."" He said it would provide opportunities for apprenticeships and graduates across Scotland. He told BBC Scotland News: ""This year I'm still looking for another 300 people to join our company, then another 1,000 people next year, and by 2027 another 2,000 on the back of delivering all this work. ""This is fantastic news for the country, for jobs."" An extra 310 miles (500km) of lines is needed over the next five years in central and southern Scotland. As part of its investment, SP Energy Networks will begin work to build 12 new substations, upgrade 450km of existing circuits and 87km of overhead lines and replace 35km of underground cable by 2031. off the east coast of Scotland. A growth in renewable generation in Scotland is expected to far exceed the amount that can be consumed, and so much of it will have to be exported to England. Mr Anderson  said: ""We need to get the electricity moving around the country if we want the whole of the country to benefit from this. ""Some of this will be strengthening existing lines, putting more capacity through them, then there are also new lines. ""For any community being impacted there will be a engagement process, looking at what we're doing, how we're doing it, when we're doing it and where the line goes, and where the substation goes. ""All the local communities will be involved in that debate to get this done in a way that is a beneficial to everybody.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq5kx5k1qo

2025-12-04,Government approves new 190MW solar farm,science,BBC,"Campaigners have criticised the government's decision to approve a solar energy development in the North Yorkshire countryside. Energy Minister Martin McCluskey said the 190MW Helios Solar Farm, based close to the village of Camblesforth, near Selby, was a step towards making Britain a clean energy ""superpower"". But residents living nearby said ""pure lip service"" had been paid to a public consultation. Developer Enso Energy said the site would provide enough energy to power 47,500 homes. McCluskey granted a Development Consent Order - a type of planning permission used for nationally significant infrastructure projects - for the development on Wednesday. In a report on the scheme he said the ""national need"" outweighed any potential adverse impacts. The report said: ""Families in Yorkshire have seen their energy bills go through the roof as a result of our exposure to volatile gas prices. ""The only way to make British people better off in the long-term is by securing clean, homegrown power that we control. ""Giving the green light to the Helios Solar Farm is another step forward in our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower, creating jobs, driving economic growth and protecting family finances."" , the project will be one of the largest of its kind in the UK, covering 476 hectares of agricultural land. The development, which will include a battery energy storage scheme (BESS), will connect to the grid via underground cable at the nearby Drax power station. A spokesperon for the campaign group HALT, which was formed to fight the scheme, said members felt ""huge disappointment, frustration, despondency, extreme sadness and fear for their future"" at news of the decision. They added: ""Many believe it to have been a foregone conclusion, given that their responses were sought but in most cases blatantly ignored, dismissed, or met with unsubstantiated assurances that they would be addressed satisfactorily but with no guarantees."" They went on to say the government's ""ideological and politically imposed target"" to achieve net zero by 2050 had meant their concerns had been overridden. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming ""greenhouse"" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere. Effectively this means no longer adding to the total amount of these gases in the atmosphere to limit climate change. The Helios development is one of a number of solar farms proposed for the former Selby district that are currently going through the planning process.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8q25v80rqo

""This is a completely voluntary and democratic system - users may choose to activate the app and avail its benefits, or if they do not wish to, they can easily delete it from their phone at any time,"" he wrote on X. The minister did not, however, clarify how this would be done if the app's functions cannot be disabled or restricted. Launched in January, the Sanchar Saathi app allows users to check a device's IMEI, report lost or stolen phones and flag suspected fraud communications. An IMEI - the International Mobile Equipment Identity - is a unique 15-digit code that identifies and authenticates a mobile device on cellular networks. The code is  essentially the phone's serial number. In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose ""serious endangerment"" to telecom cyber security. ""India has big second-hand mobile device market. Cases have also been observed where stolen or blacklisted devices are being re-sold,"" it said, adding that this makes the purchaser an ""abetter in crime and causes financial loss to them"". Under the new rules,  the pre-installed app must be ""readily visible and accessible"" to users when they set up a device and its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. Smartphone makers must also ""make an endeavour"" to provide the app through software updates for devices that are out of factories but haven't been sold yet, the statement said. All companies have been asked to give compliance reports on the order in 120 days. The government says the move will bolster telecom cybersecurity. A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone. But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance. Technology analyst Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset. ""We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,"" he told the BBC. On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it. Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple. “Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,"" he says, ""barring in China and Russia”. While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and ""will convey its concerns to Delhi"". India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification. In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedxyvx74p4o
2025-12-03,Waste bins could be collected every three weeks,science,BBC,"Residents could see their rubbish collected every three weeks under new plans. As two of Wiltshire Council's waste contracts come to an end, proposals set to be discussed on Tuesday suggest food waste should be collected weekly, recycling every two weeks and residual waste every three weeks. Privately-run recycling centres at Purton and Lower Compton could also be shut under the plans, while a new centre could be opened in North Wiltshire. Under the proposals, a new food waste caddy would also be given to every household. The council wants to increase its recycling rate from just over 40% to just over 60%, and lower the amount of waste sent to landfill from about 13% to 3%. Wiltshire Council leader Ian Thorn said contracts for kerbside collection and sorting materials would be moved to local authority trading companies (LATCOs) to allow the council to reinvest any profit made back into the system. He added there was evidence which showed less frequent residual waste collections increased recycling. Councillor Paul Sample said: ""These changes are about building a waste service for the future. ""We will cut carbon emissions, save taxpayers' money and make it easier for residents to do the right thing for the environment."" The council is also looking at introducing a phased rollout of a booking system for recycling centres. It said this would help reduce queues, cut emissions, and make visits easier and quicker for everyone, especially in areas where residents said congestion could be problematic and causes safety issues.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62dx67160wo
2025-12-02,No objection advised to sixth energy storage scheme near village,science,BBC,"Councillors are being advised not to object to plans for a sixth battery energy storage system (BESS) development near a Borders village. Since 2022, four schemes have been approved near Leitholm while Scottish Borders Council (SBC) has opposed a fifth - triggering a public inquiry into the plans. Residents of the village - between Coldstream and Greenlaw - warned last year that A report to SBC's planning committee has recommended it does not object to the latest application by Bishops Dal Energy with the final decision lying with the Scottish government's Energy Consents Unit. The area has become a hotbed for applications due to its proximity to the Eccles substation which is being expanded. The latest project would see 96 container-sized storage systems, a substation and fencing and new entrances put up. It has attracted significant opposition due to safety concerns, visual impact and the loss of farmland. However, SBC is being advised not to lodge an objection. A report to councillors said a ""significant increase"" in BESS developments was required nationally to help meet net zero greenhouse gas targets. The systems provide storage for energy from renewable sources to meet grid demands and allow network flexibility. The report said the principle of developing land in the area for such projects had ""previously been accepted"" and no policy existed to limit the number which could be developed. ""It is recognised that the existing BESS approvals at Eccles already provide the ability to store a significant amount of energy at this location,"" it said. ""This latest development may pose further cumulative challenges (in terms of connectivity and capacity), but importantly, current national and local planning policy and guidance does not set any limits on energy storage requirements. ""Therefore, each proposal must still be considered on its own individual merits."" It concluded the project would have some ""minor landscape and visual impacts"" and that any other material planning implications could be addressed by ""appropriately worded"" conditions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17x5z1dedqo

The ""masked bandit"" was found passed out in the bathroom between the toilet and bin having helped itself to bottles on a bottom shelf. Animal control officer Samantha Martin transported the ""suspect"" for questioning at Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter but not before it had a chance to sober up. After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover), the animal was safely released back into the wild. The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered its ""Black Friday break-in"". When staff arrived on Saturday they found smashed bottles and liquor pooling on the floor, including its apparent tipple of choice, scotch. Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going ""on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything"". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom. In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a ""sober ride home"".

2025-12-02,Campaigners call for action against Thames Water,science,BBC,"Campaigners say they will submit statutory nuisance complaints against Thames Water to ask councils to hold the company legally responsible for sewage pollution. River Action said documents submitted by Thames Water to regulator Ofwat showed work to 93 sewage treatment works and water pumping stations it said it would upgrade remains incomplete. It said it will submit complaints to councils in London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Buckinghamshire, asking them to take ""decisive action"" to stop Thames Water polluting. A Thames Water spokesperson said it told regulators in 2023 it would not be able to deliver all of the upgrades but that it is ""committed to seeing waterways thrive"". In action backed by Olympic rowing champions Sir Steve Redgrave and Imogen Grant, who said she will hand in a notice to Wokingham Council herself, River Action said sewage dumping constitutes a statutory nuisance in law. It said it hopes the councils will investigate whether a statutory nuisance has happened or is happening and will take steps to investigate. If the authority finds there is a nuisance, it can issue an abatement notice, which would order Thames Water to stop the nuisance or face criminal prosecution. ""As someone who has spent my life on the water, I am appalled by the pollution that Thames Water continues to allow,"" Sir Steve said. ""That's why I'm joining River Action and communities along the River Thames in taking action to hold this company to account. ""Our rivers should be safe for everyone. It is unacceptable that people are being forced to fight for clean, healthy waterways."" The group said it has or will send statutory nuisance complaints to the following councils: Grant, who won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics in 2024, said: ""Rivers are our lifeblood, for sport, wildlife, and community, and it's shocking to see them poisoned by untreated sewage time and time again. ""I have filed a nuisance claim with Wokingham because I've had enough of pollution putting me and other river users at risk,"" she added. ""I stand with River Action to hold Thames Water accountable and protect the rivers we all rely on."" River Action said that sewage spill hours from Newbury into the River Kennet had increased by 240% between 2019 and 2024. It said Thames Water data showed E. coli levels in treated effluent in the Thames at Henley-on-Thames reached more than 30 times the safe limit for designated bathing water. The Thames Water spokesperson said the company knows ""how much people enjoy and appreciate rivers"" and that is why it is ""embarking on the biggest upgrade to our network in 150 years and targeting a record of £9.5bn (in 2022/23 prices) of investment across our wastewater assets over the next five years"". These upgrades will increase treatment capacity, lower the number of storm discharges and implement nutrient reduction schemes. ""We informed Ofwat, the Environment Agency and other industry stakeholders in August 2023 that some Water Industry National Environmental Programme (WINEP) schemes would not be delivered on time,"" they added. They said Thames Water ""remains committed to delivering all our WINEP obligations"". ""We are committed to seeing waterways thrive, but we can't do it alone. Farming, industry, road runoff, wildlife, and increasingly extreme weather also play a role in river health,"" the spokesperson added. ""We understand that all untreated discharges, even when permitted, are unacceptable, however it's important to remember the sewage system was historically designed this way to prevent sewage backing up into people's homes.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce912gx0r45o
2025-12-04,Waste from UK's largest opencast mine 'poses significant risk',science,BBC,"Concerns have been raised over the safety of three large spoil tips set to be left above Merthyr Tydfil following the closure of the UK's last opencast coalmine. A geotechnical report prepared for the council warns of a ""significant risk of slope instability"" from Ffos-y-Fran, while campaigners say plans to keep the tips in place are ""staggering"". Emails obtained by the BBC show the Welsh government is considering stepping in to take control over the final planning decision. Mining firm Merthyr South Wales Ltd (MSW) said suggesting the ""purpose-built, engineered structures"" pose the same risks as historical coal tips is ""incorrect and misleading"". , there remains considerable uncertainty over the controversial project's future. Given the go-ahead back in 2005, the UK's largest opencast mine was officially classed as a ""land reclamation scheme"". That meant part of the profits made from selling 11 million tonnes of coal over 15 years had to be used to clean up the site - riddled with the remains of old industries - and return it to green hillside for the community. ""It was supposed to be for public amenity, they were going to reinstate all the rights of way and agricultural use,"" said Chris Austin, who lives nearby. Now he fears the community will be left with ""a dangerous void, dangerous tips and areas we can't use"". ""It's extremely worrying,"" agreed Alyson Austin, Chris' wife. ""We were forced to accept this opencast coalmine... now we're left with a situation far worse than we had right back at the beginning."" The current developers - MSW - had sparked anger locally and legal action after for well over a year past the deadline on their planning permission. They have since submitted a new - and far cheaper - restoration plan, warning of ""insufficient funds"" available to deliver what had previously been agreed. Under the original proposals, large spoil tips which had built up over the years would have been used to fill in the main mining void, which is 175m (574ft) deep. The tips - known as overburden mounds - contain 37 million cubic metres of material removed while the opencast mine was operating. The company now wants to reduce the height of one tip while leaving the other two in place. It describes them as long-term stable structures and says the mining void itself would become a "" The application is being considered by planners at Merthyr Tydfil council, who commissioned a geotechnical report from engineering firm WSP. That document concludes that the tips were constructed as ""temporary earthworks"" and the proposals ""do not provide confidence that the tips and slopes will remain stable and will not pose an ongoing risk to the residents of Merthyr Tydfil and a potential financial burden [to the council]"". The effect of climate change ""does not appear to have been considered"" - while in some cases it is ""dismissed with no supporting evidence"", the consultants warn. They also note that one of the tips - known as OB1 - which rises approximately 170m above a main road running alongside Ffos-y-Fran - had already suffered a landslide in 2022. The report also notes ""the recent history of a number of tip failures across south Wales as a result of high rainfall events"". Delyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru's climate spokesperson, warned the residents of Merthyr Tydfil faced having to live with ""a botched restoration"" and said leaving the tips in place would be ""staggering"" and ""unconscionable"". ""Coal tips slipping - this is not a theoretical risk,"" she said. The Welsh government has recently announced a new , set up in the wake of concerns over the country's coal tips, to be headquartered in Merthyr Tydfil. Haf Elgar, director of Friends of the Earth Cymru, warned it could now end up having to add Ffos-y-Fran's overburden mounds to its list of sites to monitor. ""That's an added burden on public authorities and totally unacceptable,"" she said. In a letter to the council, consultants on behalf of MSW said they had ""serious concerns"" about the geotechnical report, which they branded a ""desk-top assessment"". They responded by commissioning their own analysis from geological and mining consultancy James Associates, countering WSP's conclusions as to the tips' stability. It says the overburden mounds were constructed to an approved design in compliance with regulations and had been monitored by a specialist. The landslide on OB1 had happened as a result of excavation work, and the likelihood of it failing in future could be ""absolutely minimised"" with appropriate engineering, it said. Referring to recent landslides from old colliery tips in south Wales was ""a case of comparing 'apples and pears'"", the mine's consultants added. Generally colliery tips were located on steep hillsides, whereas Ffos-y-Fran's overburden mounds sit ""on ground with gentle gradients"", with differences too in terms of how they were constructed and their drainage systems, they said. The company also makes the case that its new proposals are more sustainable, cutting down on carbon emissions and air pollution from the heavy machinery needed to reprofile the land while delivering ""a more interesting and naturally biodiverse landscape"". Estimates vary as to how much removing the tips and filling the void would cost, ranging from £50m to £175m. ""The most recently published company accounts... (March 2025) include provision of some £91.2m for meeting the requirements of the approved restoration scheme,"" the council notes in a recent letter to the firm. But there now ""appears to be a reliance"" on the company using funds from a £15m account set up jointly with the council as a backup in case the firm went bust. The mine's consultants respond, saying detailed costings ""are currently being prepared"". Last year the Senedd's environment committee described oversight of Ffos-y-Fran coalmine as "" "", which now threatened to leave ""a permanent scar"" above Merthyr Tydfil. Campaigners have urged the Welsh government to take over the decision-making process. But in emails, officials noted ""the possible consequences of such action, including the risk of site abandonment"". They had written to the council in August requesting further information. ""Given the level of risk... we are mindful of the need to ensure we provide a robust evidence base to the Welsh ministers to underpin any options they may wish to pursue,"" the email says. Ms Jewell, a Senedd member for South East Wales, said the Welsh government had a ""moral obligation to the safety of the residents of Merthyr Tydfil"" and should intervene. In a statement Merthyr South Wales Ltd said it was ""particularly disappointed"" by Ms Jewell's comments, which they said risked ""undermining confidence in the planning system by introducing political pressure into what must remain an evidence-based determination"". ""Merthyr South Wales Ltd remains fully committed to cooperating with the planning authority and has every confidence that the application will be determined lawfully, impartially, and based on professionally verified facts, records and recommendations,"" it said. The council said it would undertake a further consultation once it receives extra information from the developer. The Welsh government said it was working with the council and other partners ""to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved for local people"", and said the case remained ""under active consideration for call-in by the Welsh ministers"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62vzw30y0qo
2025-12-02,New lease for recycling and waste disposal site,science,BBC,"A recycling point on the Isle of Man has been granted a new 25-year lease, taking effect in April 2026.

2025-12-03,Villagers 'still anxious of storms' a decade on,science,BBC,"Residents in a village in the east of the Isle of Man remain anxious of storms a decade after a major flood washed away part of a bridge, leaving a double-decker bus in a river,  a politician for the area has said. Garff MHK Andrew Smith has lived on Glen Road in the eastern village of Laxey for almost 40 years, and has seen it hit by severe flooding three times in the last 20. When Storm Desmond hit the Isle of Man on 3 December 2015, heavy rain caused a landslide and flooded a number of roads and buildings, including causing extensive damage to the National Sports Centre in Douglas. But it was the collapse of a 200-year-old bridge that saw the bus left partially submerged in Laxey river that dominated Manx headlines at the time. The driver of the bus managed to escape before it fell into the water, with no passengers on board. Smith said following that major storm in 2015 an online ""flood hub"" had been established for people to report issues and get information, and a group of local volunteers in the village had come together to from an action group. He said that while a number of positive changes had been made, there was ""still some anxiety out there when a major storm is forecast"". But the action group was there to ""respond quickly"", he said, and volunteers were ""always on call"" to offer comfort to those residents with advice or helping with sandbags. ""If there's any anxiety there then we make sure we're there to offer assistance,"" he said. In 2019, Laxey was hit again by flooding that led to a , leaving some residents temporarily trapped and causing severe damage to many homes along Glen Road. Smith conceded the village was prone to flash flooding ""because of its position beneath Snaefell"". But he said the 2015 floods were ""critical"" to a number of improvements that have been made over the past decade. ""We have to recognise that there are increased weather patterns that cross the island now,"" Smith said, adding that there was ""a need for ongoing maintenance"". He said he was ""thinking about it all the time"" and the flood action group was ""continually checking what we'd class as pinch points"". Over the past decade, he said, the infrastructure department had been ""much more active in addressing flooding issues"". and a wall was constructed lining the river where it was previously exposed. Smith said the events in 2015 highlighted the significant need for ""ongoing maintenance"", especially with traditional infrastructure. ""There was a major learning curve because we talk about maintenance, which was fundamental really,"" he said. Although there would still be inevitable anxiety in the area ahead of bad weather, the volunteers would continue ""to do everything we can to help so we keep people and property as safe as we can"", he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk7nkk1vjeo

In August Cambridge City Council was criticised after it said a had been taken away as part of a trial aimed at ensuring they were ""in the right place, are the right size and are emptied at the right frequency"". But the council now said this was ""incorrect"", adding: ""No underused bins have been removed to date."" Tim Bick, the leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition to the Labour-run council, said in August he felt the authority's move was ""pretty dangerous"". A council spokesman said it was currently reviewing the provision of bins across Cambridge. In response to the mistake, Bick said the council had cut staff emptying the bins by more than 20% this year. ""This is exactly the shrink-flation of services I've been talking about, which wasn't what Labour bosses promised,"" he said. As well as the mistake on the underused bins claim, the council also admitted making an error in a Freedom of Information Act (FOI) response to a member of public in which the authority said zero waste was recycled from public bins in Cambridge city centre.

2025-12-02,Why time is running out for Germany's green hydrogen industry,science,BBC,"In a spotless, hushed factory near Hamburg in northern Germany, industrial robots stand ready to assemble the components of electrolysers. These devices split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The ones manufactured by Quest One use proton exchange membranes to accomplish this. The robotic arms crafting Quest One's electrolysers are faster and more reliable than the humans they've replaced. But that speed and efficiency is not fully needed yet, as the order volume for electrolysers is far below the facility's capacity. The mismatch between supply and demand is evident from Quest One's own staffing. This Hamburg plant can support almost double the current staff. But earlier this year, the company had to lay off 20% of its workforce in Germany. ""The market itself is not picking up organically,"" acknowledges Nima Pegemanyfar, Quest One's executive vice president for customer operations. ""Demand is the problem. It's not supply."" Demand is sluggish in part because green hydrogen – hydrogen produced via electrolysis, using renewable electricity – remains pricey compared to the fossil fuels used to make other types of hydrogen. Low-emissions hydrogen production makes up less than 1% of hydrogen production globally. This includes both green hydrogen and blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas with the resulting carbon dioxide captured and stored. Scaling up would help bring down the costs of green hydrogen, but many projects remain small-scale. Quest One is hoping that production of green hydrogen will eventually cost €4 ($4.60; £3.50) per kilogram – about half of the current price in Germany, according to the company. The gap is not only between supply and demand. There may also be a disconnect between the sectors where green hydrogen is most badly needed (for instance, for high-temperature uses in the chemical, steel and shipping industries) and the use cases that are less competitive, but still generate chatter. Christian Stöcker, a communication professor at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, is frustrated at the attention paid to hydrogen for heating buildings and powering cars. These would be extremely inefficient, he points out, in comparison to heat pumps and electrification. Prof Stöcker is also concerned about green hydrogen's links to fossil fuel companies and automakers. Some critics argue that these companies have an interest in finding uses for, or justifying, fossil fuel infrastructure. Quest One is part of the Volkswagen Group, which reportedly is considering selling the company it owns (Everllence) that in turn owns Quest One. Volkswagen would not confirm or deny this to the BBC, or specify whether it had any other plans related to green hydrogen. A spokesperson states, ""We are currently reviewing strategic options for Everllence."" Making prices more competitive will depend on government policy, German green hydrogen companies say. Other than regulation supporting this sector, there's no plan B. And then all the infrastructure and investment will stand wasted. That infrastructure includes a network of hydrogen pipelines planned for northern Germany, snaking out from the Port of Hamburg to a number of hydrogen producers and – it is hoped – industrial clients. The infrastructure also includes salt caverns to store hydrogen underground, which Storengy Deutschland is building around an existing site for storing natural gas in Lower Saxony. The company believes that the best way to store excess renewable electricity is to convert it into hydrogen, store it at least 1,000 metres underground, then use it in winter when the need is greatest. It's a long and costly process, and regular operations wouldn't start until the 2030s at the earliest. Also being planned, for greater supply, are hydrogen transport networks between Germany and places as distant as India, Saudi Arabia, Chile and Namibia. Hydrogen gas can be converted into ammonia and then transported as a liquid. However, there are efficiency losses, including when extracting the hydrogen on the receiving end. There are also criticisms of the potential carving up of ecologically or culturally significant locations abroad to feed European industries. This could exacerbate the gap in energy access between the countries supplying and consuming hydrogen. The German government has stated that hydrogen is necessary for reaching climate targets. But amid high costs it is loosening its ambitions for green hydrogen. Yet many green hydrogen companies in Germany are calling for more government support to domestic industries and energy stability in competition with China, the world's powerhouse of green hydrogen production. Chinese companies account for almost 60% of the world's capacity to manufacture electrolysers. Overall, Ivana Jemelkova, CEO of the industry group Hydrogen Council, admits that demand for green hydrogen is not in line with the very high expectations of five years ago. In the last 18 months, 52 low-carbon and renewable hydrogen projects were cancelled, she says. ""That's a lot of bad news."" The project cancellations, delays and bankruptcies continue to mount. For instance, in May 2025, the Norwegian renewable energy company Statkraft decided to stop developing new green hydrogen projects, due to market uncertainty. A spokesperson says that the company will focus on fewer technologies going forward. But ""while some of the individual trees may be falling…the forest, as such, is really growing,"" Ms Jemelkova believes. ""It's not hype anymore. But it's not doom and gloom."" For the German companies standing ready to produce, store and move green hydrogen, it's now crunch time. They can't wait any longer for a supportive market, some say.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze60epnde0o
2025-12-03,Trump administration to roll back fuel economy rules set under Biden,science,BBC,"The US is set to loosen its fuel economy rules, reversing another Biden-era policy that had been expected to lead to increased take-up of electric cars. US President Donald Trump announced the proposal at the White House, where officials said the prior standards were not realistically achievable and were driving up costs for buyers. ""They were horrible what they were doing to costs – and actually making the cars much worse,"" Trump said. Ford chief executive Jim Farley, a car industry leader on hand to celebrate the announcement, called the change a ""victory of common sense"", while environmental groups criticised it as a step backward for the industry and public health. Transportation is the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, accounting for more than 28% of the total in 2022, according to the Department of Energy. The previous policy required carmakers to reach fuel efficiency of about 50 miles per US gallon across their fleet by model year 2031, compared to the industry average of about 27 miles per US gallon today. For passenger cars, that meant increasing efficiency by about 2% per year. Instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration less stringent standards that would lead to fuel efficiency of roughly 34.5 miles per US gallon by model year 2031. It is also moving to end a programme that had allowed carmakers to pay rivals with better fuel efficiency, like Tesla, for credits that would bring them into compliance with the rules – a policy that the administration said had ""artificially propped up the EV industry"". Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All director Katherine Garcia said the changes would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions and higher fuel costs for families. ""This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,"" she said in a statement. But Mr Farley, of Ford, said the new rules were ""aligned with customer demand"" and called the change ""the right move for a lot of reasons"". When announced last year, the Biden administration had as an effort to reduce the dependence on foreign oil, help car-owners save on fuel costs and combat pollution. It was expected to prevent more than 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Carmakers were free to use whatever technology they wanted to meet the new standard. In practice, however, achieving the target was expected to depend heavily on increased sales of electric cars. That drew pushback from some carmakers, who were already starting to scale back some investments in electric cars in response to uncertain demand. The big three US carmakers, Stellantis, General Motors and Ford, which are known for sales of bigger cars like trucks and SUVs, have the least fuel efficient fleets in the industry, If electric car sales did not increase enough, General Motors feared it would have to shut down factories making less efficient cars to comply with the Biden-era rules, GM chief executive Mary Barra said at a New York Times event on Wednesday. The plan is still subject to a formal rule-making process. Trump said his administration expected the change to help save buyers about $1,000 on the price of a car. The Biden administration had estimated that its rules would save car-owners roughly $600 on fuel over the life of their vehicles. Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the new plan would only benefit the oil industry. ""Gutting fuel economy under the pretense of safety and affordability is a cruel joke for American drivers,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly13we8zxeo
2025-12-03,Rare cottonweed returned to beachfront,science,BBC,"An endangered plant species is being reintroduced to a beachfront common where it was first recorded more than 400 years ago.

In recent years the plant has been in severe decline and is only found in Wexford, Ireland, having previously been widespread across the UK and Ireland. Natural England is reintroducing the plant on Sinah Common, a site of special scientific interest on Hayling Island as part of its threatened species recovery actions programme. The Rare British Plants Nursery - a specialist nursery which cultivates some of the rarest, most threatened native plants for habitat restoration schemes - grew hundreds of young cottonweed specimens from the Wexford plants. The sturdy plants have now been planted along Sinah Common and are expected to thrive, setting seed and becoming a self-sustaining feature of the Hayling Island coastline. Natural England is due to undertake annual monitoring to see how the plants progress. Seventeenth century naturalist John Goodyer noted its location as ""on the seashoare on the south parte of the Iland of Haylinge"". Havant Borough Council lead member for the environment Grainne Rason said: ""Over 400 years ago, Hayling Island was home to Cottonweed and I now take great pride in the fact that it will be a focal point for its reintroduction into our impressive natural shoreline. ""Through partnership, hard work and dedication to a noble cause, it is plain to see we can have a positive impact on our environment when we put our minds to it.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjg6x5v1xo
2025-12-01,"Real anxiety among farmers over bluetongue virus, minister says",science,BBC,"There are ""very serious"" consequences for the agri-community in Northern Ireland if bluetongue virus gets hold, the agriculture minister has said. Spread by midges, bluetongue (BTV-3) poses no threat to the public or food safety but can affect cloven-hoofed animals like sheep and cattle. The Department of Agriculture, Environment Rural Affairs (Daera) said surveillance at an abattoir indicated the presence of the disease in two cows from a farm near Bangor, County Down. . Minister Andrew Muir said ""it's really important to have vigilance around this"". He urged farmers to report it urgently and isolate infected animals if they see signs of infection. ""While this does not have an impact on public health and food safety, it has potentially very serious consequences on agri-food and has caused real anxiety within the farming community."" , the minister encouraged farmers to get their animals vaccinated, but added that it was their choice. ""If it was me, as a farmer, I would be taking that up, but it's for others to make their own decisions on individual circumstances around this,"" he said. ""The level of uptake has been relatively low. It's largely farmers who have got very high value livestock who have decided to use the vaccine."" Clandeboye Estate told BBC News NI that ""a routine test confirmed the possible presence of the bluetongue antibodies in two animals that had formerly been part of the Clandeboye herd"". They said Daera was notified immediately and they were ""working closely with their veterinary team to carry out further investigations"". ""The bluetongue virus does not affect humans and has no impact on dairy products or food safety generally,"" they said. ""Consistent with our continued commitment to the highest standards in terms of both food production and the welfare of our animals we will be carrying out further testing over the next few days."" On Monday afternoon, Muir told the assembly that the best way to secure the future of agrifood industry against the bluetongue virus is by ""moving fast and hard"" against it. The minister was asked about compensation and said it would be considered on a ""case-by-case basis"". He added that if bluetongue-positive animals were culled, compensation would be paid at 50% of market value. ""This is a threat to our agrifood industry and it's important we respond accordingly,"" he said, pointing to a control zone now in place. Ian Buchanan, a sheep, beef and dairy farmer based outside Dungiven, County Londonderry, said there was ""a state of shock"" among the farming community. ""With the cold weather here at the moment and there being few midges around, we hope there isn't much spread and that it can be contained,"" he said. programme that sheep would be very seriously affected by this disease. ""Sheep can die from it, and in the Netherlands a lot of sheep died in 2023, which was the first outbreak in Europe for quite some time,"" he added. William Irvine, from the Ulster Farmers' Union, said they were very concerned. ""We were hopeful that we had escaped it for the season, but just on the last lap it has appeared and all precautions now need to be taken,"" he said. Mr Irvine said that the vaccination has not been widely taken up by farmers and is ""quite expensive"", but added that this is a ""game changer now"". ""Now that it's on the island of Ireland, they are very concerned, and I imagine they will be organising the availability of vaccines for their farmers,"" he said. Moves of species susceptible to bluetongue on or off premises within the TCZ are prohibited while officials carry out further investigations. A general licence is available that allows animals to cross the boundary if they are going directly to slaughter. Dr Mike Reynolds, a senior clinical director at CVS Farm Vets NI, said there is a ""real and present"" danger following the discovery. ""I think it shouldn't be underestimated that level of anxiety within the farming community,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""Because these outbreaks do result in prolonged restrictions on movement and trade, and obviously have financial impacts on business, but also has to be taken into consideration farmer's concerns for their livestock and the disease incursions."" He said that vaccines cost about £2.50 per dose, and encouraged livestock farmers to ""consider and discuss"" their use. The Chair of Medicines at Veterinary Ireland Conor Geraghty told RTÉ that he's concerned about bluetongue spreading to the Republic of Ireland. ""The theory is that if it's not contained in Northern Ireland, it would spread during the fly season late next spring and early summer,"" he said. He added that the vaccine is not currently available in the Republic. Ireland's Minister for Agriculture Martin Heydon said it could have ""potentially serious implications"" if the virus spreads across the border. ""If the disease becomes established in one part of the island, it will be that much easier for it to spread, with consequences for animal health and welfare, and financial and emotional stress for farmers."" Bluetongue virus affects cattle, goats, sheep, deer and camelids such as llamas and alpacas. It can cause ulcers or sores around the animal's mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness, foetal deformities and stillbirths. The latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep died, and midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south-east of England too. But the impact of BTV-3 seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection and managing to recover. It is a notifiable disease so anyone suspecting their animals may have it must report it to a vet, local divisional veterinary office or to Daera directly. Biting midges are most active from April to November and the potential for spread depends on climatic conditions and wind patterns with lower temperatures significantly reducing the risk, the department said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvj5jv51eo
2025-11-30,"More than 400 killed in Indonesia flooding, officials say",science,BBC,"The death toll from flooding and landslides on Indonesia's Sumatra island has risen dramatically to 442, officials say. The total passed 300 earlier on Sunday, with evacuation efforts under way, major roads cut off, and internet and electricity only partially restored. Monsoons exacerbated by tropical storms have caused some of the worst flooding in years across South East Asia. Hundreds are dead and missing in Malaysia and Thailand as well, with millions affected across the region. The official death toll in Thailand currently sits at 170, with two deaths reported in Malaysia's northern Perlis state. Elsewhere, there have been nearly 160 deaths in Sri Lanka due to a bout of particularly extreme weather that has caused flooding and mudslides. An exceptionally rare tropical storm, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged. ""The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,"" a resident in Indonesia's Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: ""It's already sunk."" After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was ""swept away by the current"" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued. ""During the flood, everything was gone,"" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told news agency Reuters. ""I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down."" The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said. In Tapanuli, the worst-affected area, residents have reportedly ransacked shops in search of food. Pressure is mounting on Jakarta to declare a national disaster in Sumatra to enable a faster and more co-ordinated response. In Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade. Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 3.8 million people have been affected, the government said on Saturday. The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day last week - the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, workers were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported. ""We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,"" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai. The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that had lost family members. In neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating. Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of Perlis state underwater, with tens of thousands forced into shelters. , with at least 193 people killed and more than 200 missing, according to the Disaster Management Centre. Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters of recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency. More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water. Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto - which has crossed over the Philippines and is now heading towards Vietnam - and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait. Three people have already been killed and another is missing in Vietnam due to the effects of the approaching Typhoon Koto, news agency AFP reports. The region's monsoon seasons often bring heavy rain. While it is hard to link individual extreme weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making storms more frequent and intense, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9ejley9do
2025-11-30,Recycling centre to move for railway upgrade work,science,BBC,"A waste and recycling centre in Dewsbury is to be relocated from one side of its current site to the other so work can be carried out on a nearby railway track. It comes after the council-run Weaving Lane site was acquired by Network Rail as part of its multibillion-pound Transpennine route upgrade. The firm said the move was necessary so engineers could access the railway line to build a new retaining wall and create space for new tracks. The centre was expected to be closed on Sunday 30 November while containers and facilities were moved to the other side of the current site, and it was due to reopen in its new location on Monday 1 December, according to Kirklees Council. Access to the new location would still be through Thornhill Road and Weaving Lane, but visitors would need to turn left after the entrance gates instead of right, a council spokesperson said. Tyler Hawkins, cabinet member for highways and waste, said: ""This has been a fantastic opportunity to deliver real improvements to recycling facilities in Kirklees. ""The new layout will provide a more accessible facility over two levels with additional parking, making it much easier and safer for the public to access the containers and dispose of their household waste."" Andrew Campbell, Transpennine route upgrade sponsor, said the work would enable the firm ""to press ahead with plans to install more tracks throughout this section of railway and beyond so that faster, more frequent, services can run in the future. ""The Transpennine route upgrade will deliver improved rail journeys across the North, and our ongoing collaboration with Kirklees Council is vital.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0kg488188o

2025-12-01,Royal curtains recycled into Christmas stockings,science,BBC,"Curtains that once graced the windows of a royal retreat have been turned into Christmas stockings to be auctioned for charity. Drapes from Sandringham House in Norfolk have been recycled into 25 stockings by a sewing bee group. Its members meet at Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland, where charity The King's Foundation is based, which will get the money raised. Sarah McClymont, 31, lead tutor with the bee, said: ""Being given the opportunity to work with such historically significant fabric was a real honour for them and they are so proud of how the stockings turned out."" One stocking will be given to King Charles III as a Christmas present, while the other 24 will be auctioned for the charity. The King's Foundation provides opportunities for people to learn practical heritage skills and focuses on sustainability. Ms McClymont said the bee's latest project ""demonstrates The King's Foundation's commitment to craftsmanship, responsible design, and sustainable fashion and textiles"". ""We hope that whoever is lucky enough to win one of the stockings at auction will pass it down as a family heirloom to be treasured for decades to come,"" she added. Members of the group spent six hours crafting each stocking, using hand embroidery, piping and seam-matching skills. Christine Wilson, 72, and Andrea Middlemiss, 63, from the nearby town of Cumnock, had never sewn before joining the group. Retired finance officer Ms Wilson joined when the bee was first set up, and cafe worker Ms Middlemiss signed up six months later. ""Over the years we've done a lot of different ideas, and we've learned so much from the tutors,"" said Ms Wilson. ""They've been excellent. It's a great community-based organisation."" Her friend, Ms Middlemiss, said she now knows how to make dresses and jackets, and described the latest commission as an ""honour"".

2025-12-01,Council publicly opposes solar farm plans,science,BBC,"A council has publicly declared its opposition to a proposed solar farm, saying it would ""disrupt local life"" and ""deliver little real benefit"" to residents. Whitestone Solar Farm wants to install solar panels on three sites in South Yorkshire, one of which is just outside of Conisbrough, capable of powering 250,000 homes. However, a motion tabled by City of Doncaster Council's Reform UK councillor Rachel Reed calling on the developers to withdraw its plan and scale back any future proposal was passed with cross-party support. A spokesperson for Whitestone said: ""We are currently reviewing the feedback we received and working to update our proposals to address issues wherever possible."" , Reed said: ""This is a clear win for our community, which has stood together to challenge a development that is simply the wrong project in the wrong place. ""Whitestone would damage green space, disrupt local life, and deliver little real benefit to Doncaster. Councillors have recognised that, and [this] vote sends a strong message: our area will not be taken for granted."" Responding to the council's motion, a spokesperson for Whitestone Solar Farm said: ""Whitestone Solar Farm is a proposed solar development that is still in early stages of development. ""We have just completed our statutory consultation, a six-week period during which we met with hundreds of local residents and received thousands of pieces of feedback."" They said the project would include a ""community benefit package"" worth £300,000 a year for the local area. Defence Secretary John Healey, MP for Rawmarsh & Conisbrough, has also opposed the plan and called it the ""wrong scheme in the wrong place"". However, due to the solar farm being a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, the final decision will be decided by the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero – Doncaster North MP Ed Miliband. City of Doncaster Council has previously suggested solar infrastructure should be installed on rooftops and brownfield land, rather than agricultural land. Whitestone said: ""In order to meet national targets for renewable energy, large scale projects like Whitestone are needed, however, we also continue to support the rooftop revolution and continue to develop our rooftop solar business.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdrxegegk3o

2025-12-01,Energy firm wins battery plant appeal,science,BBC,"An energy company can build a battery storage plant at a farm in West Yorkshire after winning its appeal against a decision to refuse planning permission. In July, Wakefield Council turned down YLEM Energy's application to install 24 containerised battery units at Cooksland Farm, near Normanton, stating it was inappropriate use of green belt land. But an appeal by the firm to the Planning Inspectorate argued the site should be redefined as what is known as ""grey belt"", a category of land including low quality or underused areas within existing green belt land. An inspector's report agreed the site could be considered grey belt land and said the proposal ""would not be inappropriate"". as part of an overhaul of the planning system designed to free up some green belt areas for development. The government had previously described the grey belt as ""poor quality and ugly areas"" on parts of protected land. , the proposed Battery Energy Storage System on a 2.5 acre (one hectare) site at Old Snydale would harness power from renewable energy sources and then release it back to the National Grid when demand was high. At least 100 village residents had objected to the plan at the time it was turned down, with 10 public comments of support submitted in favour of the facility. At that time, councillors were urged to reject the scheme by former Super League referee Ben Thaler, who spoke on behalf of residents opposed to the plan and who told a meeting at Wakefield Town Hall that the application posed ""unacceptable risks to public safety, infrastructure and local well-being"". The scheme would also cause ""severe and prolonged"" disruption, including ""road closures, noise pollution and safety concerns"",  Mr Thaler told the meeting. Meanwhile, supporters of the scheme said it was ""important to embrace new technology to help switch to renewable energy"". Addressing concerns, the inspector said that while a level of noise and disturbance was ""inevitable"", additional details were to be agreed ""through a construction and environmental management plan, prior to any work commencing on site"". A statement previously submitted on behalf of the company said ""limited harm to the green belt"" was ""clearly outweighed by the acute need for renewable energy infrastructure and technology"". An inspector's report published on Friday said: ""Taken together, the appeal site can be considered grey belt land and, as such, the proposal would not be inappropriate development in the green belt.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd2g2842yo
2025-12-01,I have high levels of forever chemicals in my blood - what can I do about it?,science,BBC,"As I walked into the medical clinic for my blood test, all I could think about was how to avoid looking like a wimp on camera. I didn't really contemplate what the test would reveal. I am not great with needles - but as part of a BBC Panorama investigation into so-called forever chemicals, I was being tested to see what level of them I had in my blood. As a mum with two small children, I also wanted to know whether they may be having an impact on my family. Forever chemicals, or PFAS (per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances), are a group of about 10,000 chemicals. They have been used for decades, in anything from waterproof clothes, to cookware, electronics and medical equipment. They are persistent pollutants, meaning they don't degrade easily and instead build up in the environment. They exist in our homes, our water and in our food. Scientists have linked a small number of them to serious harms, such as infertility and cancer. Any level of PFAS above 2ng (nanograms) per millilitre of blood is considered to bring health risks, according to Dr Sabine Donnai, a specialist in preventative healthcare. She has never met anyone without at least some PFAS in their bloodstream. My result was 9.8ng per millilitre. Dr Donnai delivered the news very gently - but it still hit me hard. The forever chemicals in my blood would ""most likely"" have an impact on my health, she told me. I also learned that, sadly, my body would have rid itself of some of these chemicals during pregnancy, by passing it on to my babies. That was the moment this investigation stopped being just work and felt very personal. ""They [PFAS levels] would have been even higher before your pregnancies,"" Dr Donnai told me. ""You will have passed on to your children for sure."" I was worried, but I also felt angry about how this could have happened without me having any knowledge, and very little control. I wanted to know more about these substances and the health issues they have been linked to. PFAS chemicals ""don't break down"", said Stephanie Metzger from the Royal Society of Chemistry. ""Once they get into our bodies, they stick around and build up little-by-little until they start to interfere with our systems. ""Some PFAS have been linked to thyroid problems, some to kidney and liver cancer, and some have been shown to affect fertility."" As for me, it is ""unlikely"" I will be able to bring my levels to zero, said Dr Donnai. ""But you can reduce it over the next two or three years with a strategy."" She suggested I increase my fibre intake - either by eating more oats, barley, beans, nuts and seeds, or by taking supplements of gel-forming fibre. Increased fibre in our diet is ""the strongest evidence to date that might help"", she said. If I did these things, menstruation would also help reduce my current PFAS levels over time, she added. She also told me to identify the biggest sources of exposure in my home - replace my non-stick cookware with ceramic, stainless steel or cast iron alternatives, use a water filter and switch to eco-friendly cleaning products which are transparent about being PFAS-free. Look for PFAS-free make-up and hair products and avoid ingredients with ""fluoro"" or ""PTFE"" in the name, she added. Similar advice was given to mum-to-be Pam Kavanagh, who we visited at home in Berkshire with Dr Federica Amati of Imperial College London. Pam was eager to know how to reduce the possible household risks of PFAS to her baby - and Dr Amati has studied how babies and children can be affected by forever chemicals. ""When we drink tap water, we are, depending on where you live, at varying levels of exposure to PFAS,"" Dr Amati said. Just buying a water filter can help to reduce exposure, she said - whether that is a jug with a filter in it, or a filter installed into the actual sink. Any non-stick frying pans with scratches on them should be thrown out, Dr Amati advised. Stainless steel or ceramic pans ""are far safer"", she said. Carpets can be treated with PFAS to make them more stain resistant, she added, suggesting that people vacuum their carpets every day. ""Making sure you ventilate the room by opening the windows every single day is a good idea [because] it really collects as house dust,"" she added Dr Amati then turned to children's clothing. Pam was left ""speechless"" to discover that waterproof or stain-resistant clothing can contain PFAS. Manufacturers are under no obligation to disclose this information. Some children's products are not PFAS-free, despite claiming to be, the BBC learned. We found PFAS in a children's coat we bought from the Mountain Warehouse website a few months ago, even though the site says that none of its children's products are made with forever chemicals. The jacket we tested came from a small batch of old stock, made more than three years ago, Mountain Warehouse told the BBC. Although the coat ""meets UK safety standards"", it added, the product has now been withdrawn from sale. The company said it was working ""to eliminate PFAS from all products as soon as possible"" and that ""children's clothing manufactured since 2023 is PFAS-free"". If fabrics containing PFAS come into ""prolonged contact with human skin"" there's the potential the chemicals can be absorbed across the skin, explained Prof Stuart Harrad at the University of Birmingham, who tested the coat for us. To reduce the risk, opt for untreated fabrics and avoid ""waterproof"" or ""stain-repellent"" labels unless they have a PFAS-free certification, said Dr Donnai. Our greatest exposure to forever chemicals comes from food - particularly fish, meat, eggs, fruit and fruit products, according to the European Food Safety Authority. An innocent-looking strawberry could have PFAS exposure, I learned, because the chemicals can be added to pesticides ""to help them stick better to the fruit, so when it rains it doesn't wash off"", explained Prof David Megson of Manchester Metropolitan University. Of the assortment of picnic items we laid out, a bottle of wine could carry the greatest PFAS risk, Prof Megson told me. ""We concentrate hundreds of grapes into each bottle. As the wider pesticide breaks down, the PFAS bit is left behind,"" he said. PFAS chemicals are so embedded in modern life that none of us can fully escape them. They have made our lives convenient and our products durable - but at a potential cost we are only now beginning to count. The European Commission is consulting on an outright ban on about 10,000 PFAS chemicals. The UK government says it is looking to ban or restrict some chemicals but has not committed to a blanket ban. It told us that it is ""working at pace with regulators to assess levels of PFAS in the environment, their sources and potential risks"" to inform its approach to ""policy and regulation"". PFAS chemicals have many essential uses, and safer substitutes are not yet available, argues the Chemical Industries Association. It says ""regulators and industry need to work together in setting transition periods"" to bring alternatives to market. When I first had the blood tests, I thought it would provide an interesting scene for our documentary. But once you know these chemicals are inside you, you can't unknow it. Having a plan to reduce my exposure is a small comfort. But I'll be honest, it is also another thing to worry about.

Ships were expected in Sibolga on Monday, he added. Some foreign aid has arrived, with Malaysia sending medical supplies to Aceh, one of the worst-hit provinces. In Sungai Nyalo village, about 100km (62 miles) from West Sumatra's capital Padang, floodwaters had mostly receded on Sunday, leaving homes, vehicles and crops coated in thick grey mud, AFP reports. The authorities had not yet begun clearing roads, residents said, and no outside assistance had arrived. ""Most villagers chose to stay; they didn't want to leave their houses behind,"" Idris, 55, told the news agency. Police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said there were reports of people breaking into shops on Sumatra, and police had been sent in to restore order, the Associated Press news agency reported. ""The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,"" Mr Walintukan added. ""Residents] didn't know that aid would come and were worried they would starve."" In another development, tech billionaire Elon Musk said he would provide free Starlink services to support communications during the emergency. There has been widespread devastation across the region. At least 170 people died in floods in and there were several deaths reported in , more than 330 people died from floods and mudslides as the country grappled with one of its worst weather disasters in years. While the torrential rains have now subsided, low-lying areas of the capital, Colombo, are still flooded and many areas in the centre of the country remain cut off. , tens of thousands of people joined protests against government corruption on Sunday, for the second time this month, following a series of disastrous floods which killed more than 200 people. The government has acknowledged that substantial funds meant to finance flood control have been lost through corruption. Public anger over the issue now threatens the administration of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. There were two large protests in the capital Manila, one organised by the Roman Catholic Church and the other by unions, students and left-wing activists. Their complaint is the same – that money designated by the central government for flood defences was diverted into the pockets of corrupt politicians, leaving many communities dangerously exposed to this year's exceptionally heavy rainfall. But determining who is responsible is proving harder. Marcos Jr has sacked several politicians and officials he blames for stealing flood funds. However, one of those politicians, who is now in hiding, has accused the president himself of supervising the corruption - Marcos Jr has dismissed that as propaganda. His own sister, Senator Imee Marcos, has now joined opposition to him, and Vice-President Sara Duterte, a bitter rival of the president, says she is ready to take over should he be forced to resign. However, she too faces different corruption allegations. Much now depends on whether the protests continue in the coming weeks and whether any more of the president's allies desert him. He will be mindful that two of his predecessors, including his father, were ousted by popular protest movements stirred up by corruption.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz82z7p8zo
2025-11-28,Council opposes turbines near mountain bike trails,science,BBC,"A council has agreed to object to plans for a wind farm near to one of a series of mountain bike centres across the south of Scotland. Scottish Power Renewables wants to build 12 turbines as part of its Harestanes West wind farm close to the 7Stanes site at the Forest of Ae north of Dumfries. However, Dumfries and Galloway Council's planning committee decided to oppose the project as a ""very poor fit"" for the surrounding landscape. The final decision on whether the scheme can go ahead will lie with the Scottish government. Councillors were told the wind farm had a lot of elements in its favour in terms of helping to meet renewable energy targets and economic benefits. They heard it could meet the energy needs of more than 46,000 homes. A planning report said that did not outweigh its adverse impact and recommended the local authority lodge an objection. It said the wind farm would be ""overly dominant"" in the forest which would affect recreational visitors including those using the mountain bike trails. It added that due to their size the turbines would be ""discordant and confusing"" and also raised concerns about the impact of aviation lighting which would be required. A spokesperson for Scottish Power Renewables said: ""We note the objection of Dumfries and Galloway Council and are disappointed with this decision. ""Harestanes West wind farm has the potential to deliver significant economic and community benefits for the region and would play an important role in providing part of the green electricity needed for the government's clean power ambitions.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d9p2zj508o

2025-11-29,Which are the best west coast ferries to spot whales and dolphins?,science,BBC,"Ferry passengers on Scotland's west coast often celebrate spotting wildlife in the waves as they travel between the Hebdrides and the mainland. But conservationists also use the network of CalMac ferry routes to gain insight into the lives of native whales and dolphins. For six months every year volunteers from the charity ORCA carry out surveys from the boats. The results of this year's research show which species are making their homes in Scottish waters and which ferries people are most likely to spot them from. The publicly-owned ferry company operates in the Firth of Clyde, Argyll and Bute and the Western Isles. Its boats sail to about 30 destinations, including Arran, Lewis and Harris, and the tiny isle of Eigg in the Small Isles. Almost 40 ORCA volunteer marine mammal surveyors were involved in 37 surveys that were carried out between March and October across seven different routes. A few surveys were cancelled due to bad weather, and no studies were done on the Ardrossan-Campbeltown route. CalMac said ORCA still managed to conduct the most surveys on the highest number of different routes since the studies started in 2017. Volunteers travelled a total distances of 3,423 miles (5,509km) during the research. This year's survey recorded 1,589 individual animals - almost double that of 2024. ORCA said this could be because of the increased effort made in 2025 to spot sea life. Ten different marine species were seen - two less than last year - and they included whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sharks. were the most frequently recorded, with 1,147 individual animals seen. This was more than double the number recorded in 2024. sightings - 73 in 2025 compared with 20 in 2024.

It said further research would be needed. were among other animals spotted. ORCA said the ""high density"" marine wildlife areas seem to have shifted north to the Uig-Lochmaddy-Tarbert and the Ullapool-Stornoway routes - a trend first noticed last year. On Uig-Lochmaddy-Tarbert, minke whale were spotted and 25 common dolphins swimming together in a ""super pod"". On the route between Ullapool and Stornoway, there was an occasion when 13 harbour porpoise were seen. Spotted on the route at various times were common dolphin super pods numbering between 13 and 30.

Fingal County Council has issued an appeal for information after the headless body of the stag, that was part of a herd at Newbridge Demesne, Donabate in County Dublin, was found by staff on Thursday. The stag's head was removed from the grounds and staff say they have no doubt it was taken as a trophy, Irish broadcaster RTÉ is reporting. Gardaí (Irish police) confirmed they are investigating a reported incident of wildlife crime. ""It had been killed overnight [on Wednesday] by intruders who had broken into the park. The discovery was made when staff went to feed the herd of Irish Red Deer,"" Fingal County Council said in a statement. The stag, who was eight years old, was one of two in the herd. The killing of the stag is also under investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Mayor of Fingal, councillor Tom O'Leary, condemned the killing. He said: ""I have visited this park area with my granddaughters who really enjoyed meeting the stag and deer.  A wonderful animal to behold close up. ""It's truly shocking that someone would carry out this act,"" he said. ""I am appealing to anybody with information to contact the gardaí or the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It is illegal to kill deer without a licence and I hope that the perpetrators can be brought to justice."" Ivan Smith, foreman of Works at Newbridge House and Traditional Farm, said the team was ""absolutely shocked"" by the incident. ""He was a lovely stag with a beautiful pair of antlers and was a big favourite with the public who walk through the park."" Ireland's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) have expressed ""horror"" at the attack. ""The unnecessary killing of such a majestic creature for, what appears to be, a trophy is appalling,"" Pat Watt of the NSPCA said.

2025-11-28,Dumfries flood protection scheme costs reach £68m,science,BBC,"The costs of a project to protect a flood-prone part of Dumfries have risen to £68.6m. The last estimated price of the Whitesands scheme in 2023 stood at a little over half that figure - £37.5m. A report to councillors said a council investment of £13.7m could unlock nearly £55m in Scottish government funding. However, if the council decides not to fund the project when it meets on 11 December it will not be able to access the government support and the scheme will not proceed. To date £5m has been allocated to the project by the council and it is seeking approval of a further £8.7m when it meets next month. The council said it could revitalise the Greensands, Whitesands and Dock Park areas of Dumfries. It has blamed the increase in estimated cost on inflation and changes to the project design. Opponents have argued the cost is too high and have concerns over the loss of parking and visual impact. It will now be up to councillors to decide whether it can move forward at full council. Council convener Katie Hagmann said: ""The decision that will be made at our meeting on 11 December is crucial. ""It will determine whether the project proceeds to the next stage, subject to funding and necessary consents and it will provide certainty to the community.""

2025-11-28,Beach clean tool 'causes microplastics' say volunteers,science,BBC,"An environmental group has called on a council to rethink the way it cleans a popular tourist beach. Weymouth and Portland Marine Litter Project claims Weymouth Town Council's beach rake breaks up much of the rubbish left on the beach instead of picking it up. It says buckets and spades, dumped by tourists, are often crushed by the machinery and are a likely source of microplastics. The council said its beach cleaning machine was not responsible for microplastics and it had just agreed to spend £71,000 on a new one. Volunteers for the marine litter project carry out regular beach cleans in the evenings, recycling rubbish and saving undamaged beach toys, before the council rakes the sand in the mornings. Co-founder Dave Taylor said: ""One of the main issues is the tractor goes before the rake, so anything on the beach gets compressed by the tractor."" He claimed the mechanism of the beach rake also caused larger items such as buckets to ""shatter"". ""Since the holidays we have been finding literally hundreds of small particles of bits of beach toys,"" he said. A Weymouth Town Council spokesperson said: ""Daily raking has taken place for more than 30 years, and with thousands of visitors throughout the summer, as well as events all year round, it is vital that the beach is kept clean and safe for residents, visitors and wildlife. ""Microplastics aren't made or dropped by beach-cleaning machines. ""Special nurdle-cleaning machines can still be useful after a spill or for focused clean-ups, but they aren't a practical replacement for the equipment used to maintain the beach every day."" The council said it had taken steps to reduce microplastics and general waste, including the introduction of a water refill station, and a toy library to reduce the demand for new buckets and spades. Rick Stafford, Professor of Environmental Policy at Bournemouth University, said the broken down particles were ""more likely from waste which is washed up on to the beach from the sea"". He said: ""These rakes are quite heavy... they probably are breaking it down into smaller pieces over a considerable amount of time but the rakes are also picking up quite a lot of plastic from the beach, from what I've seen, so they are also preventing some of that plastic moving out to sea."" According to the United Nations' Environment Programme, microplastics are any fragment of plastic that is between one nanometer and five millimetres wide. One nanometre is just a fraction of the width of a human hair, and 5 millimetres is about the width of a wedding band. Most microplastics are caused by larger items, such as clothes or packaging, gradually being worn down into smaller pieces. Primary microplastics are things that are designed to be small - such as microbeads in some face washes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23en4p280eo

Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT), in Jersey, said a three-year-old male greater bamboo lemur, called Orsa, had arrived. The trust said he used to live at Cotswold Wildlife Park, and the zoo had been selected as a place to safeguard and hopefully breed the species. Georgia Gotts, deputy curator of mammals at Jersey Zoo, said: ""Greater bamboo lemurs are like the rockstars of the lemur world, due to them being incredibly rare, full of character, and adored by everyone who meets them.""

2025-11-28,At least 56 dead as severe floods hit Sri Lanka,science,BBC,"At least 56 people have been killed and 21 are missing in Sri Lanka after floods and landslides triggered by heavy rains wreaked havoc this week, in one of its worst weather related disasters the country has seen in recent years. Twenty-one people were killed in the central tea-growing district of Badulla when a landslide crashed onto their homes overnight, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said in a statement. Cyclone Ditwah brushed the island nation's eastern coast on Friday, brining more rains. Videos uploaded to social media show houses being washed away as flood waters cascade through towns, while most train services have been cancelled across the country. Ditwa began as a deep depression but later intensified into a cyclone. In Sri Lanka, river levels are continuing to rise and the DMC has warned residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground. A red level flood warning has been issued for the low-lying areas of the Kelani River valley within the next 48 hours, the Irrigation Department said. Areas at risk include the capital, Colombo. During a parliamentary session on Friday, Sri Lankan MP Ajith Perera raised concerns about an emergency situation reportedly involving a stranded bus. ""I have been getting multiple reports of a bus that has been stranded near the Kala Wewa [a major reservoir complex in central Sri Lanka] for one and a half hours,"" he said, urging the government to facilitate the approval of a helicopter to rescue the passengers. In response, Minister of Justice Harshana Nanayakkara confirmed that the bus was stranded. He told lawmakers that police had instructed the bus to halt its journey because conditions were too dangerous to continue. Armed forces had already been deployed, and a helicopter had been authorised for the rescue, he added. ""They will be rescued,"" he said. In Anuradhapura, a military helicopter conducted three operations on Friday morning to rescue people stranded by the adverse weather and the overflow of the Kala Wewa. The helicopter successfully airlifted a man who had been sheltering atop a coconut tree overnight, the Sri Lankan Air Force said. More than 200mm (7.8in) of rain is expected in some central and northern parts of the island on Friday, Sri Lanka's met office said. Key roads connecting provinces have been closed and the Railway Department has announced that all trains, except for a few essential services, have been cancelled from 06:00 on Friday. The DMC said that almost 44,000 people have been affected by the extreme weather. Around 20,500 army troops have been deployed to provide relief and rescue operations across the country. Students sitting for the Advanced Level Exams - also known as the A-levels - have also have their exams postponed as a result. Sri Lanka is currently experiencing its monsoon season but it is rare for the island to see extreme weather on this level. The worst flooding this century in Sri Lanka was in June 2003 when 254 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced. The flooding comes as South East Asia is also facing some of the worst floods the region has seen in years, with millions impacted across Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

It was brought in on 3 November for the six tips in the West Northamptonshire Council area, to ensure only waste produced by local people gets processed and to reduce queues. The Liberal Democrat group presented a petition with 700 signatures, saying there was a ""glaring lack of consultation"" and highlighted residents' worries over fly-tipping and overflowing kerbside bins. However, Reform UK council leader Mark Arnull was ""delivering some good for our residents already"".

He added it would have been ""more appropriate"" to trial booking systems at waste centres. In response, Arnull said: ""I'm not sure this petition is anything more than a load of rubbish itself. ""In week three of the booking system, 89% of the visits at the recycling centres across West Northants were from bookings, so there is a significant move there that people are adopting the system and they do understand.""

2025-11-29,'Going viral doesn't mean you're earning millions',science,BBC,"After one of her make-up products ""went viral"" on social media, people assumed Zoe Trigwell was an overnight success and a millionaire. The truth was, the business owner was paying herself a small wage to get by having been through a lot of lows. One academic said social media success stories can mask the harsh realities women  in business face, and they lack a platform to complain about how little money they make for fear of looking ""greedy"". The Welsh government said its specialist advice service Business Wales was committed to supporting female entrepreneurs. Zoe, who has two children, started Trigwell Cosmetics in 2020 after her make-up academy business shut during the Covid pandemic. Initially she bought a few products to sell to friends, family and clients, funding them by running online make-up tutorials for £2 a ticket. ""I had no idea... investment was a thing, but I had no idea where to turn to or who to ask. I don't think there's that much information out there on how to actually get investment for small businesses,"" she said. The 31-year-old said when one product went viral in 2022, people wrongly assumed she was an overnight success and millionaire. ""I paid myself a small wage just so that we could live and get by but I didn't take any massive chunks of money, especially in those days when we started go viral, because every single penny that was made had to be reinvested to keep up with the demands,"" Zoe said. She said she feels that there's a lot of pressure for female founders to be perfect and to always make perfect decisions – something she tries to challenge online. ""It's really, really important, especially for people that are wanting to become entrepreneurs, to show that it isn't all highlights and not everything is rosy, and you don't just sell out instantly. ""There's a lot of hard work and a lot of downs and negatives that do come with it,"" she said. Entrepreneur Lauren Bell said it took four years before she was able to take a salary from her business, Cosi Care. The 33-year-old created a gadget to help her brother cope with eczema, which he has had throughout his life. Lauren said: ""It's so challenging to get the big cheques. People don't support women. People almost don't believe that women can achieve what men can achieve. ""They see me in a pink suit with a nice Welsh accent, and they just don't believe that you can reach those levels."" The entrepreneur said that while she's really proud of what she's achieved as a woman in a STEM industry, it's a ""shame"" she didn't have more support in the early days. Lauren, a design graduate, has recently won a million-pound investment and will be moving the entire business to the US soon. ""I'm moving all of our employees there. I'm manufacturing in America and moving everything over to America, which is a real shame, because I did really try and do it in the UK, but there just wasn't the same scale of support for female-owned businesses,"" she said. Dr Sarah Marks from Swansea University agreed business owners are under pressure to present themselves as successful online. ""For people to really be successful and to really consider themselves as a successful entrepreneur, they actually need to be generating quite a lot of income, and my research suggests that actually the vast majority of women do not generate anywhere near what will be a market equivalent income for themselves,"" she said. The lecturer in the school of management said her research showed entrepreneurship often doesn't provide sustainable living for women, with many giving up. ""Women are actually denied a kind of platform in which to complain about how little money they're earning... they don't want to be seen as greedy; they don't want to be seen as ungrateful and that can be a real pressure for women and a real burden,"" she said. A report published last month by the Women and Equalities committee found that female entrepreneurs face significant disadvantages in accessing finances, investment networks and support systems. The cross-party group of MPs found that while numerous programmes have been established to address the issue, they have had limited effect. A spokesperson for the UK government said it was ""putting women at the heart of its grown agenda to make the UK the best place for women-led businesses by tackling barriers and unlocking opportunities for them"". ""The Invest in Women Taskforce has secured over £500m in funding for women-led businesses over the past 12 months and investment in female entrepreneurs began in August this year,"" they said. The Welsh government said since May 2021, Business Wales had supported 2,301 start-ups led by women which is ""56% of all start-ups supported"". ""The Development Bank for Wales supports female entrepreneurs via many projects, including the Women Angel of Wales syndicate which increases the activity of female angel investors"" they added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx272dj04rno
2025-11-30,Good weather gives rare butterfly species a boost,science,BBC,"A ""treasure"" of Northern Ireland's countryside has had a bumper year, thanks to warm weather and conservation efforts. The Marsh Fritillary butterfly used to be widespread across the UK and Ireland but plummeted in the last century as farming practices changed. After years of work with landowners by the charity Butterfly Conservation, the latest survey of silken caterpillar nests has seen huge increases. The charity said it showed the importance of habitat restoration, because good weather alone is not enough to reverse decades of decline. The species depends on just one plant, Devil's-bit Scabious, which grows across a range of grassland and heathland sites, most often grazed by cattle. Much of this habitat was lost over the 20th century because of changes in farming practices. As a conservation manager for Butterfly Conservation, Rose Cremin has worked with farmers across Northern Ireland to help them manage the land to support the species. That can involve advising on what to graze where and when, and how to manage grass. She said while weather is important, it is only a ""short-term influencing factor"". Because climate change could have good and negative effects on butterflies, the focus must be on habitat restoration. ""More importantly for the species survival, and for it to thrive, is really the appropriate management of land by farmers and the land managers to ensure that the habitat is right, that its food plant is there in abundance, and that the sward (grass) height suits for the female to lay its eggs."" She added that many of the farmers she works with delight in walking the farm with the conservation volunteers to see how butterflies are faring on their land. Every autumn, the charity's volunteers carry out a survey of the sites where habitat is being managed. They count the larval webs or nests that the caterpillars group together to form after hatching from eggs laid on Devil's-bit Scabious. Ms Cremin said there could be ""20 to 50 or 100 individual caterpillars"" in a single web. ""Basically they spin this around their food plant and eat the leaves of that, and when that's exhausted, they move on to the next plant. ""So you sort of see this trail of old abandoned webs and plants as they move from one  food plant to another food plant."" Counting those abandoned nests gives a clear indication of how the species is doing. The locations are not identified publicly to give the species maximum protection, but at one site this year the team counted 53 nests up from 24 last year - an increase of 121%. Another farm recorded 139 caterpillar nests compared to just 24 last year. At another, the number more than quadrupled, from five last year to 27. Ms Cremin said the results were ""great to see"" and they proved that ""the years of fantastic efforts by our volunteers and the farmers and landowners we work with are paying off."" Like many butterfly species, the Marsh Fritillary is univoltine, meaning it produces just a single brood of offspring in its year-long life cycle. Those offspring hibernate over winter as larvae - caterpillars - in a communal silken web called a hibernaculum. Then in Spring, each forms a cocoon before emerging as an adult butterfly to lay its own eggs. Producing just one brood a year means the species is vulnerable to anything that affects the food and habitat it depends on. Between 1985 and 2019, its distribution dropped by 43%. And butterfly populations generally are struggling with 80% in decline in either abundance (how many there are) or distribution (where they are found) since the 1970s.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvdmr20jwxo

The rare-type of ice only forms on rotting wood in below zero temperatures at latitudes between 45°N and 55°N, Ms Dallow said: ""I thought it was a piece of rubbish in the ditch at first because it's really white and I got really cross, but it is rather magical."" Ms Dallow said she was walking in the Forest of Dean near Wenchford when she made the discovery. ""It was quite a big clump on a dead stick, five inches (13cm) wide and up to 10 inches (25cm) long,"" she said. ""It looked so delicate and just beautiful but you couldn't touch it because it would just collapse."" She said it was a ""pretty incredible organism"" but it ""doesn't last very long"". ""You have to catch it at the right moment, with the perfect conditions,"" she added. ""It disappears really quickly depending on the air temperature, so I do feel chuffed."" In Somerset, South West Lakes said a visitor to Wimbleball Lake made the same ""amazing discovery"". A spokesperson said the ""stunning delicate formation"", also known as frost beard, was spotted at the weekend. ""It's a fleeting phenomenon and a rare spot,"" they said. Although first reported in 1918, the exact cause of hair ice was only determined in 2015.

2025-11-27,'Extraordinary discovery' at Orkney Neolithic site,science,BBC,"Archaeologists are to resume digging at the Ness of Brodgar on Orkney after 3D radar technology led to an ""extraordinary discovery"". The dig team at the Ness, one of the most important Neolithic sites in the British Isles, are not revealing what they believe the find to be until more work is done. But they say it is like nothing else ever found at the site – and may not even be Neolithic. The Ness of Brodgar – a strip of land between two lochs - was the scene of 20 years of excavations until work officially ended in 2024. The digs uncovered 40 structures making up a cluster of buildings which showed it  was a significant settlement in prehistoric Orkney. However, a further phase of work using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was carried out this summer - producing three-dimensional images of the whole site for the first time. The scientific study produced an unexpected discovery which the team describe as ""totally dissimilar to anything else we've uncovered"". The only clue from the excavation team is that Ness is ""a site that can be seen to be defined by straight lines and rectangular forms, from the architecture down to the art"". Archaeologist Nick Card - who worked on the digs from 2004 and will return for the latest work - told the BBC's programme: ""We think this is so unusual that it could add a new chapter to the history of the Ness. ""It's at a bit of the site where there doesn't seem to be any deep archaeology, so it's not like we're getting into another 20 years of excavations. ""The archaeology that will be uncovered will be quite different. Don't expect three-dimensional Neolithic buildings. Possibly it is not Neolithic, I think probably later, but it could be contemporary."" The Ness lies just south-east of the Ring of Brodgar, the neolithic stone circle which can be seen as Orkney's version of Stonehenge. says it is ""without parallel in Atlantic Europe"". The structures already uncovered at the three hectare site were built in waves between roughly 3,500BC and 2,400BC. The latest work has again been made possible by funding from Time Team, for a new programme they will be making next year. It will, according to Nick Card, involve ""keyhole surgery"" to open a small trench to investigate ""this anomaly"". He added: ""We always said that when we put the trenches to bed, that was the end of the fieldwork. ""But last summer we conducted several types of geophysics and what that has showed up is something quite extraordinary. ""This was the first time this particular form of GPR had been used in Scotland. ""The preliminary results have just been amazing but we still have to get more analysed. ""All of this then needs to be stitched together and we'll create 3D models of the site which will give us a much better understanding of the development of the Ness."" The latest excavation will be open to the public for four weeks in July 2026. But buildings previously on show prior to 2024 will remain covered up for preservation reasons.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7836wvx4q4o
2025-11-27,Caithness power hub approved despite community concerns,science,BBC,"A controversial electricity sub station proposed for a site in Caithness has been approved by Highland councillors despite community concerns. Energy company SSEN Transmission says its Banniskirk Hub at Spittal, near Thurso, would help distributing power generated by offshore wind farms. But councillors heard at a meeting on Wednesday that local residents feared the site would overwhelm their ""small but mighty community"". Highland Council's north planning applications committee agreed with planners' recommendations to grant permission, but they added several conditions. The meeting heard from SSEN Transmission and opponents of the project. Residents said children in Spittal faced growing up on a ""construction site"". The committee said it would lose control over the planning application if it refused permission, or deferred making a decision, because it would then go to the Scottish government for consideration. Liberal Democrat councillor Angela MacLean said she had concerns over the impact of the plan on the wellbeing of local families. Following the meeting, SSEN Transmission director of development Alison Hall welcomed the committee's decision. She said: ""Today's decision marks an important milestone in delivering UK and Scottish government clean energy and energy security targets – creating a hub for projects that will help build a cleaner, more secure, and affordable electricity system for generations to come."" Banniskirk Hub would connect to the proposed 400kV overhead line between Spittal and Beauly, as well as the existing Spittal 275kV Substation. The hub forms part of Perth-headquartered SSEN Transmission's £22bn investment to transform the electricity network in the north of Scotland. SSEN said the project would deliver local benefits, including new housing and jobs, along with over £1m in community benefit funding.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ve1j8mlno

The cash from Scotland's Public Sector Heat Decarbonisation Fund will see the existing gas boiler replaced with a new system of air and water source heat pumps. The aim of the fund is to support upgrades to public buildings such as new windows, solar panels and clean heating systems in an effort to help Scotland reach its target of net-zero emissions by 2045. The library project is one of 10 schemes that will receive grants totalling £12m from the Scottish government fund. Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said the projects ""show the scale of ambition on our journey to net zero"". Ms Martin said: ""I have seen first-hand the hard work and commitment of the public sector to transform Scotland's buildings by taking action to decarbonise and improve the energy efficiency of public buildings, like the Mitchell Library."" The Mitchell opened its doors at its current site on North Street, just west of the city centre, in 1911. It houses more than a million items and serves as the heart of Glasgow's library system. Andy Taylor, from Glasgow Life, the organisation which runs the Mitchell Library, said the heating upgrade ""proves that large historic and complex buildings can be decarbonised"".

2025-11-27,New home for wildlife rescuers as demand surges,science,BBC,"A wildlife rescue centre is preparing to move to a bigger home because of ""unprecedented demand"" for its services. Cleethorpes Wildlife Rescue said it had ""grown too large"" for its centre in the town after admissions rose by a fifth over the past year. It has now agreed to lease the Floral Hall, at the People's Park in Grimsby, from North East Lincolnshire Council. A spokesperson for the council said: ""We're thrilled to see this wonderful asset being used by such an important organisation and wish them all the best going forward."" CWR rescues and rehabilitates a range of wildlife, from small birds to foxes, badgers and even But Michaela Jackson, a trustee and volunteer, said it had been forced to close its doors several times this year due a lack of space. ""If we had a fox in, we couldn't have another fox, or we couldn't have a badger or swan, because we just didn't have the premises,"" she added. The centre has eight isolation bays and four large recovery bays for animals, but hopes to triple this capacity at the Floral Hall. Ms Jackson said the new home had more space and an aviary, giving the group an opportunity to extend its range of species and rehabilitate more and larger animals, including deer. Under the plans, parts of the new venue will be open to visitors, including a tropical aviary and glass house, following restoration work. ""We're cleaning down Floral Hall, because it's not been in use for about three or four years,"" she said. The centre is temporary closed for new admissions while it prepares for the move. It is hoped it will reopen to the public in January. The volunteer-led organisation relies on public donations and is trying to raise £10,000 to pay for the renovation.

2025-11-27,Australian environment laws set for biggest overhaul in decades,science,BBC,"Australia is set to to overhaul its decades-old nature laws with a raft of major reforms including the country's first independent environment regulator. After a years-long deadlock, the Labor government struck a last-minute deal with the minority Greens party to get the laws passed, after talks with the opposition stalled. The changes include more protections for native forests, stricter rules for land clearing and a limit on fast-tracking of coal and gas projects but critics say more is needed. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the laws were a win for nature and business and would speed up major projects linked to housing, renewable energy and critical minerals. With support from the Greens, Labor's proposed changes are expected to pass through the Senate on Thursday, the last sitting day for parliament this year. For months, the opposition - a coalition of the Liberals and Nationals - had also been negotiating with the government on the bill, with a focus on gaining more concessions for businesses. Liberals leader Sussan Ley labelled the Labor-Greens deal as ""dirty"" and said it would lead to job losses in forestry. The latest development comes five years after an independent review into Australia's nature laws found they were no longer fit for purpose. The government said the reforms would protect the environment for future generations and speed up projects in ""key areas of national priority like housing, renewable energy and critical minerals"". ""Everyone agrees that the laws as they stand are broken and need to be reformed,"" Albanese said. ""Getting these laws passed is vital to protect our environment and to boost productivity in our economy."" Once passed, the new laws will also establish Australia's first-ever national environment protection agency as well as a set of national standards which would include rules on protecting endangered wildlife. It will also remove exemptions for ""high-risk land clearing"" and bring regional forest agreements under federal laws, instead of state ones. Greens leader Senator Larissa Waters said her party had negotiated significant wins but criticised the government for not including a so-called ""climate trigger"" that could stop fossil fuel projects based on carbon emissions. Instead, a project must report its carbon emissions and provide plans on how they plan to reduce those to net zero by 2050. A ""water trigger"" will be included in the laws, meaning coal and gas projects must get federal approval for their water use. Amanda McKenzie, the head of the independent climate organisation Climate Council, said while the deal would help native forests, new coal and gas projects ""still get a free pass on climate pollution"". ""That is a gaping hole in a law that should protect nature from the ravages of climate change,"" she said. On Thursday, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said Australia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - would miss its 2035 emissions reduction targets unless it made significant changes. Earlier this year, the government announced it would compared to 2005 levels over the next decade. Current projections forecast emissions will fall by just 48 to 52 per cent instead.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4nzv6v2keo
2025-11-26,Arrests at farmers' central London tractor protest,science,BBC,"Several arrests were made as farmers drove tractors into central London for a Budget day protest over plans to put inheritance tax on farm businesses worth more than £1m. More than a dozen tractors could be seen parked outside Parliament on Wednesday morning, with rush-hour traffic brought to a standstill and farmers repeatedly sounding the tractor horns while police stood watching. David Gunn, an arable farmer and agricultural contractor from near Sevenoaks in Kent, said: ""Inheritance tax is going to cripple the farmers, the small family farmers."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are backing farmers with the largest nature‑friendly budget in history with over £2.7bn a year to grow their businesses."" In Wednesday's budget the chancellor announced spouses would be able to transfer any of their £1m allowance before inheritance tax kicks in between partners. So if one partner dies and only uses part of their allowance, the surviving partner could have an allowance of more than £1m. Mr Gunn said of the plans which are due to come into force in April: ""There's all the other taxes they've been putting on us, and the prices we get for our produce and what it costs in the shop, we don't make any money. ""Then there's food security, farmers are going out of business."" He said his message to government was: ""Sort the pledge out."" ""You said in the manifesto you would look after the farmers, which you totally haven't, you've ruined the countryside,"" he said. Tyler Carter, 18, from Peterborough, was also among the campaigners gathered in Trafalgar Square. He held a sign reading: ""Dear London sorry … I'm here to fight for my future!"" When asked what the reforms would mean for him, he said: ""It means my dad will be out of a job, which means I will be out of a job. ""We have worked hard for what we've got and don't deserve to have it taken off us."" The Metropolitan Police had warned that ""anyone breaching conditions by bringing vehicles, including tractors or agricultural vehicles, to today's farmers protest will be asked by officers to leave"". A force spokesperson said on Wednesday: ""The majority have listened to officers and complied with the conditions, however, several arrests have been made."" Reform UK said it would pay for the defence of farmers arrested at the demonstration, saying it was ""outrageous"". Wednesday's protest came as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faced pressure from farmers to axe the plans to introduce inheritance tax on farming land and businesses. The chancellor's plans to introduce a 20% rate on agricultural land and businesses worth more than £1m have become a political flashpoint for a sector struggling with rising costs, tough market conditions and worsening climate impacts. Budget changes to the government's inheritance tax plans have been welcomed by the National Farmers' Union, although they say more needs to be done to reduce the impact on farmers. But the government has frozen the £1m allowance for a further year – along with other inheritance tax thresholds – until April 2031. That could drag more farms into paying the tax. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""We are also delivering on extending the Seasonal Worker Visa Scheme, protecting British produce in trade deals, investing hundreds of millions in grants and biosecurity, and driving fairer supply chains. ""Our reforms to Agricultural and Business Property Relief will safeguard public services while keeping inheritance tax fair – with three quarters of estates paying nothing, and the rest paying half the usual rate, spread over 10 years interest‑free.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8nn0l66wo
2025-11-26,Jug older than Christianity to return to Cyprus,science,BBC,"A ""significant"" jug which predates the Christian faith by hundreds of years is to be returned to Cyprus. The jug, which dates back to about 750 BC, was discovered during an auction at The Cotswold Auction Company in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and withdrawn from sale when its importance was spotted by archaeological experts. Marios Theocharous from the Cypriot government collected the ceramic jug, which is only 7cm high, earlier this month. Returning it is part of a lengthy campaign by authorities on the island to bring back items ""illegally removed"" in the 1960s and 1970s. Mr Theocharous said the jug, known as a juglet due to its small size, was ""significant"" and ""a piece of our collective memory"". It is now at the Cypriot High Commission in London, where it will remain until it is taken back to the Mediterranean island to be - it is thought - displayed at a museum. Niall Fry, saleroom manager at The Cotswold Auction House said: ""As a company, we are committed to respecting the cultural heritage of other countries, as well as our own, and fully support the Cypriot government in its efforts to repatriate antiquities. ""There is no suggestion that the seller had done anything wrong - the jug may have been in the UK for decades or centuries and they would not have been aware of its legal status in Cyprus."" The Cypriot government is in the process of recovering antiques which reflect the island's heritage. On 3 December 2024, the government said on its website it had repatriated more than 100 items from the United Kingdom, after they had been ""illegally removed from Cyprus during the 1960s and 1970s"". These included Neolithic stone stools dating back to the seventh or sixth millennium BC and pottery dating back to the Early Bronze Age, about 2,000 BC.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7krg8me7go
2025-11-27,Massive prehistoric structure found near Stonehenge,science,BBC,"The discovery of a series of huge Neolithic pits have been confirmed at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site after The massive pits at Durrington Walls in Wiltshire are set at regular intervals, ten metres in diameter and more than five metres deep. Professor Vince Gaffney said that as a ""cohesive structure"" they could be ""one of the largest prehistoric structures in Britain, if not the largest prehistoric structure"". The new research has been published in the Internet Archaeology Journal and concludes pits are almost certainly man-made and more than 4,000 years old. Prof Gaffney, from the University of Bradford, explained it would have taken a lot of effort to dig the holes - around two storeys deep - from the chalk landscape. The horseshoe-shaped pits also link to another monument near Larkhill. ""The circle is pretty accurate. It suggests that people were pacing the distances out to make sure that the pits were aligned at the same distance all the way around as the distance from the henge to the earlier enclosure"" he said. Prof Gaffney said it added to previous evidence that people were counting and applying it. ""They're inscribing something about their cosmology, their belief systems, into the earth itself in a very dramatic way."" Researchers had surveyed 12 sq km (7.4 sq m) of the landscape when they spotted the giant holes. No longer visible to the naked eye and too big to realistically excavate very quickly, they made narrow boreholes to take samples of the material from the features. DNA extracted from the samples revealed remains of animals, including sheep and cattle. The samples also helped experts date the excavations. Dr Tim Kinnaird from the University of St Andrews called it a ""super henge"" and used a method called luminescence dating: ""So just before that sediment falls into the pit, it's exposed to daylight, so we can date the time of construction."" It also revealed they were kept open for 1,000 years: ""So that spans changing cultures,"" he explained.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3vgd5732o
2025-11-28,"Buy nothing new this Black Friday, says charity",science,BBC,"A reuse charity is asking people to consider second hand this Black Friday as part of an alternative national campaign called Buy Nothing New. Kennet Furniture Refurbiz (KFR), based in Devizes, Wiltshire, collects second hand donations of furniture, homeware and appliances and is part of the national reuse network, a group of organisations which take on items to help others and sell affordably. KFR said it has passed on about 18,000 items, weighing about 340 tonnes over the last year. Daniel Thompson, managing director at KFR, said: ""We've just got to get our message out there. The reuse sector is growing, is rapidly more accepted into society."" He believes the stigma of secondhand is going: ""You've got various websites online where you can buy repurposed items, clothing, etc. I think reuse is on the up. ""Cost of living crisis is extreme at the moment so people don't necessarily have the money to spend on new items for Christmas. ""We are an alternative to that. We are an alternative to the consuming on Black Friday."" There are often Black Friday deals on appliances, but Mr Thompson explained that when they get second hand ones in to clean and refurbish, there is usually very little wrong with them, or can be quickly fixed. He explained that while recycling some items can be a good way to go, the process still produces emissions, so ""by reusing things you're generating far less carbon"". Of the 18,000 goods passed on last year by KFR, more than 7,000 were furniture and nearly 3,800 were electrical. Jen Gale, from Warminster, Wiltshire, runs a blog and podcast called Sustainable(ish) - she and her family have previously done a year of buying nothing new. She said that Black Friday can be useful if someone has a ""specific item in mind, Black Friday can be a real helping hand in terms of some financial savings"". ""I guess it becomes problematic when it's really just encouraging us to consume and to buy things that we didn't know we wanted, we don't necessarily need, and just really, encouraging that very sort of mindless and thoughtless consumption,"" she said. KFR has found itself expanding in a few ways: earlier this year it teamed up with another charity to offer house clearances. It has an arrangement with household recycling centres in Wiltshire and has opened a new location in Swindon too. It is also used by the local councils to provide furniture and appliances for those in need through the household support fund - last year this helped nearly 700 households.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2evx9l0y2o

2025-11-28,Specialist ataxia nurse helps South West patients,science,BBC,"A specialist nurse to support patients with the neurological condition ataxia has started work in the South West. It is a rare disorder that mainly affects balance and co-ordination. Charity Ataxia UK said the service would be provided over video link or phone, and although the nurse could not treat patients, they could signpost people to additional services such as physiotherapy and speech therapy that might improve quality of life. It said it hoped trialling its first service like this in England would provide a supportive link between local NHS providers and ataxia specialists based in Oxford, Sheffield and London. The pilot project covers patients in the NHS-defined South West region of England, including Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, plus parts of Hampshire, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. Ataxia is a neurological condition that affects the nervous system. There are different types of the disorder, and it can be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics, head injuries, or as a symptom of other conditions such multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease. For artist Malcolm Race, from Totnes, Devon, it means his coordination, balance and his speech are impacted. In his case, his body reacted to gluten - creating antibodies that mistakenly damaged the cerebellum - the part of the brain that controls balance. He said he first noticed something was wrong when he was working in an art college and kept falling over. When he was first diagnosed by a specialist in Sheffield, he said it was ""devastating"". He said: ""I knew there was a rocky road in front. ""I remember sitting reading the posters on the wall [of the clinic] and I remember thinking: 'What on earth is that?' It ended up being my condition."" Malcolm said he had become slower but still created his art; however, walking was exhausting. ""When I walk around I have to think before I take every single footstep. That's what makes me tired,"" he said. Ataxia UK estimates 10,000 people in the UK have the progressive form of the rare degenerative brain disease. The charity said there was not a dedicated ataxia specialist in the South West, but staff were aware of about 500 patients locally. Nurse Camilla Notley said she hoped to bridge the gap between specialist NHS centres, where patients were often diagnosed, and local neurology teams. She said: ""My role is about connecting with patients in the South West with Ataxia and all the [hospital] trusts I'm involved with, trying to create opportunity. ""A lot of these patients will have had a lifetime battle, with trying to ensure they can access the right service for whatever they need at that time. ""If I can bridge that gap and make their lives easier, then I've done the job that I'm here to do."" Camilla added: ""Unless you are asked about it, you don't realise that [a symptom] is being caused by your condition. So you don't think to ask for help, you just cope, and your quality of life could be better. ""You just need to know where to ask for help."" Andrea Nemeth, a professor of neurogenetics and hospital consultant at Oxford University Hospitals, is one of the specialists patients from the South West might see to get a diagnosis. She said: ""Medical input is relatively limited to the diagnostic phase, so seeing a neurologist and, or a geneticist; but actually the long-term management is much better addressed by allied health professionals. ""Patients and sometimes medical staff don't know that that is the case and that is where the ataxia nurse Camilla can signpost patients to all of those different services which are absolutely vital. ""Just because there aren't curative treatments, doesn't mean there aren't treatments that are really valuable for people."" Those services could be anything from occupational therapists to palliative care, to respiratory services and dietitians. Malcolm Race said he had been finding trips to appointments in Sheffield hard and was now also being treated by a local neurology team. His wife Mandy said Camilla's help had so far been ""lifesaving"" for the both of them because they had felt very alone and she had since helped them contact local services. The charity got money for the service from the National Lottery Community Fund. If successful, and more funding could be sourced, Ataxia UK it may expand the service in the country.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp1j7114yo
2025-11-26,New spacesuit 'could help astronauts' mobility',science,BBC,"The inventor of a garment featuring artificial muscles says it could allow astronauts to move more freely in space. Dr Emanuele Pulvirenti, a researcher at the University of Bristol, came up with the soft 'exosuit' which is designed to be worn under a main spacesuit. Made up of fabric muscles that work automatically to assist movement in low-gravity environments, it is hoped the suit could reduce muscle fatigue for astronauts on future Moon and Mars missions. Dr Pulvirenti said it could also eventually help people on Earth who suffer with mobility issues. Dr Pulvirenti told BBC Bristol's John Darvall that he wanted to create the new suit after astronauts reported ""being very uncomfortable"". Current spacesuits weigh about 80kgs and can ""restrict mobility"", he explained. He said the idea behind the soft exosuit is that it can be worn under a spacesuit, and the artificial muscles will help astronauts ""expend less energy"" which can be an issue during space missions. The artificial muscles in the suit consist of two layers: an outer nylon layer and an inner thermoplastic layer - a mouldable plastic - that allows the suit to be inflated. Inspired by his love for human space exploration, Dr Pulvirenti said he created the first prototype with help from a family member. ""Fortunately my grandmother worked as a tailor and she was able to give me some advice,"" he said. The suit has been tested in Australia at a simulated space mission but Dr Pulvirenti said he hopes to continue to develop the technology so it can one day be tested at the International Space Station. ""Our next goal is to create a hybrid suit that can switch between assistance and resistance modes as needed, which could be of great benefit for people in need of support with mobility going through physical rehabilitation,"" he added. Dr Pulvirenti said patients recovering from injuries, or those with mobility issues, would also be able to benefit from the suit. He said: ""They would wear it as a pair of trousers, exactly how you would day to day, except it's got the artificial muscles on top that deliver extra force to help you with mobility."" He added he hopes to one day supply these suits to those who need them in partnership with the NHS.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0x0mvrl8xo
2025-11-26,How the hologram came to be invented in Rugby,science,BBC,"With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, it is predicted holograms will become an ever-greater part of our future lives. A type of image made with a laser, holograms can make objects appear in three dimensions, rather than two-dimensional or flat. The ""radical concept"" was invented in Rugby by scientist Dennis Gabor, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his idea in 1971. Gabor was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1900 and developed an interest in physics in his early teens, before moving to the UK to escape the Nazi regime. is exploring the story of the hologram's inventor, and the continuing relevance of his innovation today. While he was growing up, Gabor's father built him a laboratory at home where he would conduct experiments. Prof Eric Yeatman from the University of Glasgow said it was an exciting time for physics. ""In those days, I think children had access to things we wouldn't really consider safe nowadays,"" he said. There were not many career prospects for physicists at the time, so Gabor was encouraged to take up engineering for his university studies in Berlin. However, when Hitler came to power, he did not feel safe in Germany due to his Jewish background, so returned to his native Hungary. Concerned about ongoing persecution, in the 1930s he moved to England. In 1933, he was invited to work at engineering company British Thomson-Houston, based in Rugby. It suited his area of interest and the firm allowed him to be inventive, Prof Yateman said. He explained it was Gabor's work on improving the resolution of the electron microscope that led him to the idea of holography in 1951, which was to become his most famous work. ""It was like a sort of bolt out of the blue, it was a completely radical concept,"" Prof Yeatman said. Edit Kruk, an experiential strategist from Hypervsn, a company at the cutting edge of the latest advancements in holography, said Gabor's legacy continued to find many applications in the modern world today. ""This actually spans so many different sectors – from automotive, healthcare, media, pop-up experiences, galleries – you name it,"" she said. ""I would say the greatest impact is attention. Nothing captures the attention like seeing something so bright, so beautiful and hovering in mid-air. ""In the automotive industry, being able to see a 1:1 model of a car and being able to customise it in real time but also to be able to see it in 3D in front of you without having to pull out the actual car."" An example of existing uses includes virtual sales assistants in department stores. Holograms could also be used to help interior design firms or architects show people how building or renovation projects could look when completed, Ms Kruk said. Gabor also predicted risks, however, including the notion that AI and holograms could potentially replace some types of employment. The scientist died in 1979 in London. An English Heritage blue plaque was later placed at his former home on Queen's Gate in Kensington, where he lived from 1949 until the early 1960s. A blue plaque can also be seen at the house he lived in on Bilton Road, in Rugby.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mpzgjjdmjo
2025-11-26,Teen builds advanced robotic hand from Lego,science,BBC,"A teenager has designed and built a fully working robotic hand out of Lego pieces. Jared Lepora, 16, from Bristol, spent about two years on the creation, assisted by his father Nathan who is a professor in robotics at the University of Bristol. ""My dad specialises in making advanced robot hands and I thought these principles were always really cool, so why not make it out of Lego?” Jared said. Nathan hopes the Lego hand, which can pick up variety of objects including fruits and cups, could one day become a ""proper Lego set for other children"" to build. The hand, which is driven by two motors using tendons, has four fingers, each functioning with three joints. Using Lego clutch gears, the mechanics of the fingers move together until they touch an object then stop moving, similar to a human hand. After building the hand and jointly writing an academic paper on it with his father, Jared was invited to give a speech at the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 conference in Hangzhou, China, and was the youngest speaker there. Nathan said he used to take his son into the lab during summer holidays, where he got familiar with 3D-printed designs while chatting with PhD students. ""And he had the idea of making one out of Lego...maybe he'll become my boss someday,"" he said. ""This genuinely could be of interest to other children to engage with advanced robotics, it's a way in for them. ""If anyone can build the hand, and maybe other children can make design changes, then that's really exciting. ""Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a proper Lego set for other children, that would be exciting,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g1001z95o
2025-11-26,Island bird counts reveal mixed picture,science,BBC,"Bird counts on an island haven for seabirds have revealed a mixed picture. The number of puffin breeding pairs on the Farne Islands in Northumberland has dropped by 23% in a year from 50,103 to 38,500 breeding pairs, the National Trust said. However, it cautioned against interpreting the drop as a sudden population decline after the island was hit by bird flu and storms in recent years which killed thousands. The annual count also revealed Arctic terns had increased by more than 26% from 410 to 519 nesting pairs and it was important the ""broader context of global trends"" was taken into account, the trust said. Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation for the trust, said although puffins were impacted by bird flu in 2022/23, they were ""not as impacted as other species"" due to their ""naturally self-isolating behaviour"". He also said the shift to annual monitoring in 2019 reflected the trust's commitment to understanding and protecting puffins long term. Implementing measures to deter seals from disturbing puffin nesting areas and encouraging them to remain within their usual pupping areas, were also helping to protect species, Mr McCarthy said. The survey also revealed other species had struggled in the last year including Common tern numbers with breeding pairs halving from 10 to 5.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9xpjekezo

Anna Longthorp, from Howden, in East Yorkshire, has joined others who drove tractors to the capital ahead of the Budget speech earlier, despite a ban on vehicles in the Whitehall area by the Metropolitan Police. She said that ""farmers categorically cannot pay this tax"", which would see inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m taxed at a rate of 20% from April 2027. A government spokesperson previously told the BBC it was ""backing British farms"" with annual investment and reliefs. Ms Longthorp said that farmers had been protesting for more than a year about the proposed tax. ""It's sheer determination because if we don't overturn it, if it's not tweaked, then there aren't going to be any farmers,"" she said. ""So we've got to fight until the end. It's having a huge burden on mental health, on our elderly and our vulnerable."" The Metropolitan Police said the decision to restrict vehicles ""was taken due to the serious disruption they may cause to the local area, including businesses, emergency services and Londoners going about their day"". Despite the ban, tractors have gathered near Trafalgar Square. Ms Longthorp said that police were ""going to struggle to arrest all of us in the big machines that we're in"". : ""We are backing farmers with the largest nature‑friendly budget in history with over £2.7bn a year to grow their businesses, put more British food on our plates, and restore nature.

2025-11-26,Meeting told some coastal homes are 'unsustainable',science,BBC,"A coastal engineer has told residents in a village facing ""unstoppable"" coastal erosion that ""some homes where they are at the moment are unsustainable"". About 200 people attended a meeting on Monday at Hemsby Village Hall, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, to hear what, if anything, could be done to protect their homes from the sea. Hemsby has lost more than 25 homes since 2013 as successive storms have eroded the sandy cliffs along a road called The Marrams. Great Yarmouth Borough Council's coastal manager, Giles Bloomfield, explained how a 25m (82ft) deep channel in the sea bed was moving closer to the shore and was causing tidal flows, lowering beach levels year-on-year and eroding cliffs. Mr Bloomfield told the meeting the erosion was unstoppable. ""The difficulty I have is I can't tell you when that next big storm is going to come, so I have to tell you [that] you have to seriously contemplate your next steps. And I can't give you any more warning than that,"" he said. Paul Lines, a fisherman who has lived in the village for 25 years, said he knew the sea off Hemsby ""like the back of my hand"". He alleged that sand pumped to Sea Palling and Bacton to protect the beaches and the gas terminals had caused a sand bar off Winterton, which in turn had impacted tidal flows off Hemsby. But Mr Bloomfield refuted the view, saying: ""The beach [in order] to be stable has to move inland and it is going to come in conflict with the homes... and we can't stop that."" He said that any coastal defences would have to be moved regularly, costing many millions of pounds, and that ""you'll still lose your home; you're delaying the inevitable"". Joanne Bowling, 37, lives on Fakes Road with her husband and three children, in a house inherited from her grandfather. She asked the meeting: ""If our house goes, where will me and my kids go? There's no way we can afford a house. Will we be made homeless?"" The council advised residents to talk to the council before their situation becomes urgent. Jason Lomasz, whose family own holiday cottages in the Newport area of Great Yarmouth, was told residents who put concrete blocks on the beach could become liable in the event of injury or death if they collapsed. The council's chief executive, Sheila Oxtoby, said the authority would not remove defences but ""if they are at risk of tipping over and killing a child, we will take action"". Peter Riches, managing agent for The Crown Estate - which owns all areas of the coastline between the high and low water marks, said: ""If anyone wants to put assets on the beach, they have to work with The Crown Estate. ""It isn't a free-for-all. [We] expect that person to take responsibility."" Another member of the public shouted: ""Shut the beach to the public and save the homes."" Mr Riches replied: ""Is the beach not your biggest asset?"" That triggered many comments including one woman, called Jackie, who said: ""We are more worried about houses that we've worked hard for, that we can't afford to lose. ""Why cant we have rocks to protect them? If we can't walk from Hemsby to Scratby, so what?"" Mr Bloomfield replied: ""If you're putting a hard point [defence] in, the erosion will happen either side. ""If you put in a hard point, you're saying ""I'm alright Jack!""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62lr24rqvvo

The site would have been situated between Worcester and Malvern, and the plans were initially submitted by German construction giant RWE. Campaigner Jo Loader-Young said: ""This is particularly ridiculous. It's in the setting of the Malvern Hills and the Malvern Hills have been an area of outstanding natural beauty because their special feature is a wonderful view."" An RWE spokesperson said: ""We are disappointed that our Chapel Hill Solar Farm has been rejected by Malvern Hills District Council and are evaluating the next steps forward for this project."" Ms Loader-Young, a member of The Preserving Powick Land and Nature (PPLAN) group, said the area had seen a ""resurgence"" in the local economy but warned tourists would not come if ""you ruin it"". She also said solar panels threatened farming, adding: ""Where are we going to get our food from if we've already plastered our farm land with solar panels?"" Other opponents to the plans raised concerns over its impact on the landscape, local wildlife, road safety, and potential fire risks linked to battery storage systems. The plans went through public consultation with Malvern District Council that concluded in March. The council met on 10 November to discuss and ultimately dismiss the plans. Ian Macleod, director of planning and infrastructure at the council, said ""the scale and siting of this scheme would cause unacceptable harm"" to the landscape. He added: ""The council respects that this was a major proposal with strong views on both sides, but our role is to determine applications on their planning merits.

2025-11-26,Highland science club celebrates 150th anniversary,science,BBC,"A charity that promotes interest in science and history in the Highlands has celebrated its 150th anniversary. The Inverness Field Club was founded in 1875 at a time when advances in science and technology, such as the coming of the railways, were transforming the region. Since then the club has run lecture and excursion programmes for people interested in topics like history, geology and meteorology. It also continues to award bursaries to help with local research projects including into Jurassic fossils in Skye. The club was set up thanks to a bequest from Inverness woman Mary Ettles who on her death left money to support lectures to be given by specialists in different fields of study. One of the early members was the architect Alexander Ross whose projects included designing Inverness Cathedral. During the 19th Century similar clubs were set up right across Scotland to celebrate scientific endeavour, but many have ceased to exist in recent years. However, Inverness Field Club is still going strong and on Saturday a civic reception was held at Inverness Town House to mark its 150 anniversary. Excursion secretary Eileen MacAskill has been a member of the Inverness Field Club for 48 years and was one of the first women to be an office bearer with the organisation. Recent trips she has organised have included going to Knockan Crag in Assynt to see where ancient continents collided leaving what is known as the Moine Thrust. ""There's not very many places we haven't been to,"" she said. ""People enjoy being out in company and there's just so much to see."" Ms MacAskill added that for anybody who was interested in history, geology and everything else about the Highlands, they always had ""exceedingly good lectures"". She said: ""It's been a pleasure to be involved with the field club and see people enjoying it. ""We've been on the go for 150 years, which is something, I think, to be proud of."" , from Inverness, has given lectures to the field club and has also benefited from grants towards her research work. She said the Highlands and Islands had a rich history of scientific enquiry and it was great to still have a club to champion this. ""The Victorian era was an exciting time because a lot of these disciplines were in their early days and there was a lot to discover,"" she said. ""The field club allowed people from every kind of background to be able to access the latest scientific knowledge. People were really hungry to hear more."" Dr Panciroli was awarded grants on two separate occasions by the field club to help with her research into Jurassic fossils in Skye, particularly of small mice like mammals. ""It was really important funding that helped us do our research."" She said it had been particularly nice to go back and give a lecture and speak to field club members. ""You are on home turf and they are a really good crowd."" Dr Panciroli added that it had been difficult for a few years to get young people involved but she was optimistic the situation would turn around. ""One of the real beauties of the field club is that you're actually meeting people in the flesh.""

Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and Stroud Maternity Hospital are joining a nationwide study that aims to spot up to 200 conditions, before symptoms appear. Doctors believe The Generation Study could be ""revolutionary"", however concerns have been raised around ethics and privacy. Director for Research, Innovation and Genomics at Gloucestershire Hospitals, Noel Peter, said: ""There are many inherited conditions, that if you identify early, the treatment can be life-changing."" The study will recruit up to 100,000 babies across England, with families given the chance to participate during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth. It is being carried out by Genomics England, a research company owned and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. Before a newborn leaves hospital, a blood sample is taken from the umbilical cord and is sent for testing. If the sample shows signs the baby may be at risk from a condition, their parents are contacted and a test can be arranged with the hope of getting an early diagnosis. Mr Peter said this allows his team to be ""more proactive than reactive"". However, GeneWatch UK - a not-for-profit research group who look at the impact of genetic science and technologies - are concerned about negative impacts on families. Director Dr Helen Wallace believes the risk of false positive results - whereby the  presence of a condition is incorrectly indicated - may cause parents ""unnecessary worry"". ""We all have genetic errors or mutations and not all of us get ill. So that means there will be a lot of unnecessary testing and parents who are worried when there baby isn't going to get sick,"" she said. A Genomics England spokesperson said they had taken ""extensive steps"" to limit false positives. ""Any newborn who has a suspected condition will receive follow-up care in the NHS to confirm whether the condition is present,"" they added. Dr Wallace also said she was worried the data gathered may be at risk of being ""open to misuse."" Genomics England said they had ""robust systems in place to protect the consented, de-identified data provided by participants."" ""Access to the data is carefully controlled, with an independent committee in place to ensure only approved individuals from approved institutions will have access,"" a spokesperson added.

Lewis Bennett, 33, made short films featuring the traditional fishing songs, using his vocals alongside fellow singers from Hastings, East Sussex. He hopes money raised from people watching the series online will support research by the Guy Harvey Foundation in Florida, which provides education on how we can use the ocean sustainably. ""It's important to give something back through the songs we use to take from the ocean,"" Mr Bennett said. Mr Bennett added: ""I'm singing the same songs as people from 300 years ago doing the most gruelling work, and I feel connected to them."" Sea shanties date back hundreds of years and were working songs for sailors. The rhythm brought a sense of fun to the hard manual tasks they would encounter on long sea voyages, pub singer Tom Kelly said. Mr Kelly, 77, has been singing sea shanties for 50 years and sings every Thursday in a local pub in the fishing town. He said: ""The songs aren't complex and you see people smiling when they listen.

2025-11-26,Recycling fire system planned over battery fears,science,BBC,"A new fire prevention system is set to be installed at a recycling centre following a rise in fires caused by lithium batteries. Operator Biffa has applied for planning permission to install the state-of-the-art equipment at its waste transfer station at Tower lane, Eastleigh. It is designed to tackle fires where traditional sprinkler and spray systems are not as effective. The move comes as lithium batteries, now found in a wide range of everyday products, continue to pose an increasing fire risk when incorrectly disposed of. The new fire suppression and prevention system will require the installation of new plant and machinery at the facility in Tower Lane. Fully automated, the system does not rely on human intervention to detect a fire. It uses infrared heat detection cameras to monitor stockpiles and identify heat spots before they become visible. If early signs of a fire were detected, the system would automatically deploy water cannons, allowing action to be taken before flames take hold. runs from Friday until 19 December. In the 12 months up to March 2025, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service recorded 156 incidents involving lithium batteries, an increase of 64 on the previous year.

2025-11-26,Grid charge changes set to make going green easier,science,BBC,"Adding green technology like electric car chargers and heat pumps to homes and businesses in Northern Ireland is to be made easier and more affordable. At present, somebody installing green technology at a home or business can be hit with an added cost if an upgrade is needed to bolster the network. Those who follow do not have to pay. It's called the first mover disadvantage, because one person pays but everyone who comes after benefits and Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald said that was ""unfair"". Changes being brought in next year mean the start-up costs will be shared across users and businesses. It's an issue that particularly affects rural communities. Home and business owners would still pay for their own connection, but the charge to secure electricity supply, known as grid reinforcement, will be spread. That charge will also be capped - according to the consultation documents, it will be a matter of £3 or so a year for households, while large energy users will pay upwards of £2000. The director of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Northern Ireland welcomed the announcement. Angela McGowan said it was a significant step forward for the local business community, which has ""traditionally faced connection charges that could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds and deter investment"". She added that the change will help to ""level the playing field"" for investors by  bringing Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and Ireland. Stuart Anderson, from the NI Chamber, said the decision would bring Northern Ireland ""into line with neighbouring regions, improving our competitiveness as a destination for business investment and decarbonisation"". since 1990. Moving to electricity is a significant part of that reduction. But Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald said the current system had sometimes proved ""prohibitive"" for businesses seeking to decarbonise or even expand. She said changing how the charge is applied would improve regional balance, as rural customers had often found themselves at a particular disadvantage. ""I think there won't be an elected representative from a rural area who will not have been lobbied on this issue. ""It impacts everyone from somebody building a house in a rural community to businesses. ""This change will mean that some people will be able to go ahead and make investments, and the sharing of the costs will make it much more fair."" The Sinn Féin minister added that it would also help with ""the uptake of renewable energy technologies"", like heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers both in homes and businesses. Concrete manufacturing is a significant industry in Northern Ireland and also a high-intensity energy user. Many companies like FP McCann are trying to reduce their carbon footprint by installing renewable technology and moving to electricity where possible. But the connection charge can run to millions of pounds, which can slow the move to greener production for some businesses or even put them off. At the plant in Knockloughrim near Magherafelt, Estates Manager Paul Hamill said the difference the change in connection charging will make is ""probably most prominent"" for companies operating in a rural setting. ""We're away from centres and the main grid infrastructure, so it takes that financial burden away from us to a large extent."" The hope is the change will stimulate interest in moving to greener, lower emission technologies, as well as making Northern Ireland more attractive to businesses. Brian Donaldson, chair of the Confederation of British Industry (NI), said it was a ""welcome boost"" for business confidence. ""If you want to invest in solar, you want to invest in heat pumps, or if you want to invest in building more plant, more capacity in your business, you're going to need more electricity,"" he said. ""So this is a good signal that now is the time to look at Northern Ireland."" He added that the move puts Northern Ireland on ""a level playing field"" with its closest neighbours. ""This is going to be very welcome news certainly for the transition to a greener, lower carbon emissions future."" The change is expected to take effect in the first half of 2026.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj837j1yxlo

2025-11-25,South West minerals have 'huge amount to offer UK',science,BBC,"Minerals from the South West could play a big part in a strategy to reduce the UK's reliance on using foreign material, the government says. Industry Minister Chris McDonald visited Cornwall to launch the Critical Minerals Strategy, which aims to produce 10% of the UK's mineral needs domestically, along with a further 20% through recycling products by 2035. Sites such as a repurposed quarry near St Austell being used by Cornish Lithium to produce lithium hydroxide monohydrate for lithium-ion batteries have been earmarked as being important to the strategy. McDonald said both Devon and Cornwall had a ""huge amount"" to offer the industry and hoped it would provide a boost to the region's economy. The government, which has set aside about £200m funding for the strategy, said China currently dominated global critical mineral production. It said the strategy aimed to prevent the UK becoming ""vulnerable from overreliance"" on exporters for its supplies. Demand for critical minerals such as lithium, copper and tungsten is set to increase over the coming years due to their use in items including mobile phones, laptops and cars. McDonald, a minister for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, said it was not a good idea to ""only buy things from one shop"" and the government wanted to increase the nation's options. ""Both Cornwall, Devon and the whole South West region have a huge amount to offer for critical minerals,"" he added. ""From the resources alone, we've got Europe's biggest lithium deposit in Cornwall and one of the world's largest tungsten deposits in Devon, along with great expertise and skills. ""It's an industry I know will add a lot of value to the local economy, but also provide really great opportunities for young people as well."" Perran Moon, Labour MP for Camborne and Redruth, said the strategy could help ""unlock the Cornish Celtic tiger"". He said: ""We do sit on a unique geology here that could drive jobs and security for decades to come."" Jamie Airnes, chief executive of Cornish Lithium, said securing a domestic supply of minerals such as lithium would help create ""high-quality jobs"".

Luke Mason, who works on a farm in Northleach, said the policy ignores the reality that many farms are asset-rich but cash-poor. The land value of even modest farms can easily exceed £1m, thereby creating tax bills of hundreds of thousands of pounds. ""We're not making enough money to pay these bills,"" he explained. ""Everyone has got it into their heads that we're all rich landowners but realistically we're barely turning a profit. ""Yes the land is worth a lot but if you're not making money you can't afford to pay these sort of taxes. It's pretty abysmal what's going on with farming in this country."" A government spokesperson said the reforms would safeguard public services while keeping inheritance tax fair - with three-quarters of estates paying nothing and the rest paying half the usual rate. By capping full relief at £1m, the government of smaller family farms while stopping wealthy investors from using farmland as a tax loophole. But Gloucestershire farmer Brian Brasington said the policy had forced generational farmers into a ""tight corner with their backs against the wall"". Families fear they may have to sell land, livestock or equipment to afford IHT, breaking up generational farms. ""It's smashing the small family farms - the very fabric of Britain,"" Mr Brasington said. ""It's not just the farmers that are fed up. I'm afraid the government have got to realise they are hurting everybody.""

2025-11-24,New food waste collection service due to cost £2m,science,BBC,"Setting up a new food waste collection service will cost almost £2m, a local authority has said. South Norfolk Council will send more than 130,000 food waste containers to homes, with the authority also needing to buy 11 new lorries. The set-up costs will be met by central government, but it is unclear what further support there might be. There will be running costs of more than £1.1m a year for the service, which is needed because – from next year – every local authority in England Framingham Earl will be among the first villages to have food waste recycling in South Norfolk The council's Conservative-run council's cabinet was told the first food waste collections will start in May 2026 in places including Scole, Long Stratton and Queen's Hills. The service will be rolled out to the rest of the district over the following months. About 67,000 homes will be sent kitchen caddies and larger containers for outside the home, along with rolls of caddy liners. However, the council has yet to finalise details for residents who have communal bins, such as people who live flats. According to a report, in other council areas where collections take place, the amount of food waste going into caddies varies between 20% and 60%. To encourage people to use their caddies, the report recommended hiring three community support officers for a year, at a total cost of £120,000. The cost for those will be shared with neighbouring Broadland Council and Steve Williams, Senior Waste Operations Manager, said they would also be used to promote ""wider recycling initiatives"" as well. But the report warned there is a ""significant risk"" when it comes to recruiting staff, partly because other local authorities will also be looking for workers. , North Norfolk District Council agreed to spend a similar amount on setting up its collection service. While the report says the initial expenditure would be covered by government funding, it is unclear what more there will be for ongoing costs – with the first year of service expected to cost about £1.15m. The government has said local authorities will get money for recycling as part of an annual funding settlement. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said its reforms were ending ""the postcode lottery of bin collections"". ""Every household in England will receive weekly food waste collections and will have the same materials collected for recycling, ending the throwaway society,"" they added.

2025-11-25,Farming family fear for the future,science,BBC,"There is no doubt this farm is a family affair. This morning's task of cleaning out a cattle shed sees owner Steven Gregory and his two daughters Emma and Lucy carry out a well-oiled drill. But as they skilfully guide 50 cattle through the yard in Hampshire, there is talk about the future. With the government set to confirm the introduction of inheritance tax for farmers from April 2026 there is a worry the next generation is about to be set on a different path. The Agricultural Property Relief has enabled small family farms - including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be handed down through the generations tax free. From April assets worth less than £1m will still be entitled to this perk but any farms over the threshold will need to pay 20% inheritance tax. The government said £2bn would be raised through the measure to fund public services. It has gone on to say it plans to back farmers with the ""largest nature‑friendly budget in history"". Steven's farm has been in his family for generations and he and his family are concerned about the future. ""My grandfather bought this in 1963,"" he said. The family farm mostly beef cattle on their 100 acres. They rent about 80 acres from their neighbour and another 300 acres throughout the Bishop's Waltham area. Steven proudly talks about his two daughters and his son who have all gone on to achieve agricultural degrees, with ambitions of working on the farm in future. He said they are ""all very keen"" and he ""couldn't be happier"". ""But we'll have to wait and see what happens, won't we?"" While his son Thomas is away working in New Zealand, the twin daughters are helping run the farm, while their mother does the paperwork. ""Since a little girl this is what I've wanted to do,"" says Lucy. ""There's young people that want to have a future in this industry but how they're going to I don't know,"" she added. ""We're a vulnerable industry as it is let alone from April 2026 - we're going to be even more vulnerable."" While the farming community argues inheritance tax is not fair, the government argues it is exactly that. It plans farms will have to pay it, just like everybody else, but at a reduced rate. Unless proposals change, farms worth more than £1m will have to pay from April. The government claims it was only expected to affect about 2,000 estates each year but even with allowances the countryside community says it will hit many more. Emma said: ""There's a lot of farms that come within this threshold of this £1m. ""So it's not just your wealthy estates which are going to be penalised."" She said if the proposals go ahead it will cost the farm hundreds of thousands of pounds. ""We'd probably have to round up about £800,000 to pay this inheritance tax,"" she calculates. ""So I worked out that £800,000 would be all of our cattle gone, half our tractors and also the equivalent of about a quarter of our land. ""I don't know where it leaves us. Because if we don't have the land, we don't have the livestock, don't have the machinery - how am I meant to make a living?"" While farmers across the region wait for Rachel Reeves to confirm what their futures hold, the government says it is continuing to support them. ""Our commitment to farmers and the vital role they play to feed our nation remains steadfast,"" according to Food Security Minister Daniel Zeichner. Following last year's Autumn Budget, the government said it would be maintaining the £2.4bn farming budget for England in 2025-26. A government spokesperson said: ""We are backing farmers with the largest nature‑friendly budget in history with over £2.7bn a year to grow their businesses, put more British food on our plates, and restore nature. ""Our reforms to agricultural and business property relief will safeguard public services while keeping inheritance tax fair – with three quarters of estates paying nothing, and the rest paying half the usual rate, spread over 10 years interest‑free.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde67gzg68go
2025-11-24,Race to rescue London's rare hairy snail,science,BBC,"Conservationists and citizen scientists have joined forces for a project to save London's ""charming little"" ice-age hairy snail. Named the German hairy snail because of tiny hairs that cover its shell and because it is believed to originally come from the continent, the rare species is one of the UK's most endangered molluscs. The fingernail-sized animal (Pseudotrichia rubiginosa) can be found only in small, fragmented patches of its historic damp riverside habitat along the River Thames. The team, led by Citizen Zoo and Zoological Society of London (ZSL), has started a series of surveys to better understand the species' distribution across the capital and inform conservation action. Taking place over the last couple of months, the team has been searching and identifying species at both known and potential river sites in boroughs such as Newham, Richmond upon Thames and Barnet. The team hopes to then build a stronger picture of the snail's current UK range, and identify how habitat restoration, pollution management and the careful movement of snails between sites can help recover their numbers. Joe Pecorelli, freshwater conservation programme manager at ZSL, said: ""This charming little snail has called our riverbanks and wetlands home for thousands of years - yet it is sadly now very rare in the UK, potentially restricted to just a few sites along the Thames."" Although first recorded in the UK in 1982, fossilised remains indicate that the German hairy snail has called the UK home since at least the Stone Age - and potentially even as far back at the last Ice Age, when Britain was still joined to mainland Europe. During this period, the Thames was still connected to the Rhine - Germany's longest river - which today empties into the North Sea. Mr Pecorelli said: ""These surveys will help us understand how the snail is faring and how we can protect it - not only securing their future for years to come, but also helping safeguard green spaces throughout London for people and wildlife for future generations."" The team hopes to then build a stronger picture of the snail's current UK range, and identify how habitat restoration, pollution management and the careful movement of snails between sites can help recover their numbers. The fine hairs that run along the slim, round shell are thought to allow the snail to sweat off moisture, helping to make its slime sticky enough for it to cling to the slippery riverside debris and the plants it feeds on. Elliot Newton, director of rewilding at Citizen Zoo, said: ""The German hairy snail is a species that helps spark imagination and open people's minds to the curious and diverse wildlife that can thrive across Greater London. ""It reminds us of the remarkable natural world that exists right on our doorstep. ""The surveys show how, by working together across the capital with many partners and empowering local communities, we can gain a deeper understanding of London's more hidden biodiversity and take steps to protect it."" The project is running in partnership with London Wildlife Trust, the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC and the Port of London Authority, and with funding support from Thames21 and the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8g4g79wgo
2025-11-24,Plants at nature reserve put on 'threatened' list,science,BBC,"A wide range of plants have been classified as threatened species according to a report by the Botanical Society of Britain & Ireland (BSBI). Some of those plants were found at nature reserves managed by Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. Of the 1,720 species evaluated for the new list, 26% were assessed as threatened. This included Betony, Marsh Marigold and Devil's-bit Scabious. Ian Carle, nature reserves manager at the trust, said ""none of these plants were deemed threatened"" in the previous 2005 report, and it was ""further evidence our native wildlife is in trouble"". The GB Red List for Vascular Plants report provides a comprehensive revision of the previous list, published 20 years ago. The term ""vascular plants"" covers all seed-bearing plants (flowering plants as well as conifers) and pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies). Red Lists are created using internationally recognised criteria to assess threat status, and are crucial in providing the evidence that underpins nature conservation, helping prioritise future action. The decline of these plants is not only a loss for wildlife but a warning sign for us all, said Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. Many play key roles in supporting pollinators, maintaining healthy soils, and regulating water, all of which people rely on for food, clean air and resilience to climate change. Over the last 50 years, grassland and heathland have seen greater decline than any other habitat. Hertfordshire has followed a similar pattern to much of the rest of the country, where more than 97% of semi-natural grassland was lost in the 50 years prior to 1984. Mr Carle said that ""on many of our grassland nature reserves, we are using traditional conservation grazing methods to reduce nutrients in the soil, thereby increasing the diversity of plant species"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yly4x3wd9o

2025-11-25,Sewage spills are the result of 'decades of neglect',science,BBC,"Sewage spills into Belfast Lough are the result of ""decades of neglect"" according to Daera minister Andrew Muir. It comes as the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) is investigating two Stormont departments and the Utility Regulator over the number of spills. Its Chief Executive Natalie Prosser told BBC News NI that Belfast Lough was in a position of ""serious degradation"" and not getting any better. Muir said the investigation was ""sadly not unexpected"" while the Department for Infrastructure has welcomed it. The OEP will examine how the Utility Regulator, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) regulate sewage discharges by NI Water. Ms Prosser said the spills are ""pernicious, damaging and the time to act is now"". Drainage in Belfast was designed by Victorian engineers as a combined system, where storm water and sewage use the same pipes. Officials have previously warned of the ""This is a complex problem with no quick fixes,"" said Ms Prosser. ""But our investigation will contribute to the work already underway in this area, so government and other decision-makers can be targeted and effective in driving much-needed improvements in water quality."" The focus of the investigation will be the regulation of how untreated wastewater, including raw sewage, is discharged into Belfast Lough and its surrounding rivers from Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW) and Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs). WWTWs treat wastewater from homes and businesses to make it safe to be returned to the environment. That includes treating raw sewage. During heavy rainfall, when sewer capacity may be exceeded, meaning there is a risk of sewage backing up into homes, streets and businesses, CSOs operate as a safety valve to prevent flooding. The Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir said it's important that the investigation is taken ""seriously"". Speaking on Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster, he said: ""Those discharges should not be occurring."" ""This is a result of decades of neglect. They are occurring because of lack in investment in waste water infrastructure."" The minister said he plans to bring a paper to the executive ""seeking to make a special designation in Belfast Lough, so that will require additional waste water treatment"". He also said he plans on bringing a separate paper ""in terms of the special dispensation that NI Water has wrongfully been given since 2007 where often it is not prosecuted due to sewage pollution, and I think that needs to be addressed"". He also called on the infrastructure minister to speak on ""her role"" in stopping the sewage being pumped into the lough. Friends of the Earth NI called the scale of pollution in water ""shameful and unforgivable"". In a statement, the group said: ""Water is our most precious resource, and it is beyond belief how so many agencies appear unfit for purpose. ""Across Northern Ireland, and especially in Belfast Lough, we have warned of repeated breaches of environmental laws that enable serial pollution to continue. ""Failure to protect water is devastating to wildlife, public health, the economy and the reputation of this country."" designed to protect water quality by not implementing them as they should have. Ms Prosser said the OEP is aware that wastewater and sewage issues exist in other rivers and lakes. ""What we find in this investigation will be relevant across Northern Ireland."" Sewage and water services in Northern Ireland are provided by NI Water. It is not in the scope of this investigation because, Ms Prosser said, it is not the OEP's role to ""step into the shoes of the regulators"" but to ensure they are fulfilling their legal duties. They ""play key roles in enforcing NI Water's own responsibilities"" in relation to sewage discharges. However, she said the watchdog would be speaking to NI Water as part of the investigation. Ms Prosser said: ""We'll be looking at whether the Utility Regulator and DfI have met their duties to take necessary enforcement action, where Northern Ireland Water may not be fulfilling their own responsibilities for sewage discharges. ""For Daera, we'll examine whether it has set and updated the conditions that allow sewage overflows to spill in line with legal standards."" Under a protection known as SORPI, NI Water is not fined in the same way that water companies in Great Britain are for sewage pollution incidents. recommended that should change. in Northern Ireland, the OEP confirmed that, along with agriculture, wastewater was one of the biggest contributors to water pollution. That pollution includes excess nutrients from fertilisers, animal waste coming from imported animal feeds and sewage. Excess nutrients are a major cause of the blue green algal crisis in Lough Neagh and elsewhere for the past three summers. If the OEP finds there has been any failure to comply with environmental law, it will work with the authorities involved but can take court action if there is no agreement.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w7qp8gnxlo
2025-11-25,"Ethiopian volcano eruption sends ash to Delhi, hitting flight operations",science,BBC,"A plume of volcanic ash from Ethiopia has swept across the Red Sea through Oman and Yemen and reached Delhi, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said. The eruption of the Hayli Gubbi volcano in Ethiopia - which was dormant for several thousand years - began on Sunday morning, sending an ash column thousands of feet into the atmosphere. Several flights have been cancelled, delayed or rerouted in India because of the ash, with the country's aviation regulator asking airlines to ""strictly avoid"" affected areas. The level of ash contamination is unclear, experts said, but it is unlikely to affect Delhi's air quality, which was ""very poor"" as per official readings on Tuesday. Volcanic ash is a cloud of tiny, abrasive particles released into the atmosphere during an eruption. It can damage aircraft engines, contaminate airfields and reduce visibility, making it hazardous to flight operations. ""The affected altitude is between 8.5km (5.2 miles) and 15km above the sea level,"" Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of IMD, told the BBC. ""It will temporarily affect satellite functions and flight operations. But it is unlikely to affect weather conditions or air quality. It reached northern India last night and seems to be headed towards China,"" Mr Mohapatra said. According Skymet Weather, a private agency, it is difficult to predict how long the ash will take to disperse, but IMD estimates that Delhi's skies should clear out by Tuesday evening. Aircraft operations have been disrupted as a result of the ash, with Air India cancelling 11 flights, while carriers such as IndiGo, Akasa Air and KLM also reportedly affected. In a statement on X, IndiGo said it was tracking the situation ""in coordination with international aviation bodies"". Mumbai Airport has asked passengers to check the status of their flights before leaving for the airport. India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued an advisory to flight operators asking pilots to immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine performance anomalies or cabin smoke or odour. The advisory also directs carriers to inspect aircraft operating near affected zones, and ""suspend or delay operations to impacted airports if conditions deteriorate"". There are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage. The level of contamination in this instance is unclear. ""Measuring contamination caused by volcanic eruptions take a lot of preparation. Sensors have to be deployed in advance. This particular volcanic eruption did not provide any room for preparation. So the level of contamination is not known,"" GP Sharma, president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather said. Professor Atalay Ayele of Addis Ababa University told the BBC that the eruption stood out because the volcano had been dormant for thousands of years. He said it had been unusually noisy but had not triggered significant seismic activity. The Hayli Gubbi volcano lies close to the Erta Ale, an area known for its active volcanic spots. Volcanic ash clouds are rare. But when Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted in 2010, it caused global travel chaos. UK and European airspace was shut or partially shut, leading to the worst air-travel disruption since World War Two.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn41vl9d5qko
2025-11-25,'Gang in balaclavas targeted our combine harvester': Farmers welcome rural crime crackdown,science,BBC,"Early this summer a gang dressed in black and wearing balaclavas approached an isolated farmhouse in County Durham as a couple in their 80s slept inside. They'd been staking out the property and knew exactly what to steal from the vehicles parked outside – a combine harvester's expensive GPS equipment that could be smuggled abroad. The farming family had fallen victim to what police say is increasingly brazen organised crime. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said on Tuesday it was launching a new three-year crackdown that would help target the 20-plus gangs said to be currently operating across the countryside. The government said the new policing strategy would be a ""vital step"" in tackling rural crime. The NPCC said this year alone more than 155 arrests linked to rural organised crime gangs had been made, with nearly £13m worth of stolen farm equipment seized, some of which had been recovered from abroad, mostly from Eastern Europe. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said that criminal gangs had been targeting farmers' machinery, livestock and land for ""too long"" and there needed to be more help from specialist rural police officers. One of the farms targeted belonged to William Maughan, a beef, poultry and arable farmer in County Durham whose parents live on the premises. He said his was one of four farms in the local parish that were broken into on the same night. Mr Maughan, a father of two, said the gang cut out GPS systems from vehicles on the farms, including from his combine harvester. His parents, both aged 80, slept through the break-in. He told the BBC: ""It was very targeted. They knew exactly which equipment to take. They knew how to get into the farm where the combine was. ""There's obviously been a lot of work done in advance to plan it and it's not a nice feeling when that happens. It feels like you're a target and could you be targeted again? ""The thought of coming across someone stealing equipment - in the early hours of the morning, fully balaclava'd-up and in dark clothing - where you live, where your children are, it's not nice."" Since the break-in Mr Maughan has had to pay out for improved security measures at the farm. ""We're in the rolling countryside, in sleepy south Durham, so to be the victim of potentially international crime like this is quite hard to believe and it is quite shocking really,"" he said. shows that the estimated cost of all rural crime decreased by 16.5% year-on-year, to £44.1m in 2024, as you can see from the graph below, although it rose sharply in Wales. These figures, however don't tell the whole story. The estimated cost of tractor thefts alone rose by 17% to £1.5m, suggesting that some criminals are taking a more targeted approach. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents rural businesses and landowners, said that farmers ""have had enough of criminals and violent organised gangs targeting them"". The scale of the police response to those gangs was revealed on Tuesday with the launch of a new nationwide rural and wildlife crime strategy that outlines how police will tackle all countryside crime over the next three years. The NPCC said it would use intelligence-led policing, data analysis and crime mapping to identify crime hotspots and target resources to where organised crime groups were operating most often. A spokeswoman for the NPCC said organised criminal gangs were ""bringing a level of sophistication and menace that demands a robust and coordinated response"". As well as machinery theft, the strategy also identifies eight other priority crime areas, including livestock worrying and theft, illegal hunting and poaching and crimes committed against protected species such as badgers, bats and birds of prey. Rachel Hallos, vice-president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), welcomed the strategy ""as recognition of the serious and organised nature of rural crime"". ""But delivery is key: farmers need visible policing, swift recovery of stolen equipment and sentencing that deters repeat offenders,"" she added. Crime and policing minister Sarah Jones said rural crime ""can wreak havoc on the livelihoods of farmers and countryside communities."". ""This strategy is a vital step in our mission to deliver safer streets everywhere and comes as we give the police new powers to take on the organised criminal gangs targeting the agricultural sector,"" she said. The minister added that rural areas would see more ""visible policing"" in the future.

They are now weighing up proposals to limit the number of trips any individual can make. BBC News website readers have been giving their opinions on whether or not that would be a good idea. Julia Cox from Castle Douglas was one of a number of people who feared the move could have consequences for the countryside. ""The number of visits shouldn't be capped, the rubbish would be fly-tipped incurring far more cost,"" she said. ""There is obviously a need for a tip for commercial waste and most commercial users would be willing to pay a reasonable price to use such a facility.""

""They could allow 12 free uses a year and over that apply a fee or charge businesses a higher rate per visit if it is a business-related dump. ""This could raise much-needed funds for other things."" Another Dumfriesshire resident, Iain Murray, said his visit numbers fluctuated. ""It all depends on the time of year,"" he said. ""With a medium-sized car and a moderately-sized garden taking non-compostable waste such as tree cuttings and hedge trimmings could involve two visits in a day. ""But averaged over a year it is probably about 26 times in a year."" Looking from outside the region, Owen McMillan from Renfrewshire suggested that a relatively high cap might be the answer. ""We need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" he warned. ""It may be reasonable to limit the maximum number of visits to an average figure of say once per week - 50 - per year. ""This would address the extreme use cases and not unnecessarily restrict people in general."" A council statement said it planned a review of its HWRCs and Zero Waste Parks. It said that although it currently had no restrictions it was clear the sites were for household waste only. It said it would benchmark against other local authorities and also establish the average number of visits it would expect an individual to make. The council added that the customer highlighted in the report visited with an estate car and trailer - sometimes three or more times a day. ""A typical household does not generate this volume of waste, which strongly suggests the material was from a commercial operation,"" it said. ""This behaviour undermines the intended purpose of HWRCs, which is to support household waste disposal.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205ww082q9o
2025-11-23,Vet changes 'show island farming vulnerabilities',science,BBC,"Vulnerabilities in the Isle of Man's farming sector have been exposed following disruption to veterinary agricultural services, a union has said. The Manx National Farmers Union (MNFU) represents 186 farms, which is about two thirds of the island's total. Key provider Milan Veterinary Practice is to stop its farm services from January next year which has prompting about a potential mass shortage of care. MNFU general secretary Sarah Comish said it was ""an enormous problem"" and the decision had exposed ""our vulnerabilities as an island"". Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture (Defa) Minister Clare Barber told Tynwald this week that the to understand its veterinary needs and how they could be met in future. Discussions were also under way with the enterprise department over potential support schemes, Tynwald was told. Parent company of Milan Vets, IVC Evidensia, originally planned to cease services by the end of November but this has now been - a decision, it said, that was based on a decline in demand. The MNFU's Ms Comish said there was ""absolutely a decline in agriculture on the Isle of Man"". There had been a ""number of shocks over the last 15 years"" and ""vital"" routes to market had ""become very, very difficult and very constrained"" for Manx farmers, she said. The last census showed that in the past 10 years the island had lost 100 farms, she said, adding that while ""some of those could have amalgamated"" the picture was ""quite stark for Manx agriculture now"". She said this reduction was ""absolutely impacting on the demand for services"" but they were still ""absolutely vital"" and needed to be in place. ""It's a much bigger picture about the viability within the economy as much as anything else, building that back up again is going to be very difficult,"" she said. ""It's going to take some collective thinking and investment from government so that we don't end up in a situation where one business is dominating the marketplace."" At Orrisdale Farm in Ballasalla, Kirree Kermode said a solution was needed ""urgently"". She said Orrisdale Farm, a fifth-generation family farm, relied ""heavily"" on vet services and had been using Milan Vets for more than 20 years. It was a ""worrying and unsettling"" time, Ms Kermode added. ""It is going to take the whole industry to pull together to figure this out,"" she said. The government's chief veterinary officer Amy Beckett said Defa was engaging with farmers and island vets to ""see how we can support as government to ensure the continuation of veterinary care"". They were considering how the department could work with, and support, private practices to provide this level of care, she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9w31l40xo
2025-11-23,Concern over worsening health of hedgehogs,science,BBC,"A hedgehog expert has said the health conditions of the animals she rescued this year have been the worst she has seen. Dru Burdon of the Jersey Hedgehog Preservation Group (JHPG) said the condition of the hedgehogs they had admitted ""is worse than it used to be"" with some dead on arrival or dying soon after. She attributed this to a lack of available food because of a hot, dry spring and summer and after pest controllers had asked islanders not to leave food out for wildlife due to a rise in the number of rats. Ms Burdon said: ""It is getting harder and harder for hedgehogs, we are ruining their habitat, warming up the planet so the ground dries up so hard that they cannot dig for food."" She said the long periods of dry weather this year had made finding food ""almost impossible"" for hedgehogs. She explained: ""The youngsters we had in this year were all weaned, but as soon as mum stopped feeding them, they were unable to find their own natural food. ""We also admitted more females than males in the summer and they were all very skinny and malnourished, like they had given all their strength to wean their babies."" In October 2023 the JHPG admitted 79 hedgehogs, 47 of which subsequently died with 26 released while during October 2024 71 were admitted, with 38 later dying and 15 being released. Last month just 27 hedgehogs were admitted, with 16 dying and 13 released. Ms Burdon said the hedgehogs that had been seen during the year had appeared to cluster around the gardens where people were feeding them. ""People do report several coming each evening, but not in the numbers they had in previous years,"" she added. She said hedgehogs could not get into fenced and walled gardens and design features such as plastic grass, paving and decking offered nowhere for them to nest and less natural food. She asked islanders to have hedgehog-friendly gardens, create openings between their gardens and put out food and water for them.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2de7xnqg3o
2025-11-23,Vietnam floods leave at least 90 dead and 12 missing,science,BBC,"At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides. The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage. The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP. The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons hit the country within weeks of each other. Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said. Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas. The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam. Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: ""Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud."" Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days. Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywl8g31g7o
2025-11-24,Campaigners warn town will die without sea barrier,science,BBC,"Campaigners have renewed calls for a tidal barrier to be installed to protect a coastal town, nearly two years after plans were shelved. Lowestoft in Suffolk was devastated in 2013 when a powerful tidal surge damaged buildings and disrupted essential services. Temporary flood barriers can be deployed if a weather warning is issued, but Penny Dack from the Use Your Voice campaign group said: ""Rather than allow towns to die, which is going to happen if a barrier is not installed, we need Lowestoft to regenerate."" East Suffolk Council said it was working with the Environment Agency and partners to ""explore the next steps in making Lowestoft better protected from flooding"". ""The tidal barrier is imperative and an important part of the resilience and sustainability of the town,"" Ms Dack said. ""We are very concerned about the lack of a tidal barrier because we don't know when the next tidal surge will be. ""It could be tomorrow or it might be in 20 years' time but that risk is always present."" The risk continues to pose problems for some of the firms badly hit during the previous flood, such as those on Commercial Road near the harbour. Some told the BBC securing insurance was almost impossible, and the overall value of their companies had taken a huge hit. One of those businesses, Alpine Fabrication, which was left 1m (3ft) under water in 2013, has recently secured a huge project with Sizewell C. But owner Carl Honeywood fears his firm might not be able to fund it as its ability to borrow money has been negatively affected. ""Cash flow is a real problem for us and, ironically, it is all down to flooding, so if there was a tidal barrier it would make financial sense to me,"" he said. ""Our insurance premium is through the roof and if there was another flood, I would need money to cover an increased excess. I'm being strangled a little bit."" Another business owner who fears what a future with no flood defence may look like is Melven Doe, managing director at Doe Metal Recycling. ""The flood was an absolute nightmare and there was about £60,000 worth of damage to machinery, and we wrote off a lorry, forklifts and other machinery,"" he said. ""For the next 12 months, that really killed the business. So if they can put a flood barrier in then that would be great."" The renewed calls for a barrier come nearly two years after the plug was pulled on the town's £199m Lowestoft Flood Protection scheme. It was designed to protect more than 1,500 homes and 800 businesses but was axed in January 2024 due to rising costs and a funding shortfall of over £124m. The first phase of the work was completed in 2023 but East Suffolk Council could not find the £20m for the next stage, and the government could not cover the costs. ""That had given me confidence to stay in business in the area, but once we found out there was going to be no barrier, we were totally deflated,"" added Mr Doe. ""We thought that would be some sort of guarantee the area was going to be safer and we were not going to still be on eggshells."" A spokesperson for East Suffolk Council said: ""We continue to engage with community groups to support raising awareness."" ""We met Use Your Voice Lowestoft at the recent annual temporary barrier deployment training exercise and discussed the issues and opportunities to engage the community to provide information around flood risk and resilience measures.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v3z9xyq1o

Warwickshire County Council (WCC) received nearly £36,500 from the Department for environment, Food and Rural Affairs through a fund operated by the Tree Council. Trees will be planted in the heart of communities, including urban streets, after they were requested by residents, the council said. Young trees will also be planted in green spaces, while existing hedgerows will be improved and new hedgerows planted to boost biodiversity. Councillor Darren Cheshire said: ""Trees and hedgerows make our towns and villages more attractive places to live, support local wildlife and provide peaceful, calming environments that are proven to support people's wellbeing."" He said the investment would help to ensure future generations could continue to enjoy ""leafy"" Warwickshire. scheme offers grants of up to £40,000 for councils and charities to grow trees on land the public can use.

2025-11-22,COP30 climate talks overrun with deadlock over fossil fuels,science,BBC,"Fights over fossil fuels and money appear to have deadlocked the COP30 climate talks, as negotiations ran through the night. Talks were meant to wrap up by 18:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Friday - and with many delegates already leaving, time is running out to secure a deal. Host Brazil had hoped countries would agree to set out how to move away from fossil fuels - but a draft deal released on Friday morning failed to mention coal, oil and gas, whose emissions are the main cause of climate change. That was unacceptable to a group of countries including the UK, while some poorer nations want stronger commitments on cash to help them cope with rising temperatures. A closing meeting - or ""plenary"" - is currently scheduled for 11:00 local time (14:00 GMT). All countries present at these annual climate talks have to agree in order to pass a deal. That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change. As a result, the conference usually overruns, sometimes by more than a day. But two-thirds of countries signed up to the UN climate convention must be present for decisions to be made, according to UN rules. And with many delegates due to leave over the coming hours, the clock is ticking for countries to come to an agreement. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would move away from coal, oil and gas. ""The world needs a clear roadmap to end its dependence on fossil fuels,"" he said ahead of the talks. It would advance a deal made two years ago, at COP28 in the United Arab Emirates, where countries agreed on the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"". The idea of a ""roadmap"" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but strongly opposed by oil-producing nations. Some of these countries argue they should be allowed to exploit their fossil fuel reserves as others have done in the past. And they have often called for the focus to be on reducing emissions, rather than fossil fuels themselves, through technology like carbon capture. Many scientists have criticised that approach for failing to tackle the problem at source. Some developing countries have not backed the fossil fuel deal, because they want richer nations to first deliver money to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. Richer nations have historically underdelivered on those promises. Poorer countries have repeatedly called for greater support, arguing they are facing the worst impacts of climate change despite bearing relatively little responsibility for rising temperatures. The latest version of the agreement, released on Friday morning, had not a single mention of fossil fuels, which was viewed as unacceptable by many nations. On Friday, UK Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband said he was determined to keep the plan for a roadmap away from fossil fuels ""alive"" in ""one way or another"". The draft deal did include a call for efforts to triple finance available to countries by 2030, to help them adapt to climate change. But it did not say if this should come from governments of richer nations or from other sources, like the private sector. Despite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil has come under scrutiny for its own plans. Its offshore oil and gas production is on course to increase until the early 2030s, according to analysis shared with the BBC by campaign group Global Witness. The forecast is based on data from respected analysts Rystad Energy, which has confirmed the figures. , arguing oil revenues can help fund the move to cleaner energy in Brazil. He has also pointed to his record in slashing rates of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

2025-11-23,Cornwall's coast becomes a whale-watching hotspot,science,BBC,"Cornwall's waters are alive with fin whales according to a Falmouth-based wildlife cruise company which says sighting continue to increase. Jake Henry Skipper, from AK Wildlife Cruises, said sightings had been increasing over the last decade, with whales arriving earlier and staying longer. ""So from July, we are over 20, really good numbers this year,"" he said. ""It never gets old, just to see something that sheer size always takes your breath away."" A stranded female fine whale calf at Pentewan but even as a newborn, its size hinted at the scale of the adults, which can grow up to 88ft (27m) long. Prof Peter Evans, director of the Seawatch Foundation - which monitors sightings, said the whales' growing presence was closely tied to food availability. ""The main period that they've been seen is winter, from November through to March,"" he said. That timing matches the seasonal boom in herring numbers, a favourite prey. ""There have been close associations with large shoals of herring,"" Prof Evans said. The spread is not limited to south-west England, he said. ""We've been seeing an increased number of sightings up in the Hebrides, in Shetland, and also on the east coast of Scotland, from the Firth of Forth up to Cape Wrath,"" he said. Even the North Sea sees occasional visitors, with reports off east Yorkshire near Whitby. ""They do cover the whole sort of UK,"" he said, though they are far more common off the west coast, where the continental shelf edge offers rich feeding grounds. Climate change may also be nudging the trend, he said, though he stressed the main driver was prey availability. For him, the rise in sightings was a sign of hope. ""It's very pleasing to see,"" he said. ""It shows how the species has recovered from overexploitation."" Cam Molland, first mate at AK Wildlife Cruises, said: ""It's a common misconception that if you want to see stunning whales and dolphins, you have to go all over the place, but the amount of cetacean biodiversity that we have in Falmouth Bay is without a doubt world-class.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5eg5349y4o
2025-11-24,Scientists look at new solutions to aphid problem,science,BBC,"Using other insects to control pests like greenfly has been a massive success story for farming, reducing the use of chemical pesticides. But new research from Harper Adams University suggests the aphids may well be evolving resistance to this approach. Scientists there are talking to the companies that farm wasps and produce other biological controls to alert them to the issue. The solution might be to diversify the genetic mix of wasps and other predators, so they can out-evolve any resistance the aphids come up with. On one Shropshire fruit farm, just down the road in Newport, there are still a surprising number of strawberries for early November. The farmer there, Gabriel Slabbert, has used tiny wasps, no bigger than a grain of rice, to control a grower's eternal enemy, aphids. This is biological pest control and Mr Slabbert said it was an ""essential"" tool for farmers. He said many pesticides were restricted or even banned and supermarket buyers also wanted growers to reduce their chemical use. ""We hang a tube [containing wasps] at the side of the gutter. Open a little trapdoor and they fly out to do what they need to do,"" he said. But the wasps do not eat the aphids, like ladybirds do, rather they inject an egg inside the aphid. As it grows into a baby wasp it also kills the aphid and means the strawberries of Littywood Farm continue to thrive. However, researchers at Harper Adams University have found that aphids are starting to become resistant to the commercially grown wasps. ""It's patchy, and sometimes they work fine,"" Laura Martinez-Chavez, from the university, said. ""But sometimes they don't work at all or at least aren't as effective as the grower expects them to be."" It is not unusual for pests to develop resistance to chemicals over time, but in this case some aphid populations have found a way of countering their predators by stopping their eggs developing inside them. It means these particular wasps no longer kill the aphids and so are less effective or even useless as a form of pest control. ""It happens in nature"" Entomologist Professor Tom Pope explained. ""First one side evolves resistance, but then the other evolves to overcome it."" There is a lot of complex genetics going on here, which the researchers are studying, while also warning the companies which produce the wasps of the danger. The likely solution is to diversify the genetic mix of wasps and other predators. Currently the extent of this resistance is unclear, but by taking action now it is hoped the industry can preserve the effectiveness of biological control in the long term.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddr88j3d14o

2025-11-21,Scientists reveal what triggered Santorini 'earthquake swarm',science,BBC,"The ""swarm"" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered. They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them. One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions. The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt. Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956. The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm. The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor. The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These ""magma intrusions"", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: ""The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something. ""[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally."" For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over. ""The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,"" explained Dr Hicks. ""We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust."" Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that. And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe. ""Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,"" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, ""that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p783g2j5o
2025-11-21,Potential emissions revealed for controversial Jackdaw gas field,science,BBC,"Planet-warming greenhouse gases from the lifetime of the controversial Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea would be the equivalent of 90% of Scotland's emissions for 2023. The oil giant Shell has published details of the environmental cost of burning fuel from the field over 11 years, should it be given approval. An assessment of the plans, along with those for the Rosebank oil field off Shetland, had to be resubmitted after they were successfully challenged in court. The company says the estimate is at the highest end of what's likely and still less than if the gas was imported from overseas. Total highest scenario emissions for 'Scope 3', which covers the end use of the fossil fuels produced, is equivalent to 35.8 million tonnes of carbon compared with Scotland's total emissions for 2023 of 39.6 million. However Shell says the most likely levels of production would generate 23.6 million tonnes. Most of that is expected to be emitted between 2028 and 2032 when production would be at its peak. Shell says that equates to just 1.3% of the UK's fifth carbon budget - which runs between those years. A carbon budget counts the total amount of greenhouse gases which can be emitted over a five year period, which allows for annual fluctuations caused primarily by the weather. If approved, the gas will come ashore at the St Fergus gas terminal in Aberdeenshire where it will be processed before entering the gas transmission network. In theory it could be used anywhere in the UK, though with another three gas  terminals in England the majority is most likely to be used in Scotland. The emissions from Jackdaw are a fraction of those estimated for the Rosebank oil field, which is expected to emit almost 250 million tonnes over its lifetime. Both projects are well through the construction phase but a judge ordered that production was not to commence until fresh environmental impact assessments had been considered by the UK government and regulators. Those documents are now on the minister's desk awaiting a final decision over whether they can go ahead. Consideration has to be given to the impact of the two fields on a legally-binding commitment to keep global temperature rises to below 2C. Publication of the assessment from Shell comes as the latest UN climate change negotiations - COP30 - draw to a close in Brazil. A spokesperson for Shell said the UK will need gas ""for many years to come"" and that the Jackdaw field will provide enough fuel to heat 1.4 million homes. They added: ""Producing gas here in the UK generates less emissions than shipping it from overseas, while strengthening energy security, supporting local jobs and contributing to the UK economy. ""To be clear, the UK will consume this gas, wherever it is produced. Homegrown energy projects like Jackdaw can help to reduce overall emissions."" Commenting on the report, Greenpeace UK's co-executive director Areeba Hamid said: ""Now our legal win has forced Shell to reveal the sheer scale of pollution expected from Jackdaw, it's looking more and more like a dud project for the UK. ""The gas from Jackdaw won't take a penny off our energy bills but will generate as many emissions as 20 million cars driving on UK roads for a year. This will fuel more extreme weather like the devastating droughts, wildfires and floods we have seen this year, leaving ordinary people to pick up the bill. ""It's decision-time for ministers. If they approve Jackdaw, it'll be Shell's profit, our loss.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d09xp1ye2o

The company said the water treatment works were already exceeding their permitted flow limits and that allowing an increase would create an ""unacceptable risk of pollution"" to local watercourses. Ms Wilson said: ""If planning consent is granted without our recommended condition, the developer could connect regardless of these constraints [to the system]. ""Our proposed condition simply ensures that connections are delayed until our Bedford growth scheme is delivered. ""We are addressing capacity issues, we are not seeking to block development."" Anglian Water said that it had got a legal opinion confirming that such a condition would be lawful, according to the But the committee heard that the council had received its own legal advice, which did not support imposing the condition. Planning officer Gavin Chinniah said planning conditions must be lawful, be proportionate and meet national policy tests, and that Anglian Water had not provided the site-specific modelling needed to justify it. ""There's been a lack of engagement from Anglian Water with the planning department. We've only had one meeting in two years,"" he said. Committee chair Jonathan Abbott criticised Anglian Water's environmental performance and long-term investment decisions. ""It does frustrate me that we have a consultee who, [which] has been pointed out by a few people, pays out hundreds of millions of pounds a year in dividends, giving bonuses to people who pollute our rivers. ""I appreciate you don't want to do further damage. [But] you should be, in my view, investing properly and you should have been investing properly for a long time.""

2025-11-22,Community freecycle event expands to third site,science,BBC,"A recycle and reuse event that aims to reduce costs to families and save items from being thrown away, has expanded to another town. The Forest Exchange project in Coleford, Gloucestershire, allows people to donate items they no longer need so others can make use of them. The items on offer at the ""face-to-face freecycle"" event include things such as books, clothes and household items. Volunteer Louise Penny said the project, which started as a community scheme in nearby Lydney, has been going from ""strength to strength"" over the last three years. ""We wanted to widen it further into the Forest [of Dean] which is great because it show's how much of a success it's been. It's going from strength to strength,"" she said. Previously known as The Lydney Exchange, the scheme has branched out across the district to now cover Cinderford and Coleford, where it will be known as the Forest Exchange. ""People can just come along to our events and get whatever they want really,"" said Ms Penny. ""We do have wide range of things, books, clothes, household items that people might want and we're actually running out of men's clothes at the moment. ""We have masses of women's clothes."" Ms Penny said it is an event where everyone can ""take what they need and give what they can"". The Forest Exchange event in Coleford is supported by local Pastor Sam Davis and will be opened by Mayor Nick Penny. The event will be held at Coleford Baptist Church on Saturday and will run from 13:00 to 15:00 GMT.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crexe0v5jlro
2025-11-21,Owner wants law change after dead cat found at tip,science,BBC,"A pet owner is calling for a change in the law after her cat was found dead inside a bin at a local tip. Sue Mead, 63, said she was heartbroken after receiving a message to say that the body of three-year-old Murphy had been dumped at a recycling centre in Newark, Nottinghamshire, on 13 November. While the cause of how Murphy died remains unknown, animal charity Beauty's Legacy, which has been helping Sue since the incident, suspects her pet may have been hit by a car. Ms Mead is now urging for tougher laws to be introduced requiring people who have struck a cat with their car to report it. Ms Mead said the way her cat had been dumped before being identified through his microchip was ""callous"". ""We noticed he was missing in the morning, and I was looking and calling out for him before I got the message,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe anyone could do that... to just discard a cat in a bag and shove him in a tip. ""He was still wearing a collar. He was clearly somebody's pet - and a huge part of our family."" She believes the law needs to be changed to help families get closure if their pet goes missing in this situation. ""People must report it if they hit a cat with their car - that cat could be saved and taken to the vets,"" she said. ""I'd hate to think that another family has to sit at home, agonising like we are."" Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, drivers must report an accident if they hit a horse, cattle, ass, mule, sheep, pig, goat or dog - but cats are not included in the law. Beauty's Legacy has been campaigning for this to change for the past decade, with the charity's owner Lisa Dean branding the law ""outdated"". ""Most people are shocked when they hear that it isn't a legal requirement for people to report when a cat is killed in a road traffic accident,"" she said. ""Thousands of cats go missing every year, and a large number of these have been hit by a vehicle and left somewhere. ""It is not fair that other animals are included and cats aren't. It needs to change."" Ms Mead added even if Murphy was not hit by a vehicle, it was the principle of reporting the incident that mattered. She said: ""You should always report it if something like that happens - families deserve answers and to know what's happened to their cat. ""We're heartbroken that Murphy was put in a bin. He deserved better than that.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0dky9p79o
2025-11-22,Photographers rally to highlight wildlife loss,science,BBC,"Some of the UK's top wildlife photographers have come together to highlight the dwindling of habitats needed to support wildlife. A book containing dozens of images has been produced as a ""manifesto to what is at stake,"" said Irene Amiet, who heads the Wilder Britain project. ""We can only feel nature's losses if we know what we stand to lose,"" she added. Photographers ""continuously observe the changes in our local landscapes and how wildlife numbers keep diminishing,"" she said. The photographer, who lives in the Ribble Valley in Lancashire, said she had been focusing on her local owl population, which had ""decreased rapidly"" following last year's cold winter. ""You can't take anything for granted,"" she added, ""one minute you think you have a healthy population but then everything can change"". More than 60 photographers had donated images for the book, with all profits going to the Rewilding Britain organisation, she explained. Across the country habitats are rapidly disappearing due to ""expanding towns and construction,"" said Worcestershire photographer Sarah Drury. ""Each lost piece takes with it irreplaceable biodiversity and a little of our shared natural world,"" she added. ""Yet through local conservation efforts and community awareness, there remains hope to restore habitats before they're gone forever."" Staffordshire-based Andrew Mason said he had witnessed a ""worrying"" decrease in wildlife in his local area. ""We're losing our butterflies, we're losing our bees, our insects,"" he explained. ""We've seen a reduction in the birds because the farmers are cutting the hedgerows, taking away their food source for the winter. ""It's really quite upsetting,"" he added. There are some positive conservation efforts going on, he added, ""but we really have to work at this if we stand a chance of saving what we've got left."" Shropshire photographer Andrew Fusek Peters said it took several years of searching to find and photograph black darter dragonflies Their favourite spots to roost include the reed beds on the Long Mynd, in the county. ""Sadly, climate change and the drying up of the shallow bog pools they favour for breeding has seen a precipitous decline of this iconic species,"" he said. ""Dawn is a magical time and if you are lucky, you might find a male and a female drenched in dew, glittering like Faberge broaches in the early sunshine,"" he added.

2025-11-21,At least five killed in Bangladesh earthquake,science,BBC,"At least five people have been killed, including one child, and more than 450 injured after a 5.5 magnitude earthquake hit Bangladesh. The epicentre of the earthquake was close to the Narsingdi district, about 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) from the capital, Dhaka. People rushed from residential buildings as buildings shook and makeshift structures collapsed. At least 10 students were injured in a stampede as they tried to leave Dhaka University on Friday. ""We have never experienced an earthquake this powerful in the last five years,"" said the country's environmental adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan. At least three people were killed when a railing and debris fell from a five-storey building in Dhaka's Armanitola area, deputy police commissioner Mallik Ahsan Uddin Sami said. Nitai Chandra De Sarkar, director of the department's monitoring division, said 461 people have been reported injured across the country, including 252 in the Gazipur district, north of Dhaka. Sarker told the BBC: ""Our main task at the moment is to assess casualties and damage. We are not yet seeing the challenge of rescue from the rubble or debris management at that level."" Bengali Sadman Sakib told Reuters news agency: ""I have never felt such tremor in my 30 years of life. We were at the office when the furniture started shaking. ""We rushed down the stairs on the street and saw other people on the road already."" A student called Abdullah, who was sleeping at the time of the earthquake, told Reuters the ""whole building was shaking"". Tremors were felt in eastern Indian states bordering Bangladesh, but there were no reports of major damage. The earthquake caused Ireland's second cricket test match in Bangladesh to stop temporarily. Coaches and players not involved gathered at the boundary, while those in the stands took shelter.

2025-11-21,Narwhal carcass washes ashore on County Donegal beach,science,BBC,"The body of a narwhal, a species of toothed whale normally found in Arctic waters, has washed up off the coast of the Republic of Ireland. The female narwhal was discovered by a family walking on Sweet Nellies Beach on County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula last weekend. It is understood to be the first recorded sighting of the species in Irish waters and only the tenth recorded stranding of the species in western Europe. ""This is an extraordinary and unprecedented event,"" Niall Ó Donnchú of Ireland's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said. Male narwhals grow a long, spiralled tusk, giving rise to the species being sometimes referred to as the unicorns of the sea. Generally, this trait is seen in males, although, there are a few females who have tusks. Narwhals live above the Arctic Circle, right up to the polar ice cap. In the summer they migrate to coastal waters and the fjords of Greenland and Canada moving offshore again in winter to avoid being trapped by ice. There are an estimated 170,000 narwhals living worldwide and their natural predators are polar bears, orcas and sharks. The female narwhal that washed ashore in County Donegal was taken to the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Cork for a post-mortem examination and tests. ""As we await the results, NPWS will continue to work closely with our partners to monitor Ireland's marine environment and to better understand the impacts of climate and ecological change on vulnerable species,"" Mr Ó Donnchú said. The whale's stranding in Donegal was initially reported to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG), whose volunteers, along with NPWS staff, were able to retrieve the narwhal. ""It's a remarkable stranding,"" Dr Simon Berrow of the IWDG said. ""As our waters warm, we have seen a northward movement of whales and dolphins in Irish waters as fish move north seeking cooler conditions. ""To have an Arctic species stranded for the first time is somewhat unexpected."" He said the incident ""highlights the benefit of long-term monitoring schemes"" and said the public play a vital role in helping to alert organisations like themselves to these sightings. Dr Berrow told BBC News NI the post-mortem was carried out on Monday, but it is still too early to tell the exact cause of death for the young female animal. Ireland's Minister for Nature, Heritage and Biodiversity, Christopher O'Sullivan, said the examination of the whale will hopefully ""reveal important details about its life and history, and shed some light on the reasons why it arrived on our shores."" ""The narwhal is an Arctic species that is mainly found in cooler waters. ""Findings like this are a stark reminder of the vulnerability of wildlife in the face of a changing climate, and the need to protect them,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz94wnk15v9o
2025-11-21,Bird flu detected in swans at five locations across NI,science,BBC,"Bird flu has been detected in swans at five locations in Northern Ireland. The discoveries in Belfast, Newtownards, Armagh, Newry and Dungannon follow four confirmed cases in kept birds across Northern Ireland. for flock keepers was announced following reports of suspected cases of bird flu. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) said that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) had been detected in the swans. Daera collects dead wild birds for surveillance purposes to help understand if, and when the virus is present in Northern Ireland and how it is distributed geographically. Daera explained that once HPAI has been detected in a specific area, further testing is not required and therefore, not all birds will be collected. ""Reports will be assessed and a decision made on whether to collect and sample the carcase,"" they said. The department advised that if you find dead wild birds, then you can report them to Daera via their The Public Health Agency (PHA), advises that human infections with HPAI are rare and the risk to the health of the public is very low. The current PHA guidelines are: The Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Bird flu is a disease caused by a virus that infects birds and sometimes other animals, such as foxes, seals and otters. The major strain - circulating among wild birds worldwide - is a type of the virus known as H5N1. It emerged in China in the late 1990s. Bird migration has led to outbreaks in domestic and wild birds. The virus has in very rare cases infected humans. Scientists say the current risk to humans is low. Transmission from birds to humans is rare and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission. There is no way to predict whether avian flu will trigger a pandemic in humans, but experts are monitoring its spread and studying how it is changing and evolving.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewjlxn1dgjo
2025-11-21,Archaeologists discover 'ancient monument' on farm,science,BBC,"Amateur archaeologists have found evidence of what they believe was a ""significant"" Bronze Age monument from about 4,500 years ago on a farm in Greater Manchester. Wigan Archaeological Society said they had discovered what is thought to have been an ancient burial site on the land in Aspull - with the history of the site potentially stretching back even further. Member Bill Aldridge said: ""We think it's been repurposed from an earlier monument – a neolithic henge – because the size of the ring ditch around it is so big and it's oval in shape, with an entrance at one side. ""Bronze Age people didn't do that."" The society have been excavating the site with the farmer's permission since 2022.

Students played the roles of different countries, gave speeches, and ""negotiated"" with one another to strike international deals at the ""Mock COP"" conference held on Wednesday. Mohammed Siddiqui, a PhD student in engineering and chair of the student union's sustainability council, said it allowed participants to step into the shoes of world leaders. ""As our generation is going to inherit the next era of decision-making, governance... we want to ensure we have a planet we can sustain but future generations can sustain as well,"" he said. Human geography student Andrew Alvedro, who chose to represent Spain, said there is an ""air of anxiety"" among young people, but also ""a sense of disillusionment."" ""When I said to some of my friends I was going to an event like this, they said 'what's COP?' - that's a bit concerning,"" he said. ""I think that kind of shows some of us are just sticking our heads in the ground."" He added he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about progress in tackling climate change. ""We know the science, we have the technology to deal with this crisis and yet instead of dealing with it, we're going in loops and circles,"" he said. ""We need to sort out the politics because the science has already worked itself out."" This year marks a decade since the landmark climate agreement was struck at COP21 in Paris, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C.

2025-11-22,GPS tags for Dartmoor ponies grazing wild areas,science,BBC,"Dartmoor ponies roaming the hills of west Cornwall are getting a tech upgrade. The National Trust has started fitting GPS [global positioning system] collars to some of its ponies to make sure they can be tracked across the 1,482 acres (600 hectares) of land they help manage. Ash Pearson, countryside manager for the National Trust in west Cornwall, said the move was vital for conservation. ""We've got over 30 ponies, but we only tag the lead animals in each herd. If we know where they are, we know where most of the ponies are,"" he said. The collars, which sit around the ponies' necks, send location data to a phone or computer. They were designed to release easily so the animals did not get caught on rocks or scrub, the trust said, although it sometimes meant staff ended up tracking a collar instead of a pony. Mr Pearson said the ponies were key to keeping Cornwall's landscape open and full of life. ""If we didn't have grazing animals, the land would close in with bramble and scrub,"" he said. ""We want a mix of habitats, grassland with wildflowers alongside bracken and scrub and ponies help create that."" Most of the trust's land is grazed, split roughly half and half between ponies and cattle. The trust said it was using about six trackers because they were expensive, but that was enough to monitor the herds. The ponies graze in rotation, moving from site to site once they have done their job. ""They trample bracken, nibble new shoots, and keep grasses short so wildflowers can bloom. That supports pollinators and the whole food chain,"" Mr Pearson added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw9ejey0qvo
2025-11-21,RSPCA warns of increase in abandoned pets,science,BBC,"An animal charity has warned of an increase of animal abandonment in the lead-up to winter. The RSPCA said animal abandonment cases in Devon had gone up by 14.9% so far this year, with 362 incidents logged by the end of October, compared with 315 last year. In Cornwall animal abandonment cases went up by 40.4%, with 205 incidents, compared with 146 last year, according to the charity's figures. It said in one particularly bad case a dog named Nova in Devon was confined to a cage and left to starve, while in Cornwall a dog named Layla was rescued from ""a filthy, faeces-filled and rubbish garage"". In Nova's case, the RSPCA said the dog suffered with severe malnutrition and cachexia, a metabolic syndrome that causes significant loss of muscle and fat tissue. A concerned resident got in touch with the RSPCA and it was discovered her former owner had moved address and left her behind, said the charity. Nova, now about two years old, had since made a good recovery and had regained weight and muscle tone. It said Layla, the dog rescued from Cornwall, had since been rehomed. RSPCA superintendent Simon Osborne said colder temperatures and dark nights would make it harder for animals over coming months. ""Every year, we find loving new homes for tens of thousands of pets, and rescue countless animals from situations of hopeless cruelty and neglect,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr1jn14rjjo
2025-11-21,The 'toughest crop': Can tech help cardamom farmers?,science,BBC,"""People often think cardamom is a lucrative crop - it may be. But it's also the toughest crop a farmer can cultivate,"" says Stanley Pothan, who has been farming cardamom in the southern Indian state of Kerala for decades. Prized for centuries for its complex, aromatic flavour, cardamom is fiendishly difficult to grow. ""Cardamom is a very delicate plant - prone to diseases and pest attacks. You have to be constantly in the field, watching every leaf, every flower. It demands attention every single day,"" says Mr Pothan. It's also extremely sensitive to weather conditions. ""Last year's summer was brutal - we lost a significant portion of our crop to the heat. Guatemala, the world's largest cardamom producer, lost almost 60% of its crop that season, and we too suffered badly here in Kerala,"" he adds. That poor harvest contributed to a 70% jump in cardamom prices last year to 1,178 rupees (£10; $13) per kilo, up 70% compared to the previous year, according to figures from India's Spice Board. Cardamom has always been expensive, usually the third costliest spice by weight, after saffron and vanilla. Farmers would be keen to raise their output, but it's not easy. ""One bad summer or unexpected rain can wipe away the entire effort. That's the harsh reality of cardamom farming,"" says Mr Pothan. The government-funded Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI) is trying to ease the burden of tending to cardamom's needs. ""Our focus is on crop improvement, pest and disease surveillance, soil management, capacity building, and technology transfer related to cardamom,"" says Dr A B Reema, Director of the ICRI, which is part of the government's Spices Board of India. One of its tools is an app that farmers can use to monitor the health of their soil and gives them tailored recommendations on how to best manage it. ""Technology is no longer separate from farming. It is now a daily tool for cardamom growers, from checking soil health on an app, to monitoring rainfall and disease alerts on their phones,"" says Dr Reema. ""Even small farmers today are using digital tools. They don't have to depend only on local advice, they can check the soil quality, moisture, and even disease symptoms right from their field."" Meanwhile, scientists are looking for hardier cardamom varieties. ""We are mainly focusing on developing cardamom varieties that are tolerant to major diseases and pests, while also being high yielding and climate resilient,"" says Preity Chetty, assistant professor at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Kerala Agricultural University. They have made one breakthrough, by finding a cardamom variety that can grow with limited water. The researchers are also delving into the genetic make-up for cardamom to find genetic markers for desirable traits. That knowledge should speed up the breeding of more productive plants. ""Unlike other spices, studies on cardamom are limited, especially at the molecular level. There's a lack of molecular markers for reproductive or yield traits, which we are now trying to address,"" says Dr Chetty. One key process in cardamom farming is drying the pods once they have been harvested. Traditionally only the larger farms could afford to set up their own dryers, often fueled by wood. ""Smaller farmers had to depend on middlemen or neighbours for drying, which often affected the quality,"" says Annu Sunny, who founded the social enterprise, Graamya, in 2016 to help farmers in Kerala. ""As cardamom is the queen of spices and a cash crop lot of people have started get in to cultivation,"" she says. ""It's a very tricky crop. It takes 10 to 12 years to really understand cardamom, how it behaves, what it needs, when to act and when to wait. Every season is like a new experiment,"" she adds. To help farmers with the drying process, Graayma has introduced heat-pump dryers. Graayma charges 10 rupees per kilo, which is significantly cheaper than wood drying which cost around 14 rupees per kilo. ""The finish of the product is much better, there's no smoke, no uneven heating, and the pods retain their natural green colour. That's very important because colour decides the price."" Growing cardamom with the help of fertilisers and pesticides is hard enough, but some farmers are going a step further, by taking an organic approach to cultivation. ""When I first started, I had no idea what I was getting into,"" says Mathews Geroge, formerly a banker who turned to farming in Kerala in 2020. ""When I first spoke to scientists at the Cardamom Research Institute, they discouraged me. They said cardamom is too sensitive and difficult to grow organically."" Initially they appeared to be right - around 90% of his first crop was destroyed by pests and local traders rejected his cardamom because, to them, it looked in poor condition. After two years of experimentation he turned to the ancient Indian cultivation methods of Vrikshayurveda, which he says has bought more success. But it's still not easy. ""Even today, I wouldn't say I've mastered cardamom farming. It's still a challenge. Some seasons are good, some aren't. But now I understand the rhythm of the crop - when to act, when to wait, when to let nature do its job."" Ultimately, Mr Geroge thinks organic farming will be able to compete with traditional methods. ""Sustainable farming begins with reducing input costs. Many farmers think organic means expensive, but if you make your own inputs and understand your soil, you can actually earn better with less dependence on chemicals."" One aspect of cardamom farming that is unlikely to change soon is the need for skilled workers. Mr Pothan estimates that labour accounts for 75% of his costs and most of that is spent at harvest time. ""Harvesting is a skilled job - mostly done by women. They know exactly which capsule is ready and which isn't. They may pluck one or two from a bunch and return to the same plant after 45 days for the next round. That's why it's so labour-intensive,"" Mr Pothan says. Ms Sunny says those jobs are likely to be secure. ""Mechanisation in cardamom is limited. You can mechanise spraying or de-weeding, but not pruning or harvesting. Every innovator who visits our farm looks at cardamom and says 'we'll solve this'. But nothing concrete has come out yet."" Mr Pothan agrees and adds that cardamom demands more than just good process. ""In cardamom, there's no shortcut. You can't automate everything. It's one of those crops that needs both science and soul.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0g2xxnrj3o
2025-11-20,Town's sugar beet factory marks centenary,science,BBC,"A factory that produces about 320,000 tonnes of sugar every year is marking its centenary. However, working life at the British Sugar factory in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, has undergone a significant transformation in the last 100 years, and the facility also generates electricity and sells animal feed, according to site general manager Andy Simms. ""There's a lot less people and it's a lot more automated - both at the factory and the inbound supply chain from the growers,"" he said. The company is the only processor of the UK's beet sugar crop, and it works with about 2,300 growers in the East of England, the East Midlands and Yorkshire. When the factory opened in 1925, most of the crop arrived by rail and its workers lived on site. Today, the factory receives between 600 and 700 lorry loads of sugar beet a day, according to Dan Green, British Sugar agriculture director. ""This pad behind us can hold up to 40,000 tonnes of sugar beet, and the factory behind us is processing up to 15,000 tonnes a day,"" he said. Mr Simms explained that the factory also dealt with more than sugar, and it opened its anaerobic digestion plant in 2016, converting energy into electricity, with the excess exported to the National Grid. ""The mud and stones that come in stuck to the sugar beet, we'll turn those into top soil and aggregate for onward sale; once we've pulled the sugar out of the beet, we take the residual pulp and we'll either make energy out of it in our anaerobic digestion plant or we'll dry it for animal feed - we're the UK's biggest supplier of animal feed,"" he said. Malcolm Stevens said he had seen a lot of changes since he began working for British Sugar 47 years ago, aged almost 19, and he enjoyed the variety his job offered. ""I've worked my way through all sorts, from driving to running process, to doing the controlling on the pack out here in the winter when it's freezing cold, or out here in the summer doing maintenance,"" he said. Mr Stevens, whose son Harry also works for British Sugar, is hoping to retire in February. ""I've met some super people, management and workforce - I will miss the place,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvevd6lry3o
2025-11-20,'Shivering' rare bird rescued on cruise ship,science,BBC,"A rare bird endangered across the UK has been rescued after taking shelter from heavy rain on a cruise ship. The corncrake, an RSPB red-listed bird, was spotted on the 16th deck of Sky Princess by passenger Charlene Halsey and her daughters ""shivering"" under the step of a hot tub as it travelled to Portland, Dorset. After regularly checking on the stowaway and noticing it was cold, the family kept it in their cabin overnight before handing it over to a wildlife conservationist when the ship docked. The bird, slightly bigger than a blackbird, favours dry land and is thought to have landed on board when the ship was cruising in the Mediterranean. Ms Halsey said: ""It was raining quite hard and the poor thing was shivering. ""We monitored it for a while and it was wandering around, seemingly unable to fly."" After picking up the small brown bird, they wrapped it in a towel, settled it into their cabin, and named it Aaron Burrd – a playful nod to Aaron Burr from the musical Hamilton. She said once it was dry and warm, the bird's move quickly improved. ""It was very funny, playing with its reflection in the mirror and throwing my daughter's hairbands in the air,"" she said. Keen bird lovers, the family from Epsom, Surrey, said after researching the bird they discovered it was a corncrake. ""So this wasn't a usual situation,"" said Ms Halsey, who explained they then set out to find somebody who could look after the bird once they docked. ""At the time we didn't realise just how rare this was."" Derek Davey, who specialises in the rescue and rehabilitation of sea birds, met the family at Portland Port and took the bird into his care. He said: ""It must have landed on board when the ship was cruising around the Mediterranean. ""It is eating well but the problem now is that it needs to overwinter somewhere and then be taken back up north in the summer when the other corncrakes return. ""I feel very privileged to have seen one, but also quite nervous with the responsibility in looking after it."" He said that, because of its rarity, he was now working out where it should go next. Corncrake's have a distinctive ""crex crex"" call and spend the winter months in Congo in central Africa, migrating back to a few places across Northern Ireland and Scotland's islands and mainland to breed. Since the 1970s, the corncrake population has hugely declined, leading to them becoming a red-listed species in the UK and Ireland.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14p471ydy2o

The city council said storing them away and using them at a later date risked making some bacteria more resistant to antibiotics. Similarly, throwing them in the bin or down the sink meant they could end up in the environment and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. The authority said last year, about one in five serious infections in the West Midlands were resistant to antibiotics, which was the same as the previous year. The campaign in Wolverhampton coincides with World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, which aims to tackle the issue of viruses becoming resistant to medicines. The council said that if resistance continues to grow, common infections could become life-threatening and routine surgeries and treatments, like chemotherapy, could become much riskier ""More people could get seriously ill or die from infections that were once easy to treat,"" the authority said.

2025-11-20,Clarity needed before wind farm decision - report,science,BBC,"More information is needed before a proposal linked to an offshore wind farm in Jersey can move forward, the government has said. A report from Jersey's Cabinet Office said it would be premature to open a lease process due to ""current market uncertainty, geopolitical risk and unclear access to export markets"". But, findings from the report said it could bring ""significant economic benefits"". Environment Minister Steve Luce said he was confident the work completed so far would put Jersey in a ""strong position to shape its energy future"". ""This project is about looking ahead, ensuring that our decisions today create opportunities for the future,"" Luce said. ""I remain committed to an open, evidence-based approach, as we look to understand more about the opportunities jersey might have to enter global energy markets."" The report said: ""A decision should only follow once market conditions and access terms are clearly understood and shown to deliver a net benefit for islanders."" It said a decision could not be taken until the government ""clearly understood"" market access terms from the UK and France. The report added despite conversations with UK and French officials, it had not been possible to get into ""detailed discussions"" and until this happened, it would be too soon to open a lease process. The Offshore Wind Review Panel said while it was disappointed the leasing process had been delayed, it supported the decision. Deputy Hilary Jeune, chairwoman of the panel, said: ""This is a highly significant proposal for Jersey offering economic opportunity, but it comes with high costs and risks."" Jersey Electricity's chief executive Chris Ambler said he thought offshore wind was worth investigating. He said: ""We think it's an opportunity worth pursuing but the government is right to be cautious about how it approaches this because it is a very, very costly and not without risk to pursue these opportunities."" He said the challenge for Jersey was building an offshore wind farm of sufficient scale to achieve a price point. He explained: ""The issue for Jersey is we can't take that power in to Jersey itself, we can't absorb that scale of power, so to achieve a price point we have to build at scale and a good portion of that energy has to be exported to either the UK or French markets."" Mr Ambler asked: ""Is there a potential for Jersey with its water depths, its wind speeds, can it build a wind farm that is economically viable?""

2025-11-21,India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at COP30 climate summit,science,BBC,"At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter. India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being ""worryingly inadequate"". Delhi has argued otherwise. Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming. So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change. that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement. But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies. UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets. The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it. All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap. But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem. Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December. So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30? Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world. A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that ""global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone"". ""For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,"" he wrote. , Yadav seemed to expand on this argument. ""Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,"" he said. Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries. The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue. The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn. Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans. Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot. ""The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,"" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30. Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states. India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline. Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges. Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as "" It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C. Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal. , published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU. ""India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,"" a report by the think-tank noted. , India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia. But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan. And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8k8mlego

""Urgent action is needed to restore nature at scale and reduce threats like pesticide use, habitat loss, and climate change,"" she added. The number of bugs ""splatted"" on a vehicle licence plate is an indicator for insect populations in an area, with the annual survey providing crucial data about insect abundance. People are asked to count the bugs on their licence plates at the end of a journey. They use the Bugs Matter app to record trips over the course of five months, from May to September. In Northern Ireland, almost 12,000km (7,500 miles) were recorded in the latest survey, including journeys from Portrush to Crossmaglen.

2025-11-18,Travel warning as snow and ice move in across country,science,BBC,"The Met Office has warned that yellow weather warnings for snow and ice could impact travel in Scotland and northern England. Scattered showers of rain, sleet and snow are expected, with an ice alert in place for most of the central belt, southern Scotland and northern England until 11:00 on Wednesday. An alert for snow and ice has also come into force for all of northern Scotland including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, until 21:00 on Thursday. The Met Office said that 0.8in to 2in (2-5cm) of snow is possible at lower levels and as much as 4in (10cm) on higher ground. A snow and ice alert is in place for overnight, as well as an ice warning for and much of the Midlands in England. , a warning for snow and ice covers some eastern coastal areas and western coastal areas on Wednesday and Thursday. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has also for northern England and the Midlands which are valid until Saturday. It will turn less cold by the end of the week, with temperatures rising slightly to return to average at the weekend. Bear Scotland, which maintains Scotland's trunk roads, has reported ""snowy conditions"" across a number of routes in the north-west of Scotland, with snow ploughs out clearing the A82 and A9. Some Calmac ferry services have been affected by the weather conditions, with across routes on the west coast and Western Isles. ScotRail urged people to take care while travelling and to check the status of their entire journey before heading out. Gritters have been out overnight Stagecoach said customers would be updated about any changes on its app or social media channels. The Met Office advised that there was a chance of power cuts as well as road closures. A yellow warning means the weather is likely to have some impact for some people, but others will be able to carry on as normal. People are advised to keep an eye on the latest forecast to work out how much they might be impacted, especially if the weather gets worse. The coldest night since March was recorded on Saturday when temperatures dropped to -7C in Tulloch Bridge in the Highlands. Kirsty McCabe, from the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC Radio's programme people would notice the ""sudden switch"" to cold weather. ""November so far has been well above average, it's felt very mild,"" she said. ""This is the first proper cold snap of the season. It's really feeling quite wintery. Also, because we've got the snow and ice warnings out. ""Yes most of the snow will be above higher ground, across parts of northern Scotland but this evening could be quite a wintry mix coming down, even into the central belt to lower levels. So we could see a few flakes of snow this evening."" For those travelling to Hampden to see in the World Cup qualifier, Ms McCabe said it could be a bit sleety in places and ""maybe the odd rumble of thunder"". She said that although the snow was not likely to settle at lower levels it could be enough to cause disruption. ""It could make the roads more skiddy in places and could affect travel and the trains,"" she said. She added that the cold snap would last until the end of the week and by Friday morning temperatures could go down to -10C in some areas. However, she said temperatures would return to average through the weekend. Police Scotland said drivers should ensure their cars are roadworthy before heading out. Last week, Scottish transport operators This included stocking up on 497,000 tonnes of salt - more than was used for the entirety of last winter - and preparing 240 gritters to undertake salt spreading and snow ploughing patrols of the trunk road network. So far, November has been considerably milder than previous years. Typical overnight temperatures at this time of year range from 2C in Scotland to 5C in the south of England, but they rarely fell into single figures during the first week of November this year. Temperatures below -10C were recorded in some parts of northern Scotland last November, including Braemar in Aberdeenshire This week's weather will give us an early taste of winter, The forecast is for 1-2in (2-5cm) of snow on ground above 500ft (150m) across inland areas north of the central belt. On higher ground and higher road routes, the snow will be heavier, with a greater potential for some disruption. Some disruption is likely with ice, sleet and snow causing problems for travel during Tuesday morning, before easing into the afternoon. There's a little pocket of less cold air within the system, which means for much of the central belt and south, snow is likely to be on higher ground. But as the temperature drops on Tuesday night, snow may come to lower levels again for a time. Bitter north winds will surge across the country on Wednesday and Thursday, with frequent snow showers at sea-level across the north of Scotland and down some eastern and western coasts.

2025-11-18,Brazil creates new Indigenous territories during protest-hit COP30,science,BBC,"COP30 host Brazil has created 10 new Indigenous territories, with the climate summit hit by protests in recent days. The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced. The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. ""Each and every indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate and is a reason for us to feel happy,"" Dinaman Tuxá from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) told the BBC at COP30. The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree. Mr Tuxá said APIB wants more lands to be recognised legally, giving groups the right to control what happens to the land within the borders. ""Indigenous peoples today protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. If you demarcate indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected,"" he said. ""The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples protects the lands and automatically guarantees global warming will be tackled. Consequently the entire humanity benefits from it,"" he added. Some indigenous groups are attacked when they try to defend their land from cattle ranchers or groups trying to cut down trees for agriculture. On Sunday an indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community in the south of Brazil was killed during an attack, according to Survival International. Vicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was shot in the head when gunmen surrounded the village, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Survival International. Thousands protested on Saturday outside the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading ""demarcation now"". And last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read ""our forests are not for sale"" broke into the summit and tussled with security. Security around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside. But this remains the COP with the highest number of representatives from indigenous groups. ""This makes me very happy. We worked for two years and now we have at least 900 people inside the COP where they can negotiate and represent their communities,"" Kleber Karipuna, from APIB, told BBC News. More than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it ""contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment"". Past recognition of Indigenous reserves , in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation. Expanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee. The new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples. One area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon. The Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday. Until the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said. Under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced. to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands. Currently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory. Hundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census. of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change. Countries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them ""well below"" 2C. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0vekq12ro
2025-11-19,"First kiss dates back 21 million years, say scientists",science,BBC,"Humans do it, monkeys do it, even polar bears do it. And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing. Their study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in. The same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another. The scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom. By finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an ""evolutionary family tree"" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved. To ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a ""kiss"". , they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact ""with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer"". ""Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,"" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, ""it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed."" ""We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes."" In this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses. They focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss. The same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed. also showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva. ""That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,"" explained Dr Brindle. While this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why. There are already a number of theories - that it in our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way to Dr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question. ""It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,"" she said. ""We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43gq61g2qo

A report to North Somerset Council says it is ""not currently meeting the trajectory for reaching net zero by 2030"". While total emissions have fallen in North Somerset since the goal was set in 2019,  last year they increased. This was primarily because of ""a significant increase in fuel use"" by recycling vehicles, along with higher emissions from home to school transport. The council says that new recycling lorries, along with a reduction in collections to every three weeks, should bring emissions down. Lower emissions from street lighting and council-owned buildings are reported to have contributed towards ""significant progress"" but Cllr Annemieke Waite, cabinet member for planning and environment, said there remains ""much more to do"". There are also plans to decarbonise Hutton Moor Leisure Centre and introduce more electric buses. Ms Waite said she is writing to the government asking for more support in delivering climate objectives, with a North Somerset Council report saying there are ""limited resources and funding available"" to tackle the issue. The UK government has a target of reaching net zero by 2050, and has said it wants the country to be use only green electricity by 2030.

2025-11-18,Ten-hour mission to excavate huge whale head,science,BBC,"The two-tonne head of a whale that died after stranding in Cornwall has been excavated in a 10-hour mission, five years after its burial. As the local community had previously , a decision was made to keep part of it so it could eventually be displayed as a memorial. Scientist Robbie McDonald said he buried the skull on University of Exeter land in Falmouth to help prepare the bones for study and display, as it is the most natural way to clean them. ""Hopefully we can learn something about the marine environment that it came from but ultimately it will be a nice thing for people of Cornwall to remember this animal,"" he said. The 20m (65ft) whale stranded in Parbean Cove at the mouth of the Helford river, and the species is the second largest animal on Earth, after the blue whale. After gaining permission from the landowner - the Duchy of Cornwall - academics were able to take the whale's head for scientific purposes. The head was then buried on grounds at the university's Cornwall campus in Penryn, without many people being aware of the burial. ""It's fantastic we really didn't know how it was going to go not having seen it for five years,"" explained Prof McDonald. ""There were a few touch and go moments where just the sheer weight of it can fracture the skull. ""There's a few nicks and a few dings but nothing we can't handle, so I'm delighted and it's come out really clean too."" The story of the whale has been made into a BBC podcast, you can listen to all six episodes of An industrial vacuum machine, normally used to excavate buried utility cables, was used to help remove the soil from around the head which was then craned out of a 2m-deep (6.5ft) hole on university grounds. Dave Hatton, who runs a plant hire firm, helped bury and then dig up the whale. He said: ""It was a fair old weight, much harder to get it out of the ground than putting it in. ""I've been asked to help dispose of whales before with my digger but doing this is something a bit different isn't it?"" Paul White usually excavates live electricity and utility cables but on this job the former Royal Marine needed to get his head around the anatomy of a whale. He admitted he had done a bit of online research ""not how to excavate a whale but to learn about the whale's bone structure because I knew I was coming down here and I wanted to know roughly what I was coming against when I start excavating the ground"". Mr White was operating the vacuum excavator which sucked up the soil from around the skull to avoid any potential damage that digging could cause. ""This machine is usually for live electricity cables so that's how we treated it, really gentle like,"" he said. ""I was pretty convinced it would break though when we tried to lift it."" Usually whale carcasses are disposed of by the landowner but scientists, who hold a licence from Natural England, are allowed to take animal bones for scientific and educational purposes if permission is granted. ""There is so much to be done to improve the state of the natural environment,"" Prof McDonald added. ""There's a big global commitment to preserve and effectively manage about 30% of the sea by 2030 and we've got a long way to go."" He said the whale's skull was a ""gargantuan reminder of what we can do to improve the marine environment"". Part of the research on the bones would also be to see whether the process of decomposition in the soil had cleaned them of any remaining tissue, he added.

2025-11-17,From seabirds to sea turtles: the fatal toll of plastic revealed,science,BBC,"Scientists have analysed 10,000 marine animal autopsies to understand how plastic ingestion leads to death. The study found seabirds face extreme risk after swallowing just 23 pieces of plastic, giving them a 90% chance of dying. Marine mammals reach similar danger at 29 pieces, while sea turtles need to ingest around 405 pieces to hit the same threshold. The researchers were surprised by how little plastic can be dangerous - less than a soccer ball's worth of soft plastic by volume can be fatal to a dolphin, while a seabird might die from ingesting a few pieces of rubber smaller than the size of a pea. They say the findings could help shape global efforts to protect wildlife. ""It's a really important reminder that plastic pollution does pose an existential threat to ocean wildlife,"" said lead researcher, Dr Erin Murphy of the US-based environment group, Ocean Conservancy. The analysis used autopsy data from seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and dolphins, collected worldwide. Nearly half of the sea turtles studied, a third of the seabirds, and one in ten of the marine mammals had eaten plastic. The researchers estimated the death risks from swallowing different sorts of plastic in each group of marine animals. They found the type of plastic matters: rubber is most dangerous for seabirds; soft plastics and fishing debris pose the greatest risk to marine mammals; and both hard and soft plastics threaten turtles. The study examined only plastics found inside the stomachs of animals. It did not assess chemical impacts or entanglement, meaning the true scale of harm is likely to be higher. Hundreds of marine species have been found with plastic in their bodies. Birds often swallow plastic fragments, and turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Until now, however, scientists lacked precise data on how much plastic is lethal for animals of different sizes. Dr Murphy added: ""To effectively address plastic pollution, the science is clear. We need to reduce the amount of plastic we produce, improve collection and recycling, and clean up what's already out there.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5eyjd2zz7o

Holderness Hedgehog Hospital has been providing urgent care for sick and injured animals since 2016 and currently has about 60 hedgehogs in hospitals across Keyingham, Beverley, Burton Pidsea and Skeffling. The charity has been able to buy 42 new pods to temporarily house the animals in across all of its sites thanks to donations and a grant. Charity trustee Cath Novis said: ""I'm getting all tearful. It makes our lives and the hedgehogs' lives so much easier."" The new pods are split into two compartments, with one side for sleeping and one for eating and drinking. Ms Novis said they have made the volunteers' work much more efficient. ""Cleaning out a cage can be done in minutes rather than 10 or 15 minutes with the old noisy cages. ""It gives the hedgehogs much more room to be able to sleep in and they seem to find it better in there as well."" Due to the new pods' compact design, volunteers have also been able to increase the capacity at each hospital, meaning more hedgehogs can now be cared for. The charity was able to purchase the pods following donations from the public and volunteers, as well as a £5,000 grant from the Matthew Good Foundation and funding from the John Good Group. The charity said without the money, it would not have been able to expand until the end of 2026. Ms Novis added: ""I cannot begin to express what a difference it has made to us. ""I just can't believe how generous people have been. It's absolutely marvellous."" The charity, which is open all year, has about 50 volunteers working in various roles.

2025-11-18,"So long, plastic wet wipes - but should we be flushing the new ones?",science,BBC,"Long the scourge of water companies for blocking pipes, a ban on the sale of wet wipes made of plastic has been signed into law. The new rules will come into force in 2027 and will bring England into line with legislation across the rest of the UK. Plastic wipes don't disintegrate when flushed down the toilet, so when oil and fat congeal on them, so-called fatbergs form in sewers, which water companies say cost them £200m a year to clear. Most of the wipes that are sold in the UK are now made of non-plastic materials but the government and water companies say they should not be labelled as ""flushable"" because they can still cause blockages. The wet wipe manufacturers contacted by the BBC said their non-plastic ""flushable"" wipes have been thoroughly tested and comply with all the rules. Fatbergs can become huge if the blockage is not cleared. Just last month a massive stinking lump of wet wipes, fat and oil was removed from a west London sewer. It weighed the same as eight double-decker buses and took a specialist team more than a month to break down. The market for wet wipes has been growing steadily for years. According to government figures in 2023, of which about 12 billion contained plastic. If they were all laid out flat that's enough to cover 2,200 football pitches with plastic wipes. Though they welcomed the new legislation for England, water industry sources were also quick to point out its limitations. UK companies will still be able to manufacture and export plastic wet wipes, and they will still be available for people to buy from pharmacies both in person (behind the counter) and online. Businesses like hotels will be allowed to buy the wipes, without restrictions. , arguing that non-plastic wipes absorb too much of the detergents and disinfectants impregnated in them, with potential consequences for patient safety. At Minworth Wastewater Treatment works in the Midlands the scale of the current problem can be both seen and smelt. Minworth serves a population of more than two million people across Birmingham and the Black Country and Severn Trent, who run the facility, say 10 tonnes a day of wet wipes end up here. ""It's a nightmare,"" Grant Mitchell, Severn Trent's head of blockages says, as we survey a small mountain of wipes. He's just shown us the area where the ""un-flushables"" are filtered out from the sewage. It's grotty stuff. There are dead rats, a rubber duck as well as a huge ball of soiled wipes. ""Wet wipes are a problem because they're made to not break down like toilet paper,"" he says. ""So they stay in one piece, and they gather together with fat, oil, and grease from kitchens, congeal and create a fatberg which causes flooding."" Also on hand at Minworth is Emma Hardy the Minister for Water and Flooding. ""It's going to make a huge difference,"" Emma Hardy, the Minister for Water and Flooding, said of the ban as we sheltered from the rain at Minworth. ""I think people maybe underestimate the amount of problems that these wet wipes cause."" While many brands say their wipes are ""flushable"" and environmentally friendly, whether they can and should be disposed of down the toilet is being questioned. Daniel Jolly is researching how fast these biodegradable wet wipes break down. In a lab at the University of East Anglia in Norwich we watch as he simulates what a toilet flush does to a wipe. ""This isn't toilet paper"" he says as the wipe slowly breaks apart into fibres while he stirs the water inside an tank. ""Even though it's the same basic materials, this is built completely differently and it's much stronger."" Jolly has been carrying out tests on the banks of the River Yare to see how quickly the plastic-free wipes disintegrate. ""It's a period of most likely months to a year, or two years, depending on the environmental conditions that they're in,"" he says. ""That's much slower than toilet paper which is between weeks to several months, but much better than a plastic wipe which can last hundreds, even thousands of years in certain situations."" found that some non-plastic wipes failed tests on how fast they disintegrated, meaning they could still block sewers. Jolly is now looking at what impact the biodegradable wipes have on aquatic life as they fall apart. Until March 2024 the water companies ran a certification scheme which gave the green light for some wipes to be put in the toilet, called ""Fine to Flush"".  But that was among consumers and replaced with a new slogan ""Bin the Wipe"". Now the advice from the government and the water companies is very clear. Only the three P's - pee, paper and poo should be put down the toilet. ""Restricting the sale of wet wipes containing plastic is a step in the right direction,"" said a spokesperson for Water UK, the industry's trade body. ""But we really need a ban on their manufacture and mandatory 'do not flush' labelling on all wet wipes."" Some of the manufacturers who market ""flushable"" wipes told the BBC that they were in fact moist toilet tissues, but Water UK said it still viewed them as wet wipes so they shouldn't be flushed. ""I would encourage them [the wet wipe manufacturers] to show leadership on this right now,"" says Minister Hardy. ""Instead of marketing them as being flushable, provide labelling to inform the public that they need to bin them and not flush them down the toilets.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjr4gk7v38o

AJ Abrar, from Redditch, Worcestershire, jumped into the water at Arrow Valley Country Park on Wednesday to help four-year-old Bonnie who had been washed away. Last week, the West Midlands was hit by several flood alerts and river levels higher than usual. Mr Abrar said he was not losing hope of finding Bonnie, who has still missing and said he has since been referred for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) therapy. Discussing the incident, he said: ""It's been very traumatic. I've been in touch with counselling services who have referred me to my GP for PTSD therapy. ""I actually cheated death. I jumped in the river without thinking that I've got a little family here as well, my two girls. ""The water current was really fast flowing and we got stuck under a log. The river was full of debris and the water wasn't going on top of it, it was being sucked under it. ""I was holding onto Bonnie with my left hand and my right hand was on the log, holding us but the water just kept sucking us in."" Mr Abrar said he held onto his dog for as long as he could but said he was forced into a ""split second decision"". ""I looked at her, right in her eyes and she looked at me as well,"" he recalled. ""It was like a movie scene and I just let go and thought to myself 'this is it, I can't hold on anymore'.""

Council cabinet member for planning and environment Annemieke Waite told a full council meeting on 11 November that the red bags ordered for the trial of the scheme last November were fine and had remained in ""perfect condition"". But after handing them out to residents, she said they found there was ""a distinct problem with them"". ""Some of the red bags are fading and failing,"" she said. ""They are literally falling apart at the seams. We are not happy at all."" The council has now sent a team around to check what percentage of the bags are falling apart, as part of the council's agreement with its supplier. ""This is a very reputable firm. There are only two firms in the UK that do the bags that we are using and they are being used by so many different councils,"" Ms Waite said. ""We know that we are not the only council that has a problem."" Chair of the council Clare Hunt added: ""I know by trying to improve something we seem to have made things a little bit worse."" The red bags for plastic and metal recycling were introduced to 6,000 households in some areas in November 2024 on a trial basis.

Bethan Turner has described how she, her father and her boyfriend were left standing on the roof of their submerged Range Rover while holding on to a tree after their 4x4 was swept into fast-flowing water overnight. Her dad was driving back to Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, from Hereford station when it became ""stuck"" and they had to scramble on to its roof in the darkness, as fire crews tried to rescue them. She described their rescuers as ""absolutely incredible"". by South Wales Fire and Rescue Service with crews helping dozens of people to safety. The fire service said fast-moving water and blocked routes had created ""challenging"" conditions. Its teams have carried out rescues, evacuations and welfare checks, with Gwent Police, Welsh Ambulance Service and Monmouthshire council staff also providing assistance along with Sara (Severn Area Rescue Association), mountain rescue, Coastguard staff and members of neighbouring fire and rescue services. Firefighters dealt with about 85 flooding incidents and evacuations, it added. The service estimated 685 homes were without power which could not be turned back on because of the flood water. Meanwhile, a team of British Red Cross volunteers have been at Monmouth local leisure centre helping people who were evacuated. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has issued in Monmouth amid concern of a ""significant risk to life"" with the River Monnow reaching record levels, exceeding those recorded during Storm Dennis in 2020 and Storm Bert in 2024. Recalling her rescue, Bethan told fire crews were on either side ""trying to get to us, but the water was too deep and too strong for them to actually reach us"". She explained how their vehicle was pushed into the fast flowing water before being stopped by a tree and ""the second the car stopped, my dad yelled for us to all climb on to the roof"".

Roads flooded with vehicles passing through deep water in places following Friday's heavy rain, while train services were disrupted due to flooding and trees on lines. A number of events, such as Parkruns, were called off. In Herefordshire villagers, volunteers and fire crews spent the night pumping water out of buildings and trying to rescue stock. Several flood warnings remained in place across the region as well as more less severe flood alerts. Flood barriers were up in Bewdley, Worcestershire, and in Frankwell, Shrewsbury. In Herefordshire, flood water flowed ""like a river"" through Ewyas Harold damaging homes and businesses. The village fire station said flooding had been at a record high and crews had been busy all night with incidents in the centre. Sophie Wareing, who owns the village shop, said a lot of her stock had been ruined but the clean-up effort was ""what community spirit looked like"". ""We didn't even put a plea out, people just turned up,"" she added. Ms Wareing said it was ""essential"" that the shop reopened as soon as possible, as many elderly people relied on it. One resident, Claire, who has lived in Ewyas Harold all her life, said she and other volunteers were trained by the local fire service to allow them to respond to flooding. She was pumping water from The Dog pub when the water breached the barrier, and the situation changed ""dramatically"", she said. ""It changed very quickly from, 'lets see if we can save it, to we now need to get people out'."" ""[The water] was over waist deep and the current was just colossal.

2025-11-16,Data centre in the shed reduces energy bills to £40,science,BBC,"An Essex couple have become the first people in the country to trial a scheme that sees them heat their home using a data centre in their garden shed. Terrence and Lesley Bridges have seen their energy bills drop dramatically, from £375 a month down to as low as £40, since they swapped their gas boiler for a HeatHub – a small data centre containing more than 500 computers. Data centres are banks of computers which carry out digital tasks. As the computers process data, they generate lots of heat, which is captured by oil and then transferred into the Bridges' hot water system. Mr Bridges, 76, says keeping his two-bed bungalow near Braintree warm was a necessity as his wife has spinal stenosis and is in ""a lot of pain"" when it gets colder. ""It truly is brilliant,"" Mr Bridges continues. ""I'm over the moon that we got picked to trial this out. You can't fault the heating system – it is a 100% improvement on what we had before."" ""You don't need to go to a sauna after coming here,"" Mrs Bridges, 75, adds. The HeatHub was developed by Thermify and is part of UK Power Networks' , which aims to come up with innovative ways for low-income households to transition to net zero. Through SHIELD, the Bridges also had solar panels and a battery put in, which have contributed to their savings. Mr Bridges, a retired RAF sergeant, says despite putting ""the heating up fairly high to keep it nice and warm"", his bill has fallen to between £40 and £60 each month. ""I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly,"" he continues, ""we're not burning any gases, so it's green – it's environmentally friendly."" Thermify co-founder and CEO Travis Theune says the Bridges' HeatHub will eventually be part of a ""remote and distributed"" data centre, involving many units processing data for customers. While not designed for the heavy processing needed for artificial intelligence, Mr Theune says the system could run things like apps or analyse large volumes of data. He says the company wanted to design a system to provide both ""clean"" and ""affordable"" energy because ""finding a way to do both was a hard problem"". The project is still in the pilot phase, but in the future, clients will pay Thermify to process their data using the HeatHubs. Mr Theune adds the system provides ""clean, green heat at a low-to-no price point"" because ""the electricity that's generating that heat is paid for by somebody else"". The Bridges' landlord, social housing provider Eastlight Community Homes, is also part of SHIELD. Daniel Greenwood, Eastlight's head of asset management, says he hopes the next phase of the project will see 50 homes get HeatHubs, and adds: ""We've seen great results for the current installation, and although this is the first of its kind, we're looking to roll that out more broadly."" Jack McKellar, UK Power Networks’ innovation programme manager, says: ""We don't want anyone to miss out on the benefits of new and emerging technologies, as the UK moves towards a greener future."" Data centres help run the modern world. It is estimated they consume about 2.5% of the UK's electricity, and as more are built, their power demand could rise fourfold by 2030. Thermify is not alone in trying to capture and use the heat generated by data centres. is being warmed by a washing machine-sized ""digital boiler"". The company behind that scheme is also involved in a proposal to build the – a combined solar-powered data centre and district heat network in south Cambridgeshire. Milton Keynes University Hospital to be the first place in the city to benefit from £95m plans to share heat from a new data centre. , data centres use up to 30% of their electricity consumption on cooling. Mike Richardson, the 66-year-old founder and owner of DSM, says he had tried to incorporate ""nature"" as much as possible into his data centre at a former RAF base just off the A1 near Peterborough. A 200kW array of solar panels helps power it, and a 500 cubic-metre artificial lake cools it down. The lake is filled with water collected from the roof of an old aircraft hangar and pumped from two boreholes. Four heat exchangers are submerged in the 1.7 metre deep water, which is also home to dozens of koi carp and tench – fish that have their own role in the operation. ""We need to keep the pipes clean, and they eat the algae,"" Mr Richardson tells the BBC. With a 400kW capacity, the data centre is relatively small – or ""boutique"", according to Mr Richardson. Warm water is pumped from data racks to heat exchangers in the lake, then the cooled water is sent back inside, in a closed loop. Traditional cooling systems often rely on compressing a chemical coolant, which can be toxic. ""Keeping away from chemicals is an important thing for us,"" Mr Richardson says. He adds that because there was no need for compression, the setup used much less electricity for cooling. ""Yes, it works – it most definitely works,"" Mr Richardson says. But adds that relying on nature comes with ""challenges"" because ""nature by default is not something which is, you know, stable"". ""It takes a bit of management, but it's all doable,"" he continues. The system, while small-scale, can be scaled up with a larger body of water, he explains. ""Water is one of the best mediums for heat transfer,"" he says.

2025-11-16,Kew studies hot weather trees and new coffee types,science,BBC,"While the climate change convention COP30 takes place in Brazil, a team of scientists in London is working on finding ways to help our changing planet, and keep topping up our caffeine intake. The capital is the hottest part of the UK, and is home to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, where a new carbon garden has been created. The tree team have introduced Parrotia persica, known as the Persian ironwood, and Koelreuteria paniculata, also known as the golden rain tree. The coffee research team has been looking at crop species that can thrive in higher temperatures and under drought conditions. Head of tree collections at Kew, Kevin Martin, said the idea was to ""demonstrate what we should be looking at and what we can grow in the future when we think of our garden"". He said it was ""really hard to imagine how warm we're going to be - but this is November and we're in double figures. ""We should be in single figures right now and this is all having an impact on trees. ""What we will see is some trees will go into autumn really early, like the false autumns we see in the summer because they're really stressed so we won't see that big impactful change in colour."" He added that there were many plants we can plant but ""we need to start thinking outside the box and not go to our normal palette of trees"". He suggested trees like the Oriental hornbeam and the Persian ironwood ""provide amazing autumn colour but are really well suited to the future environment"". Head of coffee research at Kew, Dr Aaron Davis, said his team was trying to help the farmers that are being impacted by climate change. ""The way we're doing that is providing them with alternative coffee crop species so not Arabica, not Robusta but coffees that can thrive in higher temperatures, under drought conditions and are easier to grow for farmers. ""Around the world there are around 100 million people engaged in coffee farming and they need coffee to support themselves and their families so it's incredibly important.

Chanting and singing ""free the Amazon"", demonstrators in host city Belém have been carrying three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas flanked by two grim reapers. Indigenous groups displayed signs reading ""the answer is us"" as an inflatable elephant and anaconda weaved through the crowd under the hot sun. It is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks. The last three took place in countries that do not permit public protest. ""We are holding a funeral for fossil fuels,"" Tuga Cíntia told the BBC. She is from the theatre group Hydra Dance from the Federal University of Pará. ""I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act,"" she said. Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from across the world joined the march in their thousands. As the midday sun intensified, some sought shelter in a petrol station forecourt. ""Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change,"" Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa, a low-lying island extremely vulnerable to climate change, told the BBC. ""We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels,"" Ilan, from the non-governmental organisation 350, who lives in Brazil, said. Some carried signs reading ""demarcation now"", calling for indigenous groups to be given legal ownership of their territories. Hundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are regarded by experts as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests. Smaller sister protests have taken place around the world including in the UK. Security was tight at the COP30 venue as police with riot shields guarded the entrance. . The incident caused minor injuries to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue. Representation of indigenous voices has been a flashpoint in these talks, some of whom have set up stalls outside the fenced-off COP30 venue to sell products to passing delegates. The meeting was dubbed the ""indigenous people's COP"" but many groups feel their concerns over deforestation, land protection and resource extraction in their homes are not being heard. Negotiations continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday. Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change. Little progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels. President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon. But shortly before the talks opened last week, his government On Friday, analysis of attendee lists by the coalition Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies are attending the meeting. It suggests 1,600 lobbyists are in Belém, a 12% rise from the COP meeting last year. It is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals. With the US strikingly absent from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation to the talks, after President Donald Trump branded climate change ""a con"". Earlier in the week a group of senior climate leaders wrote a letter calling on the summit to ensure the facts about climate change were ""upheld. Ten countries have signed an initiative called Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change. It aims to create international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote evidence-based information on climate issues.

The Dulas Brook in Ewyas Harold reached record levels of 2.99m (9.8ft) while 80.6mm of rain was recorded in 12 hours in Suckley, Worcestershire. Flood warnings were in place in Shropshire and Worcestershire for the Severn, Avon and Teme rivers with levels peaking on Monday morning in Shropshire. Ewyas Harold village shop owner Bennie Krige was on holiday in South Africa when he saw the water rising on his CCTV and immediately booked a flight home. ""I was sat in Cape Town and I just knew that I needed to book a flight,"" he said. ""I sat having dinner with my wife and I just called for the bill and said 'we've got to get to the airport now, I've got to get on a plane' and so I jumped on a plane two hours later."" An investigation by Herefordshire Council began after last year's floods, but local people want something to happen now to prevent future flooding. Malcolm Watkins, from Ewyas Harold Group Parish Council, said: ""In a terrible way [it'll]... actually give us some impetus to move things forward more quickly than may have happened before."" Resident Carrie Gladwin stated: ""Just wonder whether we've seen a lifetime's event or whether it's just gonna happen again in four weeks' time. You just don't know."" The Temple Bar Inn owner Gino Fulgoni said: ""[You] just see it coming and what can you do? You just feel very helpless."" Barry Killner, response lead from the Environment Agency (EA), attended the village on Sunday to support residents. He said the agency had removed debris that had caused small blockages, such as a large tree trunk stuck under a bridge, and made plans to remove larger debris that had been moved by flood water. Matt Lawrence, from the EA, said: ""We learn from every flood event and we've got staff out liaising with those affected communities and over the coming months we'll be investigating if we can do anything more."" Travel continued to be disrupted with no rail services running between Shrewsbury, Hereford and Cardiff due to water on the line, while flood warnings were in place in Shropshire and Worcestershire for the Severn, Avon and Teme rivers. Transport for Wales warned passengers not to attempt to travel between Shrewsbury and Newport on Sunday. The train provider said no services were running due to flooding in multiple places along the line - which passes through Hereford and Leominster. It added that flooded roads meant rail replacement services were also not running and disruption was expected until the end of the day. Herefordshire Council said the A4110 in Eardisland was closed as vehicles had blocked the road and prevented work from being completed.

Demonstrators marched through the city centre on a day of global action to coincide with the COP30 climate talks in Brazil. Organisers Friends Of The Earth Scotland said it was the biggest climate march in Glasgow since Speakers at a rally on Glasgow Green afterwards included STUC deputy secretary Dave Moxham and Poverty Alliance chief executive Peter Kelly. Caroline Rance, Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns, said the turnout showed a growing desire for urgent climate action. She added: ""People came out in huge numbers to demand that better world we know is possible. ""There is energy and enthusiasm to make transformative change happen, all it requires is the political will."" Ms Rance said public concern about the climate emergency remained ""really high"". She continued: ""People recognise that the challenges our communities face, from Palestine to the Amazon, are deeply connected."" Ms Rance also highlighted positive climate action measures such as insulating homes and improving the country's bus services. Nick Cullen, of the Climate and Migrant Justice Organising Group, said the demonstration reflected a shared struggle across movements. He added: ""We joined this march because we must stand together against the deepening hostile environment, far right violence, and the erosion of climate action. ""Today showed that in these challenging times, our communities are stronger and more powerful when we come together."" A banner at the front of the procession declared ""a better world is possible"" as it set off through the city. Extinction Rebellion supporters brought along a mobile sound system, while a choir performed reworked Christmas carols. They adapted the lyrics to voice opposition to the Rosebank oil field, located west of the Shetland Isles. A group of children also chanted ""Stop Rosebank, the planet is for everyone"" - in reference to - as they moved through the city centre. One activist wore a Donald Trump mask and held a sign that read: ""It's capitalism, ya eejits"". The Climate and Migrant Justice Organising Group and the Gaza Genocide Emergency Committee were among the groups taking part. Palestinian flags also were visible throughout the march in a show of solidarity with people in Gaza. John Hilley, of the Gaza Genocide Emergency Committee in Glasgow, said the fights for human rights and environmental protection were inseparable. He added: ""We must act together and with urgency against the same corporate and political forces behind those existential threats."" The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than 69,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable. Martin Canavan was at the protest with his daughter, Ailsa. He told BBC Scotland News they wanted to take part because ""urgent action"" was needed to tackle the ""climate emergency"". ""We need to make sure we are doing everything we can to improve the lives of people who are furthest away from power,"" he said. ""We want to make sure we can be part of the collective voice calling for change."" Ailsa, nine, said she wanted to come to the protest ""because there is no planet B"".

She added: ""I want us to be able to live and have a happy life without any gas or anything."" Anna Brown was also among those protesting and said that she didn't feel politicians were doing enough to act on the issue of climate change. She said: ""It says something that we're on COP30 - if something is working, why do we need it for 30 years? ""Why does the process continue to fail us nationally, internationally and locally? ""We're not seeing the change we need and people are continuing to suffer."" Ms Brown added that her biggest worry was thinking about the future. ""People ask 'what are you going to do? But that's so hard to plan for when you look around and realistically by 2050 the Clyde will be flooding and our energy bills go up everyday. ""Even as a uni student I worked three jobs and we shouldn't have to do that but that's the only way we can afford to live. ""And that's not just for young people, that's for everyone.

Cases rose to 28.2 per 100,000 population in 2024 compared to 25.9 cases per 100,000 in 2023, the report found. Dr Chaam Klinger, consultant in health protection at UKHSA South West, said the 9% increase was ""concerning"" and ""antibiotic resistance remains one of the greatest health threats we face"". Vanessa Carter had a car accident in 2004 that required multiple facial reconstructive surgeries. She then developed a persistent Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection around her facial implants. Ms Carter, who lives in Torbay, said for 11 months she was repeatedly prescribed courses of antibiotics from different specialists but was unable to get rid of the infection permanently. After laboratory testing, she found out MRSA was resistant to the antibiotics she had been taking. She said: ""I had to have part of my face amputated because of this resistant infection, and was eventually treated with 'last resort' antibiotics. ""The rise in antibiotic-resistant infections we are seeing concerns me deeply - nobody should have to go through what I experienced."" Ms Carter added: ""I think that if you are prescribed antibiotics, as I was, if you see that your infection is not getting better from an antibiotic - go back to your doctor and question - why is this antibiotic not working? ""It's really important that we are empowered as patients to be able to ask those questions."" Dr Klinger said the 9% increase was ""concerning"". She said: ""Antibiotic resistance remains one of the greatest health threats we face, and whilst we continue to have the lowest rate in England, the upward trend demands our attention. ""We are working closely with healthcare partners across the region to ensure antibiotics are only used when absolutely necessary."" Dr Klinger said people should only take antibiotics when a healthcare professional tells them to and complete the course exactly as prescribed. She added people should return unused antibiotics to a pharmacy and not to save them for later or share with others.

Soil from a Roman cemetery in Canterbury was X-ray scanned to image hobnails from leather footwear contained within, even though the leather had disintegrated. The scans were used to identify shoe designs and sizes, according to the study, providing ""a tantalising glimpse into the clothing habits of the deceased"". Study co-author James Elliott said shoes were ""an important part of the Roman psyche"" and that the evidence found could be used ""to reconstruct the profile of who these people were"". Researchers believe the Rhodaus Town burial site, which has become student accommodation since the 2019 dig, was active between the late 3rd Century and the mid-5th Century AD. Over 200 graves were found at the site, of which about 50 contained hobnails. A range of footwear designs were identified, according to a study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. Some examples with many hobnails suggested design for ""outdoor activities in keeping with robust boots"" but others had ""a more delicate design suited to towns and villas"", the study reported. Mr Elliott, the course director in diagnostic radiography at Canterbury Christ Church University, told the BBC various styles ""can be linked to what age of Roman Britain this is most in fashion"". Researchers wrote that the designs matched other examples found elsewhere within Britain and the wider Roman Empire, which ""reaffirms a common cultural affinity"". Shoe styles were ""almost the same across the whole empire and that's why it makes it so useful for dating of sites"", Mr Elliott said. The study found the hobnail patterns could indicate information about a deceased person, such as their biological sex and social status, even without skeletal remains. Study co-author Adelina Teoaca, of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said the research showed that ""even small traces like nails from shoes can add a human dimension to the study of Roman burials"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7ez61pk1eo
2025-11-14,Peter Higgs leaves Nobel Prize medal to Edinburgh University,science,BBC,"The late Prof Peter Higgs has gifted his Nobel Prize medal to the university where he proposed a groundbreaking idea that would change scientists' understanding of the universe. Prof Higgs was a researcher at Edinburgh University in 1964 when he predicted the existence of a sub-atomic particle which gives other fundamental particles their mass. The particle, known as the Higgs boson, would not be confirmed for 50 years, with experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, finally confirming his theory in 2012. He was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics with Francois Englert in 2013. Edinburgh University said Prof Higgs left the medal to the institution in his will, following his death last April at the age of 94. Prof Sir Peter Mathieson, principal and vice-chancellor of the university, said: ""This generous gift will ensure that Peter Higgs's extraordinary contributions to science will continue to inspire generations of students and researchers. ""We are profoundly honoured to have been entrusted with his Nobel Prize medal, an object of immense historical significance and a lasting emblem of his legacy."" The medal will be preserved by the university's centre for research collections and will be displayed at events and exhibitions, including the upcoming Higgs Lecture in 2026. Prof Neil Turok, Higgs chairman of theoretical physics at the university, told BBC Radio's programme what it was like to work with his late colleague. ""He was a very unusual person and is very warmly remembered in the physics department,"" he said. ""He was a very shy and private man. A very unlikely figure to discover what is one of the most important foundations of our descriptions of the laws of nature."" He said Prof Higgs made his discovery in a ""very unexpected way"" in 1964. ""He put various ideas together, which has been around, but he finally saw how the jigsaw puzzle worked,"" he said. ""He wrote a very short paper, just one-and-a-half pages, many people thought it was ridiculous, and it took a long time for the idea to be accepted."" The theory was proved 50 years later with the Large Hadron Collider. Prof Turok added: ""What it shows though is something about nothing in a sense. Before Peter Higgs we thought of the vacuum as being empty and what he discovered is actually the vacuum is full of stuff. It's like the sea."" He said Edinburgh encouraged free thinking and independence of mind, which he thought suited Prof Higgs ""perfectly"". ""It allowed him a lot of space to be adventurous, and he was a very adventurous mind but an incredibly shy person who hated attention,"" he said. ""He was like a very recluse would-be Scot."" Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1929 and joined Edinburgh University in 1960.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp40mv3veo

2025-11-14,Concern over solar farms 'triple the size of Gatwick',science,BBC,"An area of Romney Marsh more than three times bigger than Gatwick Airport could be lost to huge solar farms, claims one countryside charity. CPRE said that, if approved, the Shepway, South Brooks and South Kent Energy Parks would damage an area of Kent containing both ""unique and fragile wildlife habitats and some of the UK's most productive farmland"". ""The transition to renewables does not need to come at the cost of the countryside,"" said CPRE Kent director Andrea Griffiths. Three energy companies - SSE Renewables (SSE), EDF Power Solutions UK/PS Renewables and Low Carbon respectively - are responsible for the projects. CPRE has suggested that solar panels could be set up on the rooftops of ""suitable domestic and industrial buildings, as well as on car parks"". The charity added this method would ""easily deliver"" more than 60% of the government's target for solar energy, which was published in June. Jackie Copley, national CPRE campaigns leader, said these projects would result in ""vast fields of solar panels"" dominating the area. A spokesperson for SSE Renewables said the feedback received following a recent local consultation was ""helping inform the project's ongoing design"" ahead of the expected publication of a preliminary environmental impact report next spring. They said: ""This report will provide a detailed assessment of our project proposals covering a range of important topics including visual impact, landscape, land use, local heritage, and biodiversity, and we will make this report available to the public for review once it's published."" A spokesperson for the South Brooks project said there was a commitment to ""designing South Brooks in a way which respects this unique environment"". They said: ""To do this, we are engaging with developers of other projects and experts such as local wildlife groups, the RSPB and Natural England, as well as carrying out a number of surveys to enhance our understanding of the local area."" A spokesperson for Low Carbon said: ""South Kent Energy Park has the potential to play a crucial role in supporting the UK's decarbonisation targets, powering over 140,000 homes with clean, secure energy each year.

2025-11-14,Passengers frustrated at flooded rail line issues,science,BBC,"Rail passengers and campaigners are calling for change amid a series of issues on a stretch of railway line in Devon. Delays and cancellations of services, flooding, and overcrowding on the Tarka Line, between Barnstaple and Exeter, have frustrated rail users and campaigners. Tim Steer, chair of Railfuture in Devon and Cornwall, said the various issues on the line in recent weeks were due to its ""Victorian infrastructure"". Network Rail said it was working with Great Western Railway (GWR) to ""keep passengers on the move"" with rail tickets usable on replacement buses. It said it would get services back up and running ""as soon as possible"". In recent days services have been suspended between Barnstaple and Crediton due to flooding. Network Rail said in order for services to restart, specialist diving teams would need to inspect the structures when water levels subsided. A spokesperson said it was ""difficult to put a timescale on"" when it would be able to complete the necessary inspections. Conor Warren, from Ilfracombe and a business student at Exeter College, said his experience of getting the train over the last couple of months had been ""a nightmare"". He gets a bus from Ilfracombe to Barnstaple and then a train to Exeter, and vice versa on the way home. ""I've found with the delays, every time I've tried to get the train it's either been cancelled or delayed, and with the delay the bus doesn't line up and then I'm waiting another hour for the next bus. ""It's every time I've travelled over the last couple of months it's been a real big issue."" Mr Warren said ""on a good day"" the journey from Ilfracombe to Exeter took about two hours. He said currently, it was taking between three and four hours each way. ""It's actually quicker for me to get to London than it is for me to get to Ilfracombe..."" He said when he had managed to get on the train it was ""overcrowded"" and he had struggled to find a place to stand. Mr Steer said recent issues with overcrowding on the line between north Devon and Exeter showed the line needed to be modernised. He said: ""They're [GWR] going from one crippling challenge to the next, whether it's the overcrowding from last week... to this week where the line is not even open, so this Victorian infrastructure needs to be addressed."" Mr Steer said it was important to ""raise the level of the profile"" of the Tarka line, as investment was needed to prevent issues like this in the future. A spokesperson for GWR said it was aware that some trains immediately before and after the start of the college day were in demand, and with non-Exeter College travellers using the route it was over capacity on some services during peak times. It said over the last 12 weeks 95% of the almost 3,000 trains from Barnstaple had run, and of those 91% arrived within 10 mins. It couldn't run more trains because the branch line was at capacity and it couldn't run longer trains because the platforms were not long enough, which was ""a really expensive solution we would need funding for,"" GWR said. It said the short term solution was more trains and carriages with selective door opening and it hoped the introduction of Class 175 trains would help. It added: ""We are however supportive of campaigns to upgrade the infrastructure of the North Devon Line, with more passing loops and a better signalling system to allow improved performance and the aim of 30-minute frequency to Barnstaple. ""Network Rail are currently carrying out a feasibility study to understand the costs of this."" Network Rail has been approached for comment on the infrastructure of the line. David Northey, chair of the North Devon Line Rail Promotion Group, said the closure on the Tarka Line had a ""significant impact"" on communities in the region. He said: ""For many residents, the railway is not a luxury – it is an essential lifeline for work, education, healthcare and access to wider opportunities."" Mr Northey said the disruption highlighted ""the urgent need for sustained investment in the resilience of the route"". Bryony Chetwode, secretary for Travelwatch SouthWest, said the disruption was ""really serious"". She said: ""We've really wanted to achieve this shift to get kids on to the trains... so to suddenly not be able to get into college or not get into work is really, really major and important. ""We are looking at improvements at Okehampton, we've got the new station at Okehampton coming soon, and yet the infrastructure here hasn't been sorted out.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jgln3184o

Historic Environment Scotland (HES) said Holyrood Park rangers discovered the bones on Crow Hill during a routine patrol in the aftermath of the blaze, which The remains are thought to come from cattle, horses, sheep, goats and possibly even cats and could be as old as the 16th Century. They were removed from the area and archaeologists are analysing them to learn more about how old they are and why they were left in the park. Arthur's Seat was evacuated after the fire rapidly spread across the hill in the centre of the city in August. There is no exact cause but fire chiefs believe it was HES said the bones were discovered very close to the remains of a prehistoric hillfort which once enclosed the summit of both Crow Hill and Arthur's Seat. An HES spokesperson said: ""The remains do not seem to have been part of a wider feature and are thought to be post-medieval or modern in date, however the number and variety of bones make it an unusual – and potentially significant – discovery. ""AOC Archaeology, HES's archaeological call-off contractor, carefully removed the remains and they are now being analysed by specialists. ""Samples will be submitted for radiocarbon dating which will tell us more about the age of the bones and why they may have been deposited there."" Humans have used Holyrood Park stretching back at least 7,000 years. HES said it had previously found evidence of farming, hunting, worship, army encampments and royal pageantry in the park.

2025-11-14,Rare Bronze Age log boats displayed for first time,science,BBC,"Rare Bronze and Iron Age log boats unearthed upstream from have gone on display for the first time. The vessels have been painstakingly conserved since their discovery at Must Farm quarry in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, between 2011 and 2012. Three of the nine excavated boats form the heart of a new permanent exhibition at Peterborough's Flag Fen Archaeology Park. ""This is our heritage, this is what our ancestors were doing 3,000 years ago,"" said general manager Jacqueline Mooney. ""Nowhere in the world is there another collection of so many man-made log boats...  and they belong to us: the people of the Fens, the people of Peterborough."" Must Farm settlement, with its treasure trove of preserved everyday artefacts, was excavated by Cambridge Archaeological Unit (CAU) a few years after the boats' discovery. Flag Fen visitors can see a 6.3m (20ft 6in) Middle Bronze Age oak vessel; a 2.2m (7ft 2in) fragment of a Middle Bronze Age oak boat with an intricate repair on its hull; and a 0.8m (2ft 6in) fragment of an Early Bronze Age boat made from maple. CAU archaeological researcher Iona Robinson Zeki said: ""They reveal that these simple yet supremely effective boats were used to navigate a fenland river for almost a millennium."" The vessels, which ranged in age from nearly 2,500 to about 3,500 years old, also revealed fascinating details about prehistoric carpentry and construction techniques. Ms Mooney said: ""It's a fantastic thing to think [they were] hewn out of solid logs 3,000 years ago with just bronze axes - and you can see the axe marks."" Their preservation was made possible by funding from a number of sources, including the landowner and developer Fonterra. There were also grants of more than £73,000 from Historic England and almost £49,000 from Peterborough City Council. Ms Mooney said the boats were soaked in a solution of water and polyethylene glycol, known as peg wax, for 10 years. ""Once they are structurally sound, we take them out of the water and dry them intensely, we clean all the wax off and then join them together again to look like boats,"" she added. Ms Mooney paid tribute to the skills of the park's conservator Mary Evans, under expert guidance from York Archaeological Trust. ""She has spent many hours of her life holding teeny tiny bits of the boat together so they adhere back together, the job she has done is fantastic and I'm so proud of the work Mary and her team have done,"" she said. Claudia Kenyatta and Emma Squire, co-CEOs of Historic England, said the boats ""represent an extraordinary window into our prehistoric past"".

2025-11-14,Hospital trust launches clinical recycling scheme,science,BBC,"A hospital trust is partnering with an environmental charity to turn non-infectious clinical waste into reusable training tools. The University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust has been running a pilot scheme with The Wombles Community Charity across its seven hospitals for the last 12 months. Approximately £35,000 was saved and the scheme diverted 25,000 clinical items from incineration, the trust said. ""The Wombles reuse and repurpose programme is now being offered to all NHS trusts and is set to save millions every year,"" a scheme spokesperson said. Dedicated waste bins have been implemented throughout hospitals to collect non-infectious clinical waste. Transported to a nearby staff training facility, the waste is then re-used in simulation settings, where non-sterile medical items are needed on a daily basis. Julie Turner, from the Association for Simulated Practice in Healthcare, said: ""So many items end up as clinical waste simply because they can't be used with patients – but in training, they're invaluable. ""By repurposing instead of disposing, we save money, reduce waste, and create more realistic learning environments for NHS staff."" Items unsuitable for training are donated to humanitarian projects abroad, including mannequins, catheters and cannulas.

2025-11-14,Puffins return to island for first time in at least 25 years,science,BBC,"in County Antrim for the first time in years, after a major scheme to remove invasive brown rats. It is the first time the vulnerable seabird has been recorded on the tiny island off Islandmagee since Ulster Wildlife took over the management of the seabird sanctuary 25 years ago. A programme of rat eradication began in 2017 and winter grazing has now been implemented to keep vegetation low, so predator cover is reduced. The charity's nature reserves manager Andy Crory said the discovery of the puffins ""proves seabird restoration works"". Five puffins were spotted in 2024. Then in spring this year, cameras set up as part of the rat eradication programme caught two puffins coming and going from a nesting burrow on the cliff ledges. Their behaviour, bringing food back to the nest, was a positive sign that they were breeding. For Mr Crory, tales of puffins once breeding on the Isle of Muck ""felt more like folklore"", but the myth is now becoming a reality. ""Seabirds face immense challenges globally, with 24 of the 25 breeding species at risk of local or global extinction,"" he said. ""So, while a handful of puffins on a tiny island may seem small, this moment is huge – it proves that seabird restoration works."" The puffin sightings are the latest in a long line of positive signs of the impact conservation management has been having on the island. Annual surveys have begun to record steady increases in eider ducks, guillemots, herring gulls and lesser-backed gulls on and around the island, year on year. It is not known for certain that the puffins seen this year managed to successfully rear a chick. But Mr Crory is staying positive. ""Our hope is that the Isle of Muck will become a thriving stronghold for puffins and, in time, tempt back other lost species like the Manx shearwater. ""For now, we're waiting with great excitement to see if the first 'pufflings' – baby puffins – appear on the cliffs next summer. ""That truly would be the icing on the cake."" Puffins are a priority species in Northern Ireland and red-listed in the UK, putting them in the highest conservation concern bracket due to food shortages, climate change, and predation by invasive species. They spend most of their lives at sea, only returning to land to breed in spring and summer at the same nesting site with the same partner, year after year. Each pair raises a single chick during the breeding season. Ulster Wildlife said rats are a major issue for many seabird islands across the UK, posing a threat to eggs and chicks. The Isle of Muck is not accessible to the public and it is hoped that isolation will help the birds to return safely next summer. Similar rat removal projects have been carried out elsewhere to help seabirds bounce back. The LIFE Raft project on Rathlin Island is expected to have when it publishes its latest report soon.

2025-11-13,Treasure finds in England reach record high,science,BBC,"Treasure finds in England have hit a record high, with a lamp shaped like a human foot and an earwax scoop among the more unusual items unearthed. Provisional government figures recorded by the British Museum's Portable Antiquities Scheme show 1,446 discoveries in England in 2024 - up from 1,266 the previous year. A treasure find can include multiple items, and eastern England has proved the jewel in the nation's crown, with 388 finds last year. Many are uncovered by metal detectorists like Emma Youell, who estimates she has found thousands of artefacts and describes herself as a ""massive history nerd"". Emma says the most valuable part of finding treasure is knowing that recording it contributes to our understanding of history. ""I found a hammered coin, a silver penny with Henry VIII's portrait in it – so we're going back to the Tudors. ""I've had gold coins from Iron Age tribes - they're about 2,000 years old."" For the first time, the 2024 finds include two objects that meet a new definition of treasure. Previously treasure had to be at least 300 years old and made in part of precious metal such as gold or silver, or part of a hoard. From July 2023, this was expanded to objects at least 200 years old and deemed to be of outstanding historical, archaeological or cultural significance, regardless of what type of metal they are made from. The 2024 provisional figures show a further 85 treasure finds in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland, which has on searching for archaeological objects. Scotland has a separate law for treasure trove and so its figures have not been included. The first under the new definition, , was in England's treasure capital, Norfolk, which had 138 finds in 2024 - the most of any county. Dr Helen Geake, Norfolk finds liaison officer, said the area may be the highest for finds due to being rich with arable fields, historically well-populated and good for collaboration between detectorists and archaeologists. ""It's the first official coin issued by Aethelstan,"" she said. ""A proper government coin"". It was minted by a Viking warlord after he became a Christian king, known as Aethelstan II. One picture of the Vikings, she says, is of them ""being raiders and pillagers and attacking monasteries - then they turn into these more peaceful Norse settlers"". ""This coin sums up the turning point between the frightening Vikings who are attacking us, and the settler Vikings who actually are The second was a Roman copper alloy lamp in the shape of sandaled foot, discovered by a study group in Kent while exploring what is believed to be a small Roman fort. , it is the first known example of its type to have been found in Britain. A metal detectorist first saw the chain of the lamp before uncovering the whole thing. ""It's the most astonishing thing,"" said Dr Geake. ""Roman foot-shaped artefacts appear to have had a number of meanings connected with the cult of Isis. They're also noted as being novelty items."" One of Dr Geake's favourite items is a Roman ear scoop. ""Apparently they're used to scoop out your earwax, as if your fingernail won't do,"" she said. ""You're probably looking at it more closely than anybody since the owner who lost it - and it brings you into a weird, otherworldly kind of contact with that owner. ""It's just a lovely object and when I record objects like this I think 'Gosh, I really do have the best job in the world' - seeing these personal items, looking after them for a bit and giving them a new life."" Emma says she has been out detecting nearly every weekend since starting the hobby 12 years ago. The 34-year-old from Kent was the youngest in her metal detecting group and one of the only women. Now, she sees more women and young people get involved and helps run a Facebook group for female detectorists. ""I've got a camper van so it allows me to get out and around the country,"" she said. ""My husband knows I'm a massive history nerd. He's very happy for me to just go off on a Sunday and do my thing. It's just what I love to do."" She also enjoys doing a ""weekender"" - camping on a farm with fellow detectorists and the farmer's permission - from Friday until Sunday. ""We'll all have a little barbeque or something together - it's very social,"" she said. ""Masses of people form great friendships across the UK"". Dr Geake believes treasure finds have been rising in England because there are now more detectorists, more knowledge about why to report things and the impact of ploughing into archaeological sites. ""You can't blame a farmer for ploughing up an archaeological site they didn't know was there already,"" she said. ""There are such pressures, particularly on small farms. There has to be some kind of discussion with land owners, with archaeologists, with the general public. ""How much do we want to save our historic environment and what resources are we prepared to put into it?"" Julian Evan-Hart from Essex, editor of Treasure Hunting magazine, has had his finds appear in museums. However, one of his favourite things is reuniting people with sentimental objects. He has found wedding rings, baby jewellery and even the cap badge from where an elderly woman's father crashed a plane decades before. ""This was a tiny crumpled piece of copper - intrinsically worth nothing but the value to his daughter... ""We have this conception of treasure - gold and silver - but we shouldn't get blighted by that because the tiniest, most insignificant object to one individual somewhere in the world can mean more than that. ""The greatest thing about this hobby is yes, what we find, but the ability to share it with other people."" In 2023, 1,358 treasure finds were initially recorded, which was amended to 1,343 as some finds had not been resolved at publication. As an individual ""treasure find"" can be made of multiple artefacts, these numbers actually represented 32,768 artefacts. The provisional figures for treasure finds in 2024 will be confirmed in 2026 along with how many individual artefacts they include.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly90nl202go
2025-11-12,Heavy rain causes flash flooding with more to come,science,BBC,"Heavy rain has caused flash floods and has led to warnings of rising river levels in the West Midlands. Flood water has been reported on streets in Birmingham causing delays and road closures. National Highways closed two lanes of the M5 near Halesowen on Tuesday evening after flooding on the motorway, but all lanes had reopened by Wednesday morning. The Environment Agency has issued several flood alerts in across the wider region. A yellow warning for rain has been issued for Friday with one forecaster saying it could be the wettest day so far this autumn. A flood warning was issued for the Illey Brook in Halesowen but it has since been downgraded. The Met Office has warned of further ""heavy and prolonged rain"" across the West Midlands on Friday and Saturday, which it said could lead to flooding and disruption. Majid Mahmood, The Birmingham city councillor responsible for transport, urged people not to drive or walk through flooded areas, where he said ""the water can be far deeper and faster moving than it appears"". He said the authority was working to manage flooding and clear blocked drains and suggested people contact their local councillor to tell them about flooding issues. Bruce Lines, a city councillor for the Bartley Green area, said the flooding had caused ""gridlock"" there four or five times in the past 12 months. He said the area had seen an ""exceptional amount of rain"" in the past 24 hours and ground water had risen, with a particular problem around Adams Hill.

Emma Reynolds told MPs she was ""holding Southern Water to account"" about the spill at Camber Sands and has called for a thorough investigation. Southern Water apologised for the spill, which prompted a clean-up operation by the local council and volunteers. The company said on Thursday it had ""committed to an independent investigation into the cause"". Southern Water previously said it was likely that the beads - used in the water treatment process - had come from the Eastbourne wastewater treatment works. Reynolds told the House of Commons the authorities' immediate priority was to ""address the damage caused"". She added: ""We need to ask questions about why this wasn't uncovered earlier."" during heavy rainfall, after the failure of a screening filter which should have stopped them escaping. was spotted on 28 October, but it was not known at the time whether any pellets had escaped. In the Commons, Eastbourne MP Josh Babarinde warned of ""catastrophic failures"" by Southern Water in the region. The Liberal Democrat described a ""stench stinking out"" the town ""and a matter of days ago, the accidental discharge of millions of plastic bio-beads into our sea"". Babarinde asked for a meeting with ministers to discuss how they could ""force Southern Water to finally get a grip of their appalling failures"". A spokesperson for Southern Water said: ""Further investigations, including draining a large tank over the past 24 hours, have uncovered vastly more beads still in the system at Eastbourne than originally anticipated. ""This means substantially fewer beads - less than 10 tonnes - have entered the environment."" The company says about 80% of the beads that washed up on the beach have been removed as a result of the clean-up operation, led by Rother District Council. Coastal officers told the BBC on Thursday they had found a dead porpoise, gannet, seal and swan in the area in the last two weeks. They said that was ""unusual"" but could not be sure the incidents were related to the beads. Environment Minister Emma Hardy visited Camber Sands on Thursday afternoon to view the clean-up. She said: ""When you see this amount of pollution it's incredibly saddening and it makes you quite angry that this has been allowed to happen.""

2025-11-12,Woman fulfils childhood dream of rearing an emu,science,BBC,"A late night shopping spree turned into a dream come true for one animal lover after she successfully hatched an emu egg. Rhi Evans, from Cirencester, Gloucestershire, has no memory of buying the egg but woke one morning in 2022 to an email confirmation from eBay saying it was on its way. Unable to secure a refund, Ms Evans, who has a lifelong fascination for large  prehistoric birds, decided to ""wing it"" and try and hatch it on her three-acre farm. Ms Evans adapted her property to rear the chick, but an expert in emu care warned the birds were ""not pets for a casual keeper"". Ms Evans had been scrolling through eBay one night, aimlessly adding ""random things"" to her basket when she bought the £37 egg. Describing the moment it arrived, she told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: ""It was absolutely incredible. They are just the most amazing things, they look almost like dragon eggs."" She continued: ""At that point I thought, well I've always had this fascination with large birds and it's always been a dream of mine to own one."" ""I've sort of got myself into this situation now, so what's the harm in trying?"" Ms Evans purchased zoo-grade equipment and repurposed the stables on her land in preparation. Throughout the two-month incubation process she had to carefully turn the egg several times a day. But she watched the emu's due date come and go, and conceded it was not meant to be.

She named the chick Jonathan before discovering she was female. Three years later, the six-foot bird now lives with her at home, roaming the fields and cosying up under a heat lamp. While Jonathan is now an integral part of her life, Ms Evans warns rearing an emu is not a decision to be taken lightly. ""They require a huge amount of commitment, their life span is 35-40 years so you've got to be in it for the long haul,"" she said. Helen Goldman, from West Country Emu Services, agreed the birds were not ""pets for a casual keeper"", and urged potential owners to ensure they were equipped. ""They're large, powerful animals that need plenty of space, as they can run up to 30mph. Their food is a specialist ratite diet, which can be costly, and they also need a minimum of six-foot fencing,"" she said. ""These are wonderful, intelligent birds, but they deserve homes that truly meet their needs."" Ms Evans is now considering finding Jonathan a mate, but will not be turning to eBay again. ""I leave my phone in a separate room now because I dread to think what will appear on my email confirmation the next day. I definitely do not recommend late night shopping on eBay,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3yg5g5lpo
2025-11-12,Flood defence barriers go up as more rain forecast,science,BBC,"Flood defences will go up in a Worcestershire town where the River Severn is prone to burst its banks. The lower stages of the Severnside flood barrier in Bewdley will be deployed at 07:30 GMT on Thursday, the Environment Agency (EA) said. Heavy rain has already affected part of the region with several flood alerts being issued and residents of Whittern Way, Hereford, suffering the effects of flash flooding on Tuesday evening. It comes ahead of a Met Office yellow weather warning that heavy and prolonged rain was expected on Friday which could lead to flooding and disruption, including difficult driving conditions, road closures and delays or cancellations to bus and train services. Whittern Way resident Philip Davies told BBC Hereford and Worcester: ""We noticed [the water] coming up and it was coming up at a fair rate of knots. ""It was ongoing all night and the fire brigade were pumping out some properties close by."" He added that on Wednesday morning the water had cleared within 15 minutes after the drains were unblocked. Earlier, the EA issued a flood warning in Halesowen and and surrounding Shropshire and Staffordshire. Steve Jackson, from the Bablake weather station in Coventry, said Friday was set to be the wettest day of the autumn so far and that it could be windy too.

The group's vice chairman, Charlie Bennett, said they spent much of the evening distributing sandbags to those affected to stop the flow of water. He said: ""A couple of the properties that we went into had all their carpets pulled up, carpets and furniture destroyed."" Mr Bennett added: ""The residents there said the water last entered their properties in 2008 and they've not seen flooding there since. ""So something has obviously changed, I don't think the volume of water at that point was as high as it had been in the past."" He also said his group would remain on standby throughout the week after The meteorological service said Storm Claudia was expected to ""bring heavy rain leading to flooding and disruption"". Mr Bennett said: ""Unfortunately, it's only a small token and we can only do what we can do with 40 or 50 sandbags but it will do something."" Michael Davies, a Tupsley resident, said he was left powerless to stop water trickling into his property. ""I came home from work, sat on the sofa as you do and then when we came to lock up there was water in our hallway,"" he said. ""I went to open the door and a person behind the door told me not to open it, they told me to go to the window and it was the fire service.

Southern Water said it was ""highly likely"" that millions of pellets over the weekend was due to an issue at its Eastbourne wastewater site. The water company, which has apologised for the spill, said a was spotted on 28 October, but it was not known at the time whether any pellets had escaped. A spokesperson said that about 80% of the beads have now been removed from the beach as a result of the clean-up operation, led by RDC. The water company said: ""We're continuing to monitor and clear the beach for any more beads. ""The beads are non-toxic, non-hazardous, and chemically stable - they pose no risk to water quality or public health. They cause no harm from contact but should not be swallowed."" Southern Water said it anticipated that ""more beads may wash up with the spring tide"". The environment portfolio holder at RDC said she feared long-term ramifications of the spill. ""I'm very concerned about the ongoing impact this pollution incident will have on our environment,"" said Councillor Kathryn Field. ""Unfortunately, we could see pellets washing up on our coastline at Camber and elsewhere for the next year or even longer."" Nurdle, the non-profit company enlisted by RDC to help remove the pellets, has told the council its specialist equipment is most effective following spring tides. As a result, work will continue after each spring tide over the coming weeks and months. RDC leader Doug Oliver said the council was in talks with Southern Water to have further specialist equipment delivered to Camber as soon as possible.

2025-11-13,How prepared is Scotland for severe weather over the winter?,science,BBC,"Scotland's transport networks are set to be tested in the coming weeks as winter brings an increased likelihood of extreme weather. Last year the country was battered by the winds of Storm Bert and Storm Darragh. And in January one driver was killed, buildings were damaged and thousands of homes were left without power as As operators outlined resilience plans for the season, the Met Office's John Harrison said: ""Being prepared for severe weather is the best way of minimising impacts."" BBC Scotland News takes a look at the measures in place to keep people safe. The roads network is often the focal point of weather-related disruption and, in recent times, people have become used to the Met Office's But the threat is not restricted to the winter, as illustrated by Statistics also back up the reality that severe weather is now an all-year-round problem. For example, over the last three years flooding has restricted the trunk network for an average of 62 days each year. This compares with an average of 20 days from 2015 to 2017. Scotland's annual winter service will see around 240 gritters undertake salt spreading and snow ploughing patrols of the trunk road network. The winter preparations include dedicated snow plans for key routes like the M8, M74, M77, M80 and the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. And around 497,000 tonnes of salt is already in stock - more than was used for the entirety of last winter. Martin Thomson, Transport Scotland's national operations manager for resilience, said modern technology was at the forefront of plans to manage severe weather. ""In addition to work on the Queensferry Crossing to mitigate ice, a new advanced weather forecasting system, new sensors to provide early warning of risk levels, and automatic barriers are now in play, if required. ""Effective communications with the public and stakeholders is also critical."" Chief Supt Scott McCarren, Police Scotland's head of road policing, said a multi-agency approach was necessary to ""prepare, respond and recover"" from severe weather. Officers are embedded with Transport Scotland and work alongside trunk road operating companies to gain an overview of traffic management. But Chief Supt McCarren also urged the public to play their part. He said: ""Everyone can help emergency services by planning ahead, check for road closures in advance, pay attention to weather warnings and listen to travel advice."" The challenges facing the rail network during extreme weather came into sharp focus last week when a The Avanti West Coast service came off the tracks on the West Coast Main Line at 06:10 on 3 November while travelling at 80mph. Of the 87 people on board, including staff, four were left with minor injuries but no-one required hospital treatment. Network Rail has invested heavily in safety measures since a Glasgow-bound train came off the rails at Carmont, Aberdeenshire, after it hit a landslide following heavy rain. Driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62, From 2024 to 2029, Network Rail plans to spend £1.9bn in infrastructure renewal, including £400m on weather resilience. These measures include wireless tilt meters - deployed at over 130 sites across Scotland - which detect slope movement and alert control teams. Network Rail has increased its use of helicopters for lineside inspections and aerial surveys in a bid to identify risks. Its specialist equipment includes snowploughs and a £1m Winter Train for defrosting infrastructure. The company has also allocated more than £100m - double its previous spend - to targeting issues such as hazardous trees and overhead line risks. Ross Moran, route director at Network Rail Scotland, said teams were ready to respond throughout the year to conditions including strong winds, flooding and ice. He said: ""Storms Amy and Floris showed how quickly conditions can change and how important it is to have boots on the ground and the right technology in place."" Recent storms have been responsible for widespread delays and cancellations across Calmac's ferry network. Finlay MacRae, head of operations, said: ""CalMac operates lifeline services within a complex marine landscape, which means that challenging weather conditions can affect our ability to operate effectively. ""Planning is key when it comes to severe weather, so we actively take part in resilience partnerships and planning events across our network with emergency services, local authorities, and other transport providers."" Mr MacRae said the company aimed to ""deliver clear messages as early as possible"" online or through frontline staff when significant weather events are forecast. Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop warned the had been dramatic in recent years. And she said it was vital for people to work together to keep the country moving. She added: ""Severe weather has traditionally been associated with winter, snow, ice and gritters. ""However, we just have to look back at the impact of Storm Amy and Storm Floris to realise that we can face challenging conditions at any time of year."" The minister said hard work was being done behind the scenes to mitigate problems before they arise, but she encouraged travellers to plan ahead when conditions take a turn. have all helped raise awareness of the issue. ""But the public also have a role to play - from drivers making sure their vehicles are winter ready to commuters on the rail and ferry networks checking with operators ahead of time to see how services are affected. ""Because of climate change, we are seeing more frequent heavy rain and more weather extremes throughout the year."" Earlier this week, Health Secretary Neil Gray announced almost 100 new ambulance staff had been recruited to help the NHS cope with the traditional surge in patients at this time of year. Last winter, the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) was placed on the highest level of emergency due to the ""significant pressure"" placed on services. Gray also confirmed that more than 250 newly-qualified paramedics were expected to be recruited this year. But Scottish Conservatives health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said the numbers were a ""drop in the ocean"". On Thursday, Gray told MSPs in Holyrood that he was determined to prevent pressure on the system ""as much as possible"" this winter. The health secretary announced £20m to boost social care capacity in an effort to reduce hospital admissions and ""ensure people receive the right care in the most appropriate setting"". He added: ""We have significantly increased Scottish Ambulance Service staffing and we are investing in capacity in our NHS 24 call centres so that people are getting the right support quickly and when they need it. ""Our dedicated health and social care staff are the cornerstone of our winter response every year - they will continue to work tirelessly in the coming months to provide excellent care, and I thank them for their outstanding efforts."" Waiting times came under the spotlight last week after it emerged a Queen's Park footballer with a dislocated knee waited nearly 10 hours for an ambulance. was hurt during the Glasgow club's 5-0 defeat to Partick Thistle on Saturday. But he was left waiting until about 01:00 on Sunday before an ambulance arrived at Firhill stadium. The health secretary later apologised to the player. Meanwhile, SAS chief executive Michael Dickson warned that there was already an increase in demands on the service compared to last year. He said: ""To help our staff over winter, we'd like to remind the public that if you need urgent care, but it's not life-threatening, you can call NHS 24 on 111, day or night, or visit your GP during opening hours."" First Minister John Swinney has already urged all those eligible for a flu vaccination this year to take up the offer. Last year, more than 6,500 adults were hospitalised with the virus, which increased strain on the NHS. Eligible groups include people 65 years and older, pregnant women and those with certain health conditions. Unpaid carers and health and social care staff are also eligible as the vaccine helps prevent transmission of the virus to those they are caring for. brought snow to Scotland's central belt leading to disruption to public transport and the cancellation of sporting fixtures.

2025-11-12,Study finds shouting may stop gulls stealing food,science,BBC,"Shouting at gulls makes them more likely to leave your food alone, research has revealed. University of Exeter researchers put a closed box of chips on the ground to attract herring gulls and watched the effect different recordings had on them. Once a gull approached, they played either a recording of a male voice shouting the words ""no, stay away, that's my food"", the same voice speaking those words or the birdsong of a robin. They tested a total of 61 gulls across nine seaside towns in Cornwall and found nearly half of those exposed to the shouting voice flew away within a minute. In contrast, 70% of gulls exposed to the robin song stayed near the food for the duration of the experiment. The team said they found 15% of the gulls exposed to the speaking male voice flew away, while the rest walked away from the food, still sensing danger. Dr Neeltje Boogert of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the Penryn campus said: ""So when trying to scare off a gull that's trying to steal your food, talking might stop them in their tracks but shouting is more effective at making them fly away."" The university said the experiment was designed to show that physical violence was not necessary to scare off gulls, and the researchers used male voices as most crimes against wildlife were carried out by men. ""Most gulls aren't bold enough to steal food from a person, I think they've become quite vilified,"" said Dr Boogert. ""What we don't want is people injuring them. They are a species of conservation concern, and this experiment shows there are peaceful ways to deter them that don't involve physical contact,"" added Dr Boogert. In 2020, a study by scientists at the University of Exeter found gulls were more likely to be In the study, scientists offered herring gulls a choice of two identical food items, from which 79% of the gulls opted for items they had seen in human hands. In 2019, researchers at the university also found the secret to protecting your seaside chips from The study revealed birds were more likely to steal food when they avoided the gaze of their victims.

2025-11-11,Water firm agrees £11m package to cut sewage spills,science,BBC,"A water company has agreed to fund £11m worth of improvements to cut sewage spills across its network to avoid a fine by the regulator. Wessex Water and its shareholders will pay for upgrades to reduce spills at storm overflow sites, extra monitoring equipment, and to help customers better manage rainwater at their properties. The company proposed the package to avoid a £10m penalty after an Ofwat investigation found it had failed to adequately maintain and upgrade its waste water network. Wessex Water and Ofwat said the deal would mean the money would be used for the benefit of its customers and the local environment, rather than going to HM Treasury. None of the sum will be paid by customers or added to bills, Ofwat said. will now be held on the agreement before Ofwat makes its final decision to give it the go-ahead. Lynn Parker, senior director for enforcement at Ofwat, said Wessex Water's lack of investment ""meant there were spills from storm overflows when there shouldn't have been"". She added: ""To their credit, the company has been one of the more proactive in investigating and rectifying the problems identified. ""However, there remain breaches which must be accounted for and corrected."" Clean water campaigner and wild swimmer Johnny Palmer was sceptical the deal would have much impact, describing it as ""a drop in the ocean"". ""It's not an investment, they are just being told to do the things that we pay them to do so I challenge the concept of investment entirely,"" he said. A spokesperson for Wessex Water said: ""We regret the impact our waste water performance has had on customers and the environment. ""When the issues at our treatment sites were identified we were quick to fix them, but we do agree that there is much more to do – particularly in areas where groundwater enters the sewerage network and can result in overflows operating long after rainfall events."" ""The proposals in this package will tackle the problem directly, sealing pipes on private land that we would not normally have powers over, as well as additional monitoring and initiatives like water butts and rain gardens to help customers treat rainwater as a valuable resource,"" they added. ""This not only prevents pollution but also reduces the risk of sewer flooding for communities."" The company said it was planning investment of £300m in its sewerage infrastructure by 2030, including expansion of key waste water treatment sites. It added that a key part of its strategy is to encourage sustainable rainwater management to prevent it overwhelming the sewage system during heavy rain. Water Minister Emma Hardy said: ""Water company failures like these are unacceptable - polluting the environment and impacting local communities, and it is only right that Wessex Water has accepted it needs to make amends. ""We are taking urgent action to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas, including stopping unfair bonuses and introducing prison sentences of up to two years for polluting water bosses.""

BBC journalists saw United Nations security staff running behind a line of Brazilian soldiers shouting at delegates to immediately leave the venue. The UN told BBC News that the incident caused minor injuries to two security staff, in addition to limited damage to the venue. Social media videos showed protesters that appeared to be from indigenous groups and others waving flags with the logo of a left-wing Brazilian youth movement called Juntos. Protesters, some wearing what appeared to be traditional indigenous dress, stormed the COP30 entrance, chanting and kicking down doors, before tussling with security personnel, videos posted online showed. Demonstrators crossed the first security barriers of the venue and were then prevented from getting further in, the UN told the BBC. A security guard said he was hit in the head by a drum thrown by a protester, according to the Reuters news agency. It is a highly unusual security breach at a conference that has strict protocols. Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident, according to the UN. Delegates from almost 200 countries are attending COP30 talks, which officially runs from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. This year's gathering takes place ten years after the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. It is the first time the conference is being held in Brazil, with the talks taking place in Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. The location has proved a controversial decision for a number of reasons, in part due to the Amazon's residents, many of whom are vocal critics of the environmental damage caused to their home by climate change and deforestation. which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. An indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community told Reuters, ""we can't eat money,"" and that they were upset about development in the rainforest. ""We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers,"" he said. The meetings this year have been dubbed ""the Indigenous peoples COP"", with Brazilian organisers promising to put indigenous people at the centre of the talks. Brazil's Minister of Indigenous Peoples Sonia Guajajara hailed COP30 as ""historic"" event, and estimated that 3,000 Indigenous peoples from around the world would be in attendance. A UN report released earlier this year said that Indigenous people safeguard 80% of the planet's remaining biodiversity – yet receive less than one per cent of international climate funding. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to their dependence on the natural environment and its resources. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva He said that the decision to hold COP30 in Belém was designed to show that the Amazon is an essential part of the climate solution, adding that ""COP30 will be the COP of truth"" in an era of ""misrepresentation"" and ""rejection of scientific evidence"".

Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir said ""everyone has a role to play"" in tackling the ""persistent problem"" of litter. A total of 17,575 items of litter were recorded across the 12 beaches surveyed in Northern Ireland in 2024. A significant amount of drink-related litter also made the ""terrible 10"" list of the most observed items. Plastic and polystyrene fragments sized under 2.5cm topped the list, followed by tangled fishing nets, rope, string, and cord with a diameter of less than 1cm. Under Northern Ireland's Environmental Improvement Plan, an Extended Producer Responsibility scheme will be phased in from 2025, as part of UK-wide plans to tackle waste from packaging. A Deposit Return Scheme, returning a small deposit on single use drinks containers to consumers, The Marine Litter Report has been carried out annually since 2012, using the It brings together 15 governments and the European Union to protect the North East Atlantic marine environment. More than 70 beaches are monitored in each of the four seasons, during defined survey periods. In Northern Ireland, samples are taken from 12 beaches. Each beach is cleaned within two weeks of the survey to ensure the amount of marine litter is not being duplicated. The results from each survey are added to a central database.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93d290j808o
2025-11-12,Council sees 'depressing' overspend on recycling,science,BBC,"A council has been left with a ""deeply depressing"" overspend on waste recycling. Unlike black bin rubbish, which local authorities have to pay to dispose of, materials from kerbside recycling collections and household waste recycling centres can be sold as a source of income. But North Somerset Council said this year, reduced prices and increased costs have hugely impacted this income stream. Mickey Green, the council's director of environment, assets, and travel, said: ""We are collecting more recycling but due to global […] pressures, it's all worth less."" Mr Green said that recycling still generates millions to offset waste services at the council, although less than last year. The price of plastic in particular has dropped by half since last year, according to the A tonne of plastic that would have sold for £168 in 2024/25 is now only fetching £80.  As a result, the council earned £260,000 less this year. To help with recycling costs, a government spokesperson said £69bn had been available this year for councils to deliver public services, including a 6.4% increase in funding for North Somerset Council compared to 2024. Despite this additional government support, more than 20 plastics facilities have shut down in the country in the past two years. A report which went before the meeting of the North Somerset Council corporate, assets, transport, and environmental services scrutiny committee (CATE) said the market was starting to improve, but it could take more than a year. The council is estimated to lose out on another £100,000 because the off-takers used to dispose of wood have relocated from Newport to Barry in Wales. Steve Bridger, chair of the CATE committee, said it was ""deeply depressing"" that the money lost due to market fluctuations was more than the council was set to save from its planned cuts to library services, which are ""highly likely"" to close three local libraries. North Somerset Council is currently facing a £25m black hole in its budget for the next financial year, largely driven by a rapidly increasing demand for and cost of social care. The council's top finance officers have warned that the council will not be able to balance its budget without ""exceptional financial support"" from the government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdegjl9p9pgo
2025-11-12,Escaped flamingo doing 'extremely well' in France,science,BBC,"A juvenile flamingo which escaped from a wildlife sanctuary more than a week ago is thought to be doing ""extremely well"" in the wild, keepers have said. in Hayle, Cornwall, despite her feathers being clipped on one wing to prevent her from reaching full flight. - where she is thought to have settled. David Woolcock, curator at the park, said staff were ""devastated"" when Frankie escaped but he felt relieved she had ""shown the resilience and skills"" to aid her as a wild flamingo. Mr Woolcock said there were ""numerous issues"" with the idea of bringing Frankie back to the park, including avian influenza. ""If she were to be caught in France she would then need to be housed at a French institution to be health screened as part of the UK importation process,"" he said. ""But it is unlikely that [anyone] would agree to hold Frankie as she has been mixing with wild birds and may have been in contact with avian influenza infected birds. ""Avian influenza continues to be a major threat to wild birds and we hope that Frankie remains safe and healthy."" Mr Woolcock said there had been reports of ""similar situations"" where flamingos had lived ""for many years and thrived"", including in winter. Frankie had her feathers clipped on one wing, a method used to prevent birds from reaching full flight, but Mr Woolcock said it usually inhibited the ability to take off, not necessarily the ability to fly once airborne. Keepers said Frankie, who hatched in July, had become independent of her parents and was showing signs of flapping her wings while at the park. Mr Woolcock said: ""We suspect that it was in just such an exercise period that Frankie was caught by a gust of wind which made her airborne. Mr Woolcock said flamingos were ""quite hardy creatures"" and were known to fly hundreds of miles to cross continents. He said the evidence park staff had seen of Frankie in France ""shows a well-adjusted, well-fed bird, doing extremely well"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpykye4qxo
2025-11-12,Trust recognised for work to save frog species,science,BBC,"A wildlife conservation trust has been shortlisted for an award for its work to save the agile frog. Jersey's Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust said conservation efforts to safeguard the species began in 2001 and it had been recognised at the Great British Wildlife Restoration Awards. The trust said Jersey was the only place in the British Isles with a population of agile frogs but they had steadily declined to two locations in the island by the 1980s and later in the decade there was just one breeding site due to a pesticide spill. Emma Michel, from the trust, said: ""Without this contribution, the species would have probably completely disappeared from Jersey by now."" The trust said the awards aimed to show the work taking place ""tackle the drastic decline of native species, whilst also urging politicians to act now for nature"". It said the agile frogs in Jersey were genetically different to other agile frogs due to their separation from the populations in mainland Europe. ""To date, Durrell has head-started over 75,000 tadpoles to metamorphosis and released them back into Ouaisne, Noirmont, and Beauport ponds,"" it said. ""Raising the tadpoles in a bio-secure converted shipping container at Jersey Zoo protects them during their most vulnerable stage, meaning more of the population survives once Durrell releases them into the wild."" The trust said there were 26 other shortlisted projects with a winner to be decided in January. Ms Michel said: ""As an organisation, Durrell puts a lot of work into the conservation of endangered species all around the world, but it is just as important to preserve the biodiversity on our doorstep. ""With a new species action plan agreed with our partners in 2024, we will keep developing the project to increase the population of this wonderful Jersey native frog.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk858kk5yo
2025-11-12,Why are landslides grinding routes to a halt?,science,BBC,"Huge landslides occur in their hundreds every year across the UK, with many causing significant damage and some resulting in fatalities. But what actually causes them and why are shutting down travel routes? Cumbria has experienced its fair share of landslides and experts are warning they could become more common. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the The British Geological Survey (BGS), which monitor landslides, define them as a mass movement of material, such as rock, earth or debris, down a slope. A landslide, or a landslip, can happen suddenly or more slowly over long periods of time. Dr Richard Johnson, an associate professor in geography at the University of Cumbria, said they were not a new phenomenon. ""Their history goes back millennia, if you were to look around the landscape there is clear evidence of historical failures,"" he said. Landslides occur when materials on a slope are weakened and gravity is forced to act. They fall, topple, slide or flow, and can be caused by multiple factors including: Dr Claire Dashwood, engineering geohazard geologist at BGS, said a database on UK landslides had about 19,000 records. The BGS does daily landslide hazard assessments so it can issue warnings. Dr Dashwood said the biggest trigger was rainfall. She said: ""In the summer months we don't get as many and then we tend to have peaks, a ramp up of landslides through October to March."" In Cumbria 41 landslides have been reported to the BGS in the past decade, with three this year. The largest recorded peak came in 2015 when , resulting in thousands of homes and businesses flooded and 341mm (13ins) of rain falling in just 24 hours in the county. ""Cumbria is on the coast, attracts a lot of rainfall and has steep slopes,"" Dr Dashwood said. Most recently an Avanti West Coast service from Glasgow Central to London Euston derailed after it came off the tracks at Shap on 3 November. Network Rail confirmed a landslip had occurred in the area before the train derailed. Of the 87 people on board, four suffered minor injuries. Network Rail said the line reopened the next day and it was taking action to ""improve the resilience"" of the route including earthworks to stabilise embankments. It said it was working with the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) to try and piece together what had happened. A rail firm spokesperson said: ""This incident happened on a relatively inaccessible part of the West Coast Main Line in very poor weather conditions. ""While this area of the railway was being maintained in line with industry standards, our investigation into the cause of the derailment is still ongoing but our initial focus was getting passengers safely back on the move."" Two days later, the region also witnessed another on the A592. The road had to be shut at Kirkstone Pass, between Troutbeck and Kirkstone Inn, due to a landslide. Westmorland and Furness Council released pictures of the aftermath on the road which it said Dr Dashwood said incidents like Kirkstone Pass can be more difficult to deal with if  earth and debris is lost below the road because the carriageway may have to be rebuilt. She said Cumbria was a ""big mix of small landslides which are quite impactful on roads and railways, and the coast"". While the region does not have the worst landslides in the UK, the BGS said many landslips had occurred historically in the Lake District, making it vulnerable. Dr Dashwood said the previous sites in the landscape can be ""reactivated by rainfall or loss of materials"". Richard Smith, from the Lakes Line Rail User Group, previously told Radio Cumbria that landslips were a ""Europe-wide problem"". He said: ""Victorian embankments along the railways are beginning to show their age. ""There is a need all over the country, and in other countries like us suffering from the effects of climate change, to strengthen structures that have been in use for a long time."" Ten years ago, Prof Robert Duck said ""problems had been stored up"" because Victorian railway companies built by the coast on flat, cheap land. and the coasts ""did not come into anyone's minds at all"". Network Rail said it was using monitoring technology, including track sensors, CCTV and remote condition systems to help detect movement and respond quickly when ground conditions changed. Prof Johnson said the best advice was to make people aware of landslides before they occurred. He said if anyone ends up near one, with material coming towards them, they should ""get out of the way quickly, 90 degrees away"" from the direction it is going. ""If you see it coming towards you, run lateral to it because these things can move at speeds faster than we can run,"" Prof Johnson said. Prof Johnson said they cannot be prevented but their triggers can be controlled. Not overloading soil, balancing vegetation and drainage can all help, he said. ""However, if those soils are already saturated from heavy rainfall, drainage can only do so much,"" he added. He said there was a ""real need"" not to debate on whether climate change exists but to look at solutions to modify behaviours to reduce its impact. ""Climate change is here, it is now, it is happening, so lets deal with that reality.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp8wemprgo

2025-11-11,Wylfa nuclear plans expected to get go-ahead in days,science,BBC,"Wylfa on Anglesey is expected to be the site for a new nuclear power station, with the decision to be confirmed on Thursday, BBC Wales has been told. It is thought that the UK government will give the go-ahead for a small modular reactor (SMR). Ministers have been weighing up whether to choose Anglesey or Oldbury, in Gloucestershire, after signing a £2.5bn partnership with Rolls Royce to build it earlier this year. It is hoped the plant will provide up to 900 full-time jobs and several thousand more during construction. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has been asked to comment. It is not known how many small reactors will be built at Wylfa, but the site is believed to be capable of accommodating more than one. Previously, the UK government department has promised a ""golden age of nuclear"" which would ""protect family finances, boost energy security and create thousands of jobs"". are manufactured in a factory in modules before being assembled on-site and can power around a million homes. , for Wylfa to house a larger gigawatt nuclear power plant, which could power three million homes. Wylfa is an old nuclear power station off the coast of Anglesey, in north west Wales. It was built in the 1960s and first began generating electricity in 1971, employing thousands of workers. In 2015, Wylfa's last reactor was closed down and it began the long process of being decommissioned, ending 44 years of operations at the site. Most nuclear power plants have operating lifespans of 30-40 years, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. When Wylfa closed, it was Britain's oldest. It was owned and operated by Magnox, which had stopped producing the fuel required to run the plant in 2008, according to the UK government. Wylfa's first reactor shut down in 2012 before the site closed completely in 2015. The Welsh government refused to comment but referred to a previous statement issued on Monday, which said: ""Nuclear energy is part of our plan to move away from fossil fuels, using both large-scale and small modular reactors."" The statement continued: ""Wylfa is particularly well placed to attract investment in new nuclear plants because of its nuclear legacy and highly skilled local workforce. ""We continue to work with the UK government to ensure Wales' potential in this sector is fully realised."" Janet Finch-Saunders, Welsh Conservative shadow environment secretary, said the decision was a ""fantastic opportunity for Anglesey"", and added that it came following the ""tireless efforts"" of former Ynys Mon MP Virginia Crosbie and the previous UK Conservative government. Llinos Medi, the Plaid Cymru MP who took Crosbie's seat in last year's general election, said her constituents will ""rightly treat this story with caution until we see concrete action"". She said: ""We await further details to see how this announcement will secure high-quality, long-term jobs, and ensure local supply chains benefit from any development."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru leader, said the potential announcement would be a ""significant development"" but added it is ""just the start of the process"". Resident Clay Theakston said: ""I think it's a fantastic thing, I think the island has been crying out for jobs and extra work for quite a long time."" Rhian Synnot, who runs the Cain shop in Llangefni, said: ""I think it's a good thing, it will bring work for the young people on the island, so long as work goes to local people. ""Most of the factories have closed, so we need jobs here."" Gordon Gibson, 60, who lives in Llangefni, said: ""I'm all for it and it's more reliable and cleaner than a lot of the other power stations, and it doesn't take over land like the solar panels will."" Wylfa had been touted as being ""top of the list"" of sites being put forward by Rolls Royce to host the first of its SMRs. At the COP26 climate summit four years ago, the man in charge of the company's plans at the time Tom Samson told BBC Wales it was ""the ideal location to host a large number"" of them. The site's size and ""readiness"" - as well as a ""hugely supportive, strong and welcoming community"" were a big attraction, Mr Samson said. The decision - if confirmed on Thursday - will be warmly welcomed by the nuclear industry, though there are some who say privately they would have preferred to see the go-ahead for a more traditional large-scale plant. Opponents point to the fact that a long-term storage facility for the UK's nuclear waste is yet to be agreed upon and say investment in renewable energy schemes - wind, wave and tidal - is what Anglesey needs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdegjd16lrlo
2025-11-10,"Fight fake news and defeat climate deniers, Brazil's Lula tells UN talks",science,BBC,"The world must ""defeat"" climate denialism and fight fake news, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the opening meeting of the UN climate talks. In a rallying cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change ""a con job"" in September. The two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials. On Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside. Members of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats. Addressing the conference, President Lula said ""COP30 will be the COP of truth"" in an era of ""fake news and misrepresentation"" and ""rejection of scientific evidence"". Without naming President Trump, President Lula continued, ""they control the algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear"". ""It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,"" he said. Since President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US. His administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration. That puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy. This backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy. Some delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled ""bully-boy tactics"" by some participants. Addressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases. But then he took aim at ""squabbling"" between countries. ""Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,"" he said. Brazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years. That includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature. President Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally. Fund-raising got off to a slow start. Last week UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, at the last minute, that the UK would not contribute public money. But on Monday, UK climate envoy Rachel Kyte told BBC News that the fund was a ""brilliant idea"" and that the UK ""will make the investment at some point"". After a fight, nations finally agreed a conference agenda on Monday. It promises to consider the question of whether countries can still work towards keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Groups on the frontline of climate change, including coalition called Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) that mostly represents Caribbean and Pacific countries, had insisted the talks address the long-held goal. In recent weeks even the UN has said it accepts that overshooting this temperature is ""inevitable"". Last week UN General Secretary General António Guterres told leaders in Belém that the failure to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C was a ""moral failure and deadly negligence"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51pn74l23o

Barn owls typically live for about five years in the wild, with the oldest recorded wild owl living to 15 years old. The oldest known barn owl in captivity lived until the age of 21. Pepsi was often spotted on the arm of volunteer handler Martin around the Curraghs Wildlife Park in Ballaugh, and was considered a favourite for visitors. Park manager Kathleen Graham said it was ""sad to say goodbye"" but good to know that he had ""lived really beyond [his] years"". Ms Graham described Pepsi as a ""favourite character"" who was ""such a pretty owl, and a laid back owl"", and an ""ambassador for the species"". Often seen being walked around the park with Martin, people were able to engage with Pepsi and learn about the species. Ms Graham said such engagement meant people could ""see up close and learn first hand"" about owls, which also helped people connect to animals in the wild. Two new barn owls are now in the aviary, recently arrived from Five Sisters Zoo in Scotland - called Alba and Bee. Ms Graham explained that while barn owls are not considered endangered in the British Isles, they are on the ""red list"" on the Isle of Man, with only 10 known breeding pairs in the wild. The park was therefore working with the Manx Wildlife Trust to provide nesting boxes for people - especially those with land - to pick up, she said, to keep the species going. Having barn owls in an area also helped with rodent control, she added.

Ten general waste bins were randomly selected from across the town and sifted through by council waste warden, Chris Smith, who was able to fill over a dozen recycling bins and bags reducing the general waste bins from 10 to three. Mr Smith said ""education and engagement"" is needed to help people use the services provided but that he finds it ""egregious that someone would put [for example] glass in the general waste"". He added: ""It's very disappointing when you put a lot of effort into something and people don't play ball."" Statistics from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, (Defra), for 2023/24 showed Swindon Borough Council's recycling rates as 33.8%. Councillor Chris Watts said the council has improved this rate to 40% with the goal of reaching 50%, something he said is achievable. The importance of recycling is not solely about saving taxpayer money, accourding to Mr Watts, it is also about creating much needed funds for the council by selling bundled recyclables and food waste to companies. Adding this capacity has been improved by the introduction of a £1m recycling sorting machine which has reduced the council's rejection rate to ""below 1%"" which he said is ""a phenomenal figure"" and places as one the ""best rates in the country"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp0n08dd6o
2025-11-10,Scotland's first wind farm 'supercharged' after upgrade,science,BBC,"Scotland's first commercial wind farm will be able to deliver five times more clean power than before after being upgraded. The ScottishPower Renewables site at Hagshaw Hill - near the village of Douglas in South Lanarkshire - and replaced them with 14 larger installations. ScottishPower said the new turbines could now generate enough energy to  power the equivalent of 57,000 homes. Every blade from the original turbines will be recycled by manufacturing company Plaswire into new materials for construction, replacing concrete, timber and plastics. ScottishPower Renewables CEO Charlie Jordan said repowering sites like Hagshaw Hill will be the the fastest and most efficient way to boost renewable capacity and hit More than 79MW of clean electricity can be generated by the new turbines. Mr Jordan said:  ""Hagshaw Hill started Scotland's wind revolution – and now it's back online, supercharged and ready to lead the next chapter. ""We're proud of what this site represents: powering homes, powering communities and powering Scotland's clean energy future."" More than 100 jobs have been supported during the decommissioning and repowering of Hagshaw Hill. Andrew Billingsley, the CEO of Plaswire, added:  ""Plaswire's recycling process diverts waste from incineration, reducing CO2 emissions and replacing high carbon construction products."" A community benefit fund run by SPR is also increasing, with nearly £400,000 to be delivered annually to Coalburn, Douglas, Lesmahagow and Rigside & Douglas Water. The firm said that marked an increase of around 26 times more than previous funding, and would go towards improving local facilities and creating employment in the region.

2025-11-11,Carnivorous 'death-ball' among odd deep-sea finds,science,BBC,"A carnivorous ""death-ball"" sponge has been declared one of the oddest finds made during a deep-sea expedition near Antarctica. The unusual creature was discovered 2.2 miles (3.5km) deep in a trench north of Montagu Island in the Southern Ocean. It uses small hooks to catch and absorb its prey from the seabed and has strange appendages that end in orbs. Dr Michelle Taylor, a University of Essex scientist who led the voyage, said: ""If anything brushes up against them, they're doomed, unfortunately. Then to be absorbed slowly over time is a grim way of going."" Prey typically snagged by the deadly hooks include small crustaceans such as skeleton shrimp. The Velcro-like attack mechanisms have made the carnivorous creature uniquely ruthless compared with the passive, filter-feeding behaviour of most sponges. ""What makes these sponges so different is they don't eat these inert particles and tiny chunks of other things that are dead, they're actually carnivorous, so they eat much higher up the food chain,"" Dr Taylor told the BBC. The discovery was made on research cruises near the South Sandwich Islands by The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census and verified in August. Dr Taylor said the species, which is part of the genus , was illuminated at the front and had ""a series of white stalks with white ping pong balls"" on the end. She added: ""It's got this really unusual shape and it casts an incredible shadow into the background. ""It's a weird-looking animal, very strange indeed."" The death-ball name was coined by a sponge expert onboard the research ship, who felt it was apt given the creature's quirky danger. Other new finds - of which there were 30 - included armoured and iridescent worms and a previously unknown species of sea stars. They were made on one of two research cruises with Schmidt Ocean Institute in 2025 to find new marine life. Almost 2,000 specimens were collected during these trips in some of the most remote parts of the planet. The researchers made international headlines in April when they for the first time in 100 years. The region they were operating in was so secluded that the nearest humans were hundreds of miles away on the International Space Station. Dr Taylor said the Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean, ""remains profoundly under-sampled"". She continued: ""To date, we have only assessed under 30% of the samples collected from this expedition. ""So confirming 30 new species already shows how much biodiversity is still undocumented.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4p7n2dkko
2025-11-10,Gold jar from Galloway Hoard on display for first time,science,BBC,"A gold and crystal jar found in Galloway by a metal detectorist in 2014, is on display to the public for the first time. The 5cm (2in) high jar is part of the Galloway Hoard - a collection described as one of the Decorated with a gold filigree - an intricate metalwork - experts say it resembles a perfume bottle. And a Latin inscription which translates as ""Bishop Hyguald had me made"" shows the vase likely had a religious function. When the jar was found it was wrapped in lengths of linen and placed in a silk-lined purse. Experts initially used 3D x-ray imaging to view the jar inside its wrapping without risking damaging the treasure. The jar was then separated from its wrapping with painstaking care over a series of months. Due to these textile preservation methods, this is the first time the object has been available for public viewing. Dr Martin Goldberg from National Museums Scotland said: ""The rock crystal jar is one of the highlight objects from the Galloway Hoard. ""The jar was the subject of international attention when we first revealed the inscription, and it's great to be able to put it on display for the first time in Kirkcudbright."" Due to gaps in 9th Century church records, it has not been possible to precisely identify Hyguald, but he was most likely a Northumbrian bishop. The inscription shows the clearest evidence that the hoard comes from a church or religious community in the early medieval kingdom of Northumbria. This included Dumfries and Galloway, and stretched all the way from Edinburgh to Sheffield. The research on the hoard was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, who gave £1m for the three-year project. It will be on display at Kirkcudbright Galleries until 14 June 2026.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0rrv524zo

It has come from former University of Warwick student Tim Hartnoll and will be used to establish a new research centre focusing on new types of batteries. Prof Stuart Croft, vice-chancellor and president at Warwick, said: ""This extraordinary act of generosity represents a defining moment for Warwick and for the future of sustainable energy."" He said the Hartnoll Centre for Experimental Fuel Technologies would bring leading experts together to develop a cleaner, more resilient future. , was this year presented with the University's Benefactor's Medal, in recognition of his support. Over the years, he has funded postdoctoral positions and scholarships at the university - including 13 research positions and 12 PhDs in Warwick's Astronomy and Astrophysics Group in the Department of Physics. He said: ""Since 1976, Warwick has played an important role in my life, shaping how I think and how I approach the world. ""I've always believed universities like Warwick are at their best when they bring people together to solve global challenges, and supporting research that drives innovation in sustainable energy feels both urgent and necessary.""

2025-11-09,Further rural spots gain 'dark sky friendly' status,science,BBC,"Three further rural communities in North Yorkshire are seeing stars after gaining dark sky recognition. Husthwaite in the Howardian Hills, and Lastingham and Sleightholme Dale in the North York Moors are the latest areas to be recognised for their efforts to reduce light pollution. To gain Dark Skies Friendly Community status, residents undertake a lighting audit, either replacing or altering fixtures to ensure at least 60% of all lighting meets the scheme's standard. The trio join Ampleforth Abbey and the villages of Coxwold and Hawnby in the North York Moors, and Bulmer, Crayke and Terrington in the Howardian Hills. ""Light pollution across the region has meant that many people can't see stars, they don't have as much nocturnal wildlife,"" said Richard Darn, from the Howardian Hills National Landscape. ""We want to try and help begin the process of reversing that."" The project is part of the Dark Skies Friendly scheme, which was launched by the North York Moors National Park in 2019. In addition to a lighting audit, the area must hold at least two outreach events a year such as stargazing sessions or educational talks. Discussing the village's new status, Nadine Cooper, chair of Lastingham Village Hall, said: ""I think Lastingham is a pretty dark village anyway, we don't have streetlights and I think we understand the benefits. ""We often see the stars and the Northern Lights so this has just enhanced it."" Her husband John Cooper is treasurer of Sustainable Lastingham, a group set up to explore ways of reducing the community's carbon footprint. ""If we don't all look to improve lighting, over time the area will get lighter and lighter - it's a project for the whole area really,"" he said. The village hall's exterior lights were changed for warmer LED lighting, angled downwards rather than projected out. ""It's clearly darker around the hall and the lighting isn't shining up into the sky any more,"" Mr Cooper said. In Husthwaite, its village hall was also the focus of light reduction measures, with  timed security lighting installed instead of permanent lights. The village voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of joining the scheme, according to Sheila Mowatt, co-chair of the Husthwaite Village Hall committee. ""I think it just sparked real enthusiasm and passion from the village,"" she said. About 2,500 people will soon be part of Dark Skies Friendly Communities, according to the scheme. More locations are soon expected to become accredited, including Bransdale and the villages of Goathland and Botton. Mr Darn said he would love to see even larger communities explore ways they could reduce light pollution. ""The message is equally as applicable to towns and cities around the country who need better lighting than they've got at the moment,"" he said. ""I think what we're doing here will be a model for other areas to follow.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zj4x3y1vo

David Hale, from Saltash, Cornwall, has been working with local residents to clear debris, repair homes, and deliver food and essential supplies and raise money through an online fundraiser. Mr Hale said the area he was living in had less damage than what he expected, but other areas were in need of support. He said: ""Trees were just down everywhere, power lines down everywhere, houses just flattened... like nothing you could even imagine."" He said: ""A couple of the guys in work were in the areas that had been worst affected and you just weren't able to communicate with them. ""We then made the decision that we needed to go in support and help these people because, as much as the government is here is doing everything they can, there's just not enough people here to help through our work."" He added people were desperate for both food and water, but people also needed help because they had no roof. He said they put tarpaulins up to keep them sheltered. He said: ""The plan is to go back up and do some more work and again expand the aid relief within the area because people are walking from other towns to come and see you, to come and beg you to help them.""

2025-11-08,Methane-cutting cow feed trials brought to an end,science,BBC,"A major UK trial of a controversial feed additive designed to reduce emissions of planet-warming methane gas by dairy cows has ended. Arla Foods, owner of the UK's largest dairy co-operative, is now reviewing the results of the tests on 30 farms before any decision on future use is made. The launch of the Bovaer supplement trial last year saw concerns raised over food safety, as well as misinformation and conspiracy theories posted online, with Bovaer is now the focus of an investigation in Denmark after farmers raised fresh concerns but manufacturer DSM-Firmenich said the additive was ""proven, effective and safe"". The company spokesman added that it had been ""successfully used for over three years by thousands of farmers in over 25 countries."" But he said: ""We are aware that in recent days, some farmers have raised concerns about cow health. ""We are actively engaging with the relevant organizations to ensure that all these concerns are fully investigated and properly addressed. ""In previously reported cases, Bovaer was not identified as a contributing factor to the health concerns raised."" Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and, although it does not hang around in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, it is 28 times stronger over a 100-year period. It is claimed Bovaer - a brand name for the additive 3-Nitrooxypropanol - could reduce cow methane emissions by between 30-45%, and help farmers be more environmentally-friendly. It works by suppressing the enzymes in a cow's stomach that create the gas. The supplement, which is added in small quantities to cow feed, has been approved for use by UK regulators and concluded there were no safety concerns when Bovaer is used at the approved dose. But it is not clear whether the additive will be more widely used in the UK, with a spokeswoman for Arla saying the findings of its trial were ""currently being reviewed"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said ""animal welfare must continue to be our highest priority"" with any new product. Paul Tompkins, who oversees the NFU Dairy Board, said: ""Following reports of investigations in Denmark into the use of methane suppresants, we will continue to monitor the situation for any developments to ensure the impact of any product is known."" as part of the government's plan to reduce the environmental impact from agriculture. About 1,400 out of 2,000 dairy farms in Denmark are currently using Bovaer. Jannik Elmegaard, of the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration, told the BBC they were ""very aware that some herd owners have reported animals showing signs of illness after being fed with Bovaer"" but it was ""unclear how many cows were affected"". He added that they were ""closely monitoring"" the situation and collecting data so that they could determine the cause of the illnesses but emphasised that Bovaer had ""undergone a long and thorough approval process"". as part of its research into reducing methane emissions from cows and gives advice to the Danish authorities. Professor Charlotte Lauridsen, from the university's Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, said of the concerns raised: ""The pattern of disease now being described in the media – with fever, diarrhoea and, in some cases, dead cows – has never been observed in our extensive studies."" But she added that the reports were being taken seriously and researchers were now collecting samples from herds where problems had been reported. A spokesperson for Bovaer manufacturer DSM-firmenich said the company was ""aware that in recent days, some farmers have raised concerns about cow health"". ""We are actively engaging with the relevant organisations to ensure that all these concerns are fully investigated and properly addressed,"" he explained.

2025-11-09,Rare orchid brought back from brink of extinction,science,BBC,"A rare wild orchid has been brought back from the brink of extinction by the work of dedicated conservationists. The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland's vascular plant red list has revealed that the Fen Orchid Liparis loeselii is officially no longer considered under threat in Britain. Cambridge University Botanic Garden has been working with Plantlife and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to reintroduce and increase the number of Fen Orchids since 2008. Tim Pankhurst, former conservation manager at Plantlife, said: ""Playing a leading role in reducing the threat status of such a beautiful yet mercurial orchid is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a botanist and one I will always treasure."" The Fen Orchid typically grows among reeds nestled in moss that retains moisture and relies on the presence of specific moss and fungi to grow. The primary cause of the plants decline has been habitat loss through drainage and abandonment of the fens. In 2010, the plant was only found at three sites in East Anglia and at one site in Wales. Now it has been recorded at seven sites in England and three in Wales - with its population in the UK exceeding 10,000 individual plants. Mr Pankhurst, who has dedicated his life's work to protecting the species before his retirement in April, says the most important aspect of the conservation project has been collaboration. ""As we face the enormous challenges of climate and biodiversity loss, this provides a moment of genuine hope for the future and is a testament to what dedicated partnership conservation work delivered consistently over many decades can deliver,"" he said. ""You don't achieve successes like this on your own."" According to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, this is the first time the Fen Orchid has successfully been cultivated in Great Britain. Peter Stroh, scientific officer at the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, said the revision of the species threat status was ""excellent news"". He said: ""It's important to remember that the Fen Orchid remains a conservation-dependent species. ""The challenge now is to ensure that the Fen Orchid continues to thrive in its current locations and, either naturally or with a helping hand, flourish in former sites and new places within its native range in the coming years.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp21j5n25o
2025-11-10,Dundee and US surgeons achieve world-first stroke surgery using robot,science,BBC,"Doctors from Scotland and the US have completed what is thought to be a world-first stroke procedure using a robot. Prof Iris Grunwald, of the University of Dundee, performed the remote thrombectomy - the removal of blood clots after a stroke - on a human cadaver that had been donated to medical science. The professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, while the body she was operating on while using the machine was at a university facility. Hours later, Ricardo Hanel - a neurosurgeon in Florida - used the technology to carry out the first transatlantic surgery from his Jacksonville base on a human body in Dundee over 4,000 miles (6,400km) away. The team has called it a potential ""game changer"" if it becomes approved for use on patients. The medics believe this technology could transform stroke care, as a delay in accessing specialist treatment can have a direct impact on the chances of recovery. Prof Grunwald said: ""It felt as if we were witnessing the first glimpse of the future. ""Where previously this was thought to be science fiction, we demonstrated that every step of the procedure can already be done."" The University of Dundee is the global training centre of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, and is the only place in the UK where doctors can operate on cadavers with liquid which mimics human blood circulated in the vessels. ""This was the first time that we could perform the whole mechanical thrombectomy procedure in a real human body to show that all steps of the procedure are possible,"" said Prof Grunwald. Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association charity, told BBC News the transatlantic procedure was ""a remarkable innovation"". She added: ""For too long, people living in remote and rural areas have been deprived of access to thrombectomy. ""Robotics like this could rebalance the inequity which exists in stroke treatment across the UK."" In the experiment, fluid which mimics human blood was used in four different cadavers. The subjects, who donated their bodies to science, died within the past three years and were then embalmed. Both the Dundee and Florida procedures were carried out last month using robotics from the Lithuanian firm Sentante. While there have been remote thrombectomies carried out before on a , this is thought to have been the first procedure on a human body. The team now hope to take part in clinical trials next year. This cuts off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and brain cells lose function and die. The best treatment is a thrombectomy, where a specialist uses catheters and wires to remove the clot. But what happens when a patient can't get to a specialist who can do the procedure? Prof Grunwald said the experiment demonstrated a robot could be connected to the same catheters and wires a surgeon would normally use, and a medic who is with the patient could simply attach the wires. The surgeon, in another location, could then hold and move their own wires, and the robot then carries out exactly the same movements in real time on the patient to carry out the thrombectomy. The patient would be in a hospital operating room, while the doctor could carry out the procedure using the Sentante machine from anywhere - even their own home. Prof Grunwald and Ricardo Hanel could see live X-rays of the body in the experiments, and monitor progress in real time, with the Dundee expert saying it took only took 20 minutes of training. Tech giants Nvidia and Ericsson were involved in the project to ensure the connectivity of the robot. Dr Hanel said: ""To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond lag - a blink of an eye - is truly remarkable."" Prof Grunwald, who has won an award from Innovate UK for her work and is also the vice president of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, said there were two main problems with a standard thrombectomy - a global shortage of doctors who can do it, and treatment depends on your location. In Scotland, there are only three places patients can receive the procedure - Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh. If you don't live there, you must travel. Prof Grunwald said: ""The treatment is very time sensitive. ""Every six minutes delay, you have a 1% less chance of having a good outcome. ""This technology would now provide a new way where you're not depending on where you live - saving the valuable minutes where your brain is otherwise dying."" there were 9,625 ischaemic strokes in Scotland last year. Only 212 - or 2.2% of all patients - received a thrombectomy, while 1,045 people received medication to burst the clots. received a thrombectomy in the year to March 2024. ""It feels amazing,"" added Edvardas Satkauskas, the CEO of Sentante, speaking to BBC News from the company's base in Lithuania. ""Sometimes, the future is way closer than we think.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw983pvz6lo

Mat and Lloyd's tenanted 198-hectare arable farm near Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, is home to several species of birds needing action and a growing variety of bees, butterflies and insects. Their farming methods have seen them adopting strip tillage, inter-row hoeing and cutting nitrogen use by a third. Their wildlife habitats have also been enhanced through wildflower corners and pollinator zones, alongside their bird seed business. The farm has been regularly opened for community initiatives, including the Launched in 2022, the SFI formed part of the payments that replaced EU subsidies after Brexit.

2025-11-10,Amazon tree-felling blamed for polluting UK rivers,science,BBC,"Tree-felling in the Amazon rainforest is partly to blame for pollution that is plaguing UK rivers such as the Wye, a new report suggests. It points the finger of blame at soy which is imported from vast plantations overseas and used as livestock feed, calling this a ""hidden link"" to the poor state of many waterways in Wales, and around the UK. The report from environment groups says the soy is high in phosphorus, and becomes a pollutant when animal manure spread on land runs off into rivers. It calls for action to stop the import of commodities linked to deforestation, while the Welsh government said it was already taking ""ambitious steps"". ""What we eat and produce here... can have a profound effect on the future of forests and those communities that depend on them,"" explained Barbara Davies-Quy, deputy director of Size of Wales. ""Every time we buy cheap chicken fed on soy or buy corned beef from South American countries linked to deforestation risk, Wales is contributing to a system that drives the destruction of the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest and harms indigenous peoples."" The report has been released as representatives from 190 countries are gathering in the Brazilian city of Belém - described as a ""gateway to the Amazon"" - for Rainforests such as the Amazon are vital in the fight against rising global temperatures, acting as carbon sinks as well as being irreplaceable hotspots for biodiversity. World leaders pledged to halt and reverse deforestation at Glasgow's COP26 summit four years ago. But today's report says rainforest destruction continues at ""an alarming pace"", pointing to suggesting 6.7 million hectares of tropical forest were lost in 2024. Shea Buckland Jones of WWF Cymru said ""Wales' reliance on imported soy"" had left ""a trail of destruction from the forests of Brazil to the rivers of Wales"". The report calls for governments and local councils to do more to influence the situation by changing the food they buy in - avoiding goods which could have contributed to deforestation. It says every year Wales imports around 190,000 tonnes of soy and 12,000 tonnes of beef. Nearly three-quarters of the soy comes from countries that are at high risk of deforestation and social issues, as does 26% of beef imported. In western Paraná, Brazil, the Avá Guarani people have lost much of their ancestral lands to vast soy plantations. ""Agribusiness came and destroyed everything - our rivers, our forests, our food,""  said Karai Okaju, an Avá Guarani leader. ""The land is sick. It cannot breathe."" The community has established a link with Wales, alongside the Wampís nation from Peru, whose leaders recently visited the Senedd to meet with ministers. About 80% of soy brought into Wales is used as livestock feed for poultry and dairy farms. High in phosphorus, it can become a problem when excess nutrients from animal manure leaches into rivers and groundwater. The issue has been hugely controversial along the in recent years, with as many as 23 million chickens - a quarter of the UK's poultry production - raised in the river's catchment area. Several of Wales' other most protected river networks are also - including the Usk and Cleddau. The report calls on the Welsh government to support farmers through its new subsidy system - the - to reduce reliance on imported soy feed. It wants the public sector and businesses to commit to deforestation-free supply chains by 2028 and an outright ban on corned beef from Brazil. It calls too for the promotion of diets with ""less, but better"" meat and dairy. Despite what it describes as ""stark findings"", the report highlights positive examples of leadership on the issue in Wales. Caerphilly council has new mandatory deforestation-free criteria for food procurement. This means reducing the use of ultra-processed foods, sourcing higher welfare and organic meat and dairy, and Fairtrade coffee and cocoa. Monmouthshire council became Wales' first , in a move brought about as a result of It has involved scrutinising school meal provision across the county, reducing the use of palm oil and sourcing all beef from Wales. A ""deforestation-free chickpea korma"" has replaced chicken curry on school menus across the county. A delegation of school pupils from Monmouthshire have been invited to speak at an event at the COP30 summit via video link about what they have achieved. Leader of Monmouthshire council Mary Ann Brocklesby said it was now starting to look at meals offered in care homes and tourist sites. ""We want as many other councils across the UK to do the same - it makes sense for our future and it's even better when it's our young people who are holding us to account."" Wales' Future Generations Commissioner Derek Walker has also called for a ""deforestation-free public sector"" by 2028. Asked if it was affordable for councils to move away from cheap imported food at a time of squeezed budgets he said ""the cost of not doing this is huge... to the climate emergency"". Mr Walker added it could also help the Welsh economy, saying: ""Hopefully we'll be buying more locally-produced products whilst also doing the right thing globally."" The Welsh government said it recognised the importance ""of playing our part in reducing deforestation-linked impacts, particularly through our supply chains and international partnerships"". ""However, it is a challenge that requires a whole Wales effort, and one that we must face together to protect our planet for future generations,"" a spokesperson added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40qk7v938o
2025-11-09,Camera being designed to search for alien life,science,BBC,"Scientists at Durham University are helping to develop a new type of camera intended to help search for life on distant planets. Researchers there are part of a UK team designing a high-resolution imaging camera to be used on Nasa's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission. HWO will be the first telescope specifically designed to find Earth-like planets and  examine them for signs of life. Prof Richard Massey of Durham University said the new technology would be the ""21st Century's Hubble Space Telescope"" and could help make a number of major discoveries. ""As well as looking for life, a telescope that amazing will watch collisions of asteroids in our solar system, stare into black holes, and solve the mystery of dark matter,"" he said. Nasa's HWO mission is expected to launch in the early 2040s. Rocky planets like Earth are difficult to study as they are positioned close to stars and cannot be viewed due to their brightness. The telescope will use an instrument called a coronagraph to block out the bright glare and allow rocky planets to be seen for the first time. It is hoped the camera will be able to measure a planet's mass and inspect its  atmosphere for chemical signs of life. The UK hardware team is led by University College London and includes scientists and engineers from the University of Portsmouth, RAL Space, the UK Astronomy Technology Centre and Durham University. It is one of two groups funded by the UK Space Agency to investigate the feasibility of a UK-led high-resolution imager. The other group is led by the University of Leicester.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9lz2yj8lo
2025-11-10,Local energy club aims to provide cheaper power,science,BBC,"A voluntary group is setting up an energy club using locally produced renewable energy to cut electricity bills. Power Hull aims to set up a network of buildings with rooftop solar panels and battery storage, which would distribute power throughout the community. The first installation, funded by a £20,000 grant, has just been unveiled at the Lonsdale Community Centre in west Hull. Kevin Paulson from the group said the system would save the centre around £3,000 a year ""and that money will go directly into serving the community, such as more items in the food bank"". Work has already started on identifying other buildings in the area that could house the panels and batteries. The group has received a £34,500 grant from Great British Energy towards setting up the scheme. They would form a mini network which the group calls PlanGeo, named after the local electricity substation. Mr Paulson explained that the ""energy club model provides a real advantage"" as the rate between people exporting power and importing power varies greatly. ""Currently, if you have solar panels on your roof and you export energy to the grid, you get quite a low export tariff,"" he said. ""Highest at about 15p per unit, but can be as low as 3p a unit."" He said that energy club members get paid a higher rate, ""16p,17p a kilowatt hour is common in other places"". The not-for-profit group have been in discussion with local social housing groups, that could see panels installed on homes across the area. Ellen Clarke said the idea was that ""energy generated will stay local"". ""One of the huge benefits is all the money stays local as well,"" she said. ""So it cuts out the profits to the energy company. The Lonsdale and the other energy generators will get more money for selling their energy to the system."" As well as the financial benefits, Lauren Duguid said the system could address the issue of fuel poverty in Hull. ""I think the latest data is one in five households in energy poverty,"" she said.

2025-11-08,Former doctor swaps A&E for bat hospital,science,BBC,"A former A&E doctor who has transformed her home into a bat hospital has said she wants to help change public perception of the mammals. Carolyn Hargreaves, who lives near Hambledon, Hampshire, now works to rehabilitate bats that can be returned to the wild and care for those that cannot. The UK is home to 18 bat species, 17 of which can be found in the south of England. Describing the winged animals as ""charismatic"", Ms Hargreaves said she wished others could see bats the way she does. Following years working in a hospital, Ms Hargreaves has since turned her attention to bats, animals she believes are ""bursting with personality"". After joining the Hampshire Bat Group, she began caring for poorly bats, often arriving at her door with wing damage after having been attacked by domestic cats. ""The aim of the game is to get absolutely as many of them back out into the wild,"" she said. ""But some can't, and some are amenable to being kept."" One of her longest residents is Sweetie, a noctule bat found on a pavement in Portsmouth seven years ago with a fractured pelvis, likely after being trodden on. She now lives permanently at the hospital and has become an ambassador for her species, visiting schools and community groups. Sweetie's favourite place to be is tucked away inside Ms Hargreaves coat. Many bats face threats from habitat loss and modern building developments, which see roosting sites in old ancient trees or roofs disappear. Ms Hargreaves works alongside physicist Ian Baker at the Hampshire Bat Group, who uses thermal imaging cameras to study bat behaviour and monitor the species. ""It's incredible to get insights of Daubenton's bats skimming across the water,"" he said. ""We're still learning about them because this time of year they seem to do a lot of courting and very strange gymnastics over the water."" The group has recorded around 10 species locally and reports that numbers are relatively stable.

The Environment, Housing, and Infrastructure Scrutiny Panel said the impact of the proposals from came at a time of growing regulatory needs, including a move to address food labelling and allergies. Panel chair Hilary Jeune said she feared the proposed cuts - which involved the department finding £749,000 from staffing costs - could ""hit the competitiveness of our economy, livelihoods and essential regulatory work"". Environment Minister Steve Luce told the panel ""dark clouds on the horizon are starting to roll in"" and there were significant challenges ahead. Luce said the funding cuts could cause particular challenges to sections of the department which already had small teams of two or three people. He said: ""If you reduce that team by one, it has a massive effect."" Jeune said given the minister had his own concerns about the cuts, it should be an issue everyone took note of. She added the cuts were a ""potential threat"" to the island's economic growth. ""Not only is the reduction in budget a worry, but there is no contingency financing at all for the department,"" Jeune said. ""That means any unexpected incidents, such as another major storm, a disease threat to livestock or the public, would mean other areas are de-prioritised further.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lg379e3mo

Conservation charity the Woodland Trust said the ""Frankenstein trees"" were hauled from Kingsettle Wood in Dorset to Yonder Oak in Devon and placed along the flight path of barn owls, sparrowhawks and kestrels. They said the deadwood would offer a safe perch for the ""magnificent"" birds of prey. Sam Hamer, the charity's site manager, said: ""By bolting on extra branches from other dead trees and then slashing them with chainsaws to create nooks and crannies, we are encouraging birds, bats, beetles, fungi and many more creatures and organisms to make their homes here."" Mr Hamer said: ""Deadwood creates habitat for wildlife, and standing deadwood like this is even more special, because it is drier than most deadwood and has become rare in British woodlands. ""We hope that when the tree saplings we've planted at Yonder Oak are fully grown trees, there will already be a healthy ecosystem around them to help the woodland thrive."" The charity said the work had been made possible with funding from Screwfix, which contributed £100,000 to Kingsettle Wood over the past two years.

2025-11-06,COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction,science,BBC,"US President Donald Trump has been criticised by world leaders for his stance on climate change, ahead of the global COP30 summit. President Trump, who is not attending the meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar by the leaders of Colombia and Chile for his rejection of climate science. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political support on climate change. He said it had been a unity issue internationally and in the UK but ""today sadly that consensus is gone"". Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection. Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit. And while Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present. Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"". He said: ""The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally."" Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of ""extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming"". The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action. Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: ""The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth."" But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder. Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures. Despite Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: ""My message is that the UK is all-in."" However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests. President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin. The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species. The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021. Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: ""The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away. It has caused real frustration to put it mildly here in Brazil... the Brazilian government behind the scenes is furious."" The decision also seems at odds with the stance of the Prince of Wales. Also addressing leaders on Thursday he declared the fund ""a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability"" and shortlisted it for his £1m Earthshot Prize. Prince William tried to encourage leaders to overcome their differences and move forward with action. ""I have long believed in the power of urgent optimism: the conviction that, even in the face of daunting challenges, we have the ingenuity and determination to make a difference, and to do so now,"" he said. And he urged them to take action for the sake of their children and grandchildren. ""Let us rise to this moment with the clarity that history demands of us. Let us be the generation that turned the tide - not for applause, but for the quiet gratitude of those yet to be born,"" he said. From Monday, countries will spend two weeks negotiating further action on climate change - with crucial questions on how to raise finance previously pledged for those already affected by the worst impacts of climate change. The last few weeks have seen devastating extreme weather globally. Hurricane Melissa, which hit the Caribbean last week, is one of the strongest the island nations have ever experienced - resulting in the deaths of more than 75 people. Recent analysis from Imperial College has suggested that climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with the Category 5 hurricane by 16%. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

2025-11-07,Typhoon which killed almost 200 in Philippines and Vietnam weakens,science,BBC,"Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 188 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam, according to the latest figures from the two countries. The storm is now headed west to Cambodia and Laos after it barrelled through central Vietnam on Thursday with winds of up to 149km/h (92mph). Towns along Vietnam's central coast were littered with debris this morning after taking the full brunt of the storm overnight. The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people. Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean. Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated. Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported. Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City. Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area. According to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response. ""We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,"" he was quoted as saying. ""No one should be left hungry or cold."" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines. At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier. In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home. ""We don't have any home anymore,"" she told the BBC. ""We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. ""We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different."" Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jnx9e414o

They're desperately in need of some help,"" she added. Miss Wiles, 48, and a friend travelled to Jamaica on 22 October. She said: ""The bus driver and people in the airport were singing happy birthday to me. We were living our best lives. ""Then a few days in we got told that a category five hurricane was heading towards us."" The storm struck Jamaica on 28 October, when winds of up to 185mph (295 km/h) led to at least 28 deaths. Hotel managers advised guests that their bathrooms would be the safest place to stay. Mattresses and furniture became barricades, with cushions and pillows used as beds during an eight-hour ordeal. ""We could hear the winds whistling around the building. Rain water was coming under the hotel room door,"" Miss Wiles said. ""I told my friend before it even started, 'you can't die while you're with me'."" Part of the hotel roof was damaged, the hallway flooded and trees were uprooted. Miss Wiles was unable to contact friends and family for two days. ""The hardest part was not being able to let them [her children] know that I was OK. I was more worried about my kids being worried about me."" Miss Wiles flew home when a flight was available, but has been encouraging people to help via the appeals being run by established aid organisations such as the Red Cross. ""People are hungry, people are thirsty, people haven't got roofs over their heads."" She said it did not feel fair that she was home safe while others were suffering. ""If I would have been of any help to anybody, I would have stayed."" Miss Wiles booked the holiday a year before travelling. She was aware it was hurricane season, but was shocked when Melissa became a Category 5 storm.

Cherwell District Council said the change would end more than 30 years of residents taking their glass to bottle banks. From 1 January next year, householders will instead be able to put it in their blue recycling bin. The authority said the change would cost between £300,000 and £400,000 due to lost income from bottle banks and higher ""gate fees"" at waste management facilities. The change will help the authority comply with the new that comes into force in April 2026. It is anticipated the change will improve the district's overall recycling rate by up to 1.5%. More than 100 bottle banks around the district will be removed, which the council said would help prevent fly-tipping. Councillor Ian Middleton, portfolio holder for neighbourhood services, said: ""The collection of glass from the kerbside is one of the most requested changes to our recycling service, and we have been listening. ""This change will make it faster and more convenient for residents to recycle whilst reducing the problems associated with bottle banks.

2025-11-06,Mega battery energy storage facility approved,science,BBC,"A 200-megawatt battery facility has been approved after council officials decided the scheme's national benefits outweighed local concerns. The four-hectare complex, seen as a vital part of the UK's net zero ambitions, will see 612 batteries, each 3m tall, installed on farmland near the village of Walpole, west Norfolk. The scheme, covering an area of up to eight football pitches, has already generated strong opposition in the surrounding area. It will store energy generated by intermittent renewable sources, including solar farms, which are planned for the region, to provide back-up capacity for the National Grid. Council officers presented a document to councillors which argued that while the loss of agricultural land was recognised, considerable weight should be attached to the benefits of the battery energy storage system. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, councillors expressed their frustration about national policies which they said left them little room to block the project. Vivienne Spikings, Conservative, said the planning committee was ""hamstrung"", adding: ""If we refuse it, it goes to the National Grid – rubber stamp. ""We can make suggestions, objections, reasons, but we're whistling in the wind and it is rather self defeating."" Walpole Parish Council and various locals had submitted objections to the plans, raising concerns about the loss of high-grade agricultural land, noise and safety risks regarding battery fires. Richard Blunt, who represents the Walpole ward, said he did not oppose the energy storage facilities but believed the current scheme was ""in the wrong place"". A case officer said the proximity to the existing Walpole substation made the site technically suitable. The site – which will host 68 rows of batteries – is within 50m (164ft) of two properties and adjacent to the Walpole National Grid substation. Developers have pledged to install a 3.5m (11.5 ft) acoustic timber fence to try and contain the sound levels. Under the permission, the site will operate for 30 years by the applicant, STP Green Limited,  before being decommissioned and restored to farmland.

2025-11-08,What does Roman skeletons find mean for Chelmsford?,science,BBC,"The discovery of the graves of three skeletons underneath a car park has sparked a conversation about who they were and in what period they might have been buried. dated back to the Roman era, with one potentially belonging to a Roman official or army officer. This is not the first time the city has made headlines for its Roman links, after the discovery of the small market town of Caesaromagus, which was located near the recent excavation site. Ben Paites, 34, senior collections and learning curator at Colchester Museums, said the bodies were found on what was once an old Roman road. Three Roman skeletons were uncovered at Moulsham Street car park in Chelmsford, Essex, which is being redeveloped into affordable homes. Archaeologists from Archaeology South East have been excavating the site in advance of the redevelopment and said the remains uncovered were believed to date back to the late Roman period. Tetra Tech, which coordinated the archaeological work on site, said the remains were in a ""fairly poor condition"" and they had been removed for analysis and would be taken to a museum. Dr Nick Cooke, an archaeologist at RPS Tetra Tech, said: ""The excavations have given us important new evidence about the extent of Roman Chelmsford, and in particular the Roman cemetery known to flank Moulsham Street. ""While we weren't expecting to find graves, previous trial trenching on the site did unearth a disturbed skill, so it was always a possibility."" Mr Paites said: ""It is exciting when new discoveries have been found, but the likelihood is there won't be more information. ""Most of the time, we don't learn more about the people buried."" Mr Paites studied about the Romans while he was at university but said his interest in the era first sparked while learning Latin at school. The Roman-expert also said it was common for police to be called when human remains were found, but the skeletons were likely to have been buried with items that would have identified them to be from that time. It said it was believed the burial could be of a Roman official or Army officer, as one of the skeletons was buried with a copper alloy crossbow brooch at the shoulder, suggesting it was worn with a cloak and a belt buckle. It is likely that the remains are going to be put up in a museum or to be reburied at a different site. Chelmsford City Council said the small Roman market town of Caesaromagus laid to the south of the River Can. It followed the line of the main Roman road linking London to Chelmsford and Colchester, created to the north of Moulsham Street. The town was founded about the time of the Boudiccan uprising in 61 CE as a military road station. It became derelict and remained so until Norman times when the river crossing was re-established in 1100 and a new town was founded north of the river in 1199. Previous excavations off Moulsham Street and Hall Street revealed narrow, thatched timber houses which once lined the Roman street. A number of burials had also been found further down Moulsham Street at Godfreys Mews and in Rothesay Avenue, the council said. Digs between Mildmay Road and Roman Road have uncovered the heating system of the Roman baths. Earlier this year a ""one-of-a-kind"" cache of went on permanent display close to where it was discovered. The Great Baddow Hoard, which was rediscovered in 2020, was a ""nationally significant"" find because it was Britain's largest recorded Iron Age gold coin hoard, according to experts. It was acquired by the Museum of Chelmsford following a £250,000 National Lottery Heritage Fund grant. Curator Claire Willetts previously told the BBC it ""could have been intended as a tribute payment to Roman general Julius Caesar"".

The track was likely to have been in full use between the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, according to the Colchester Archaeological Trust. It was probably constructed on the orders of Emperor Hadrian, who visited Britain in the year 122 CE. The trust said the track was 450 metres (1,476ft) long and about 74 metres (243ft) wide, and would have had six tiers of seating for more than 8,000 spectators.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40wn94pyko

Prince William said he was ""deeply moved"" by the resilience of the people in Pontypridd, whom he ""One resident told me how the river that once brought life to the town had become a source of fear,"" he said, in a high-profile speech given in the city of Belem, in the heart of the Amazon. The prince called for ""courage, co-operation and unwavering commitment"" to tackle the climate crisis, warning of a ""critical tipping point"" ahead. ""We must ask ourselves, what legacy do we wish to leave?"" said Prince William, who was joined by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and  Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the annual climate summit. The prince warned humanity was edging towards the ""Earth's critical tipping points"", citing ""the melting of polar ice, the loss of the Amazon, the disruption of ocean currents"". ""These are not distant threats,"" he said. ""They are fast-approaching and will affect every one of us, no matter where we live."" In Pontypridd, earlier this year, the prince said he and the princess met ""families who had lost their homes, their possessions, and their sense of security"". ""Their resilience was deeply moving. ""It was also a powerful reminder that climate change is not a distant threat,"" he said. ""It is affecting lives across the UK, and across the world - from small towns to major cities, from coastal communities to inland regions. ""No corner of the globe will be unaffected."" Sir Keir spoke directly after Prince William, challenging climate sceptics with a promise to double-down on net zero, on the issue of climate change. The Prime Minister staunchly defended the UK government's clean energy agenda, but conceded that cross-party unity on science ""that is unequivocal"" has splintered, both in Britain and globally. Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit. After Thursday's speech, the prince posed for a picture with Brazil's president, Lula, and Sir Keir, laughing as they brought their hands together in a triple handshake, and walking off the stage in unison. The speech at COP30 was Prince William's highest-profile public address to date, speaking on behalf of the UK government and his father, King Charles, with whom he shared the contents of his address before his departure for Brazil. ""I grew up with my father – the King – talking about the power of nature and the importance of harmony in the natural world,"" he said. ""A subject he has championed for over five decades. ""It is a privilege to also represent him here today, as well as everyone else who has championed this cause, for so many years."" The prince also praised as ""visionary"" a Brazilian-led fund for rainforests – seen as key to the UN Cop30 climate summit, but which the British Government has said it will not currently invest in, ahead of the Budget later this month. Prince William's five-day trip to Brazil, his first to the country, included ""When we unite behind shared purpose, we can scale and accelerate solutions that transcend borders,"" he told delegates at COP30. ""Solutions that give us hope, and fill us with optimism, for the future."" He went on to talk about one of the Earthshot Prize finalists, as he called for unity in the fight for climate change. ""Brazil's proposal for the Tropical Forests Forever fund is a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability. That is why it was an Earthshot Prize finalist this year. ""The initiative recognises that climate and nature must be addressed together – not in silos, but in synergy.

The Missing Lynx Project is working to reintroduce the species into Northumberland after Supporters said restoring lynx, which were native to the UK before going extinct 500 to 1,000 years ago, could help control the populations of animals such as deer and lead to more balanced ecosystems. However, Wearmouth said there were also concerns they could target livestock.

2025-11-06,How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?,science,BBC,"Typhoon Kalmaegi - one of the strongest of 2025 - has caused severe flooding in the Philippines, where it left at least 114 dead, before heading for Vietnam. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide. But warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding. Hurricanes are powerful storms which develop in warm tropical ocean waters. parts of the world, they are known as cyclones or typhoons. Collectively, these storms are referred to as ""tropical cyclones"". Tropical cyclones are characterised by very high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and - short-term rises to sea-levels. This often causes widespread damage and flooding. Hurricanes can be categorised by their peak sustained wind speed. Major hurricanes are rated category three and above, meaning they reach at least 111mph (178km/h). Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones begin as atmospheric - such as, for example, a tropical wave, an area of low pressure where thunderstorms and clouds develop. As warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, winds begin to spin. The process is linked to how the Earth's rotation affects winds in tropical regions just away from the equator. For a hurricane to develop and keep spinning, the sea surface generally needs to be at least 27C to provide enough energy, and the winds need to not vary much with height. If all these factors come together, an intense hurricane can form, although the exact causes of individual storms are complex. Globally, the frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased over the past century, and in fact the - although long-term data is limited in some regions. But it is ""likely"" that a higher proportion of tropical cyclones across the globe have reached category three or above over the past four decades, meaning they reach the highest wind speeds, according to the UN's climate body, The IPCC quotes ""medium confidence"" that there has been an increase in the average and peak rainfall rates associated with tropical cyclones. . This is where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly, which can be especially dangerous. There also seems to have been a across the Earth's surface. This typically brings more rainfall for a given location. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey ""stalled"" over Houston, releasing In some places, the average location where tropical cyclones reach their peak intensity has shifted poleward - for example the . This can expose new communities to these hazards. the increased intensity of US hurricanes means they are causing more damage. Assessing the precise influence of climate change on individual tropical cyclones can be challenging due to the complexity of these storm systems. But rising temperatures can affect these storms in several ways. Firstly, warmer ocean waters mean storms can pick up more energy, leading to higher wind speeds. Maximum wind speeds of hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 were boosted by an estimated 19mph (30km/h) on average as a result of human-driven ocean warming, Secondly, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall. Climate change made the extreme rainfall from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 around three times more likely, Finally, sea-levels are rising, mainly due to a combination of , and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. Local factors can also play a part. This means storm surges happen on top of already elevated sea levels, For example, it is estimated that flood heights from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - one of America's deadliest storms - were higher than they would have been in the climate conditions of 1900. that there is ""high confidence"" that humans have contributed to increases in precipitation associated with tropical cyclones, and ""medium confidence"" that humans have contributed to the higher probability of a tropical cyclone being more intense. The number of tropical cyclones globally is unlikely to increase, according to But as the world warms, it says it is ""very likely"" they will have higher rates of rainfall and reach higher top wind speeds. This means a higher proportion would reach the most intense categories, four and five. The more global temperatures rise, the more extreme these changes will tend to be. The proportion of tropical cyclones reaching category four and five may increase by around 10% if global temperature rises are limited to 1.5C, increasing to 13% at 2C and 20% at 4C, the IPCC says - although the exact numbers are uncertain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz913gxlw3jo

2025-11-05,"How climate change worsens heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and floods",science,BBC,"Many extreme weather events are becoming more common and more intense around the world, fuelled by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. Here are four ways that rising temperatures are affecting weather extremes. Even a small increase in average temperatures makes a big difference to heat extremes. As the range of daily temperatures shifts to warmer levels, hotter days become more likely and more intense. Scientists use computer models to simulate how individual extreme weather events unfold in two scenarios: how much a particular heatwave, storm or drought was affected by climate change. In the UK, temperatures topped 40C for the first time on record in July 2022, causing , according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution group (WWA). In June 2025, the Met Office said the chance of seeing temperatures above 40C was than during than 1960s. And the likelihood of reaching such temperatures will continue to rise as the world warms, it said. Around the world, climate change has made countless heatwaves much more likely and more intense, the WWA says. in July 2025, with temperatures regularly passing 30C in Norway. Heatwaves can happen as a result of , which are created when an area of high pressure stays over the same area for days or weeks, trapping hot air underneath. One theory suggests that higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has - are affecting the fast band of winds high in the atmosphere known as the jet stream. That could be making heat domes more likely, although this is not clear cut. For every 1C rise in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold With more moisture available, rainfall can become heavier. Between October 2023 and March 2024, the UK experienced the second-wettest such period on record. This level of rainfall was made by human-caused warming, according to the WWA. , including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy. The intensity of the rainfall over four days in mid-September was made Globally, heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense over most land regions due to human activity, It says this pattern will continue with further warming. Various factors affect whether such heavy rainfall leads to flooding, including the quality of flood defences and drainage systems. Linking climate change with specific individual droughts can be difficult, because there are lots of different factors that affect the availability of water. Natural weather systems, for example, can play a key role, as was the case with But climate change is shifting global rainfall patterns. While some of the world is getting wetter, other parts are becoming drier, which can make them more prone to drought. And heatwaves fuelled by climate change can worsen dry conditions when they do occur, by increasing evaporation from the soil. This makes the air above warm up more quickly, leading to more intense heat. During periods of hot weather, increased demand for water, especially from farmers, puts even more stress on the water supply. In parts of East Africa, there were between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40 years. This displaced Climate change has made droughts like this Human-caused warming was also the main driver of , the WWA found. This was the region's worst drought since modern records began. Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world. It is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened a specific wildfire because other factors are also relevant, such as changes to the way land is used. But climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, Extreme, long-lasting heat draws more moisture out of soils and vegetation. These tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong. The north-east Amazon experienced an extreme fire season in early 2024. Climate change made the weather conditions that helped the fires to spread between 30 and 70 times more likely, according to a That meant the burned area was about four times greater than if humans hadn't heated up the planet, the scientists found. Meanwhile, the burned area in the was about 25 times larger due to climate change, they estimated, although there are large uncertainties in the precise figures. Many fires are started deliberately or accidentally by humans. But rising temperatures may also in the world's northernmost forests, which can in turn trigger more fires. The combined effects of shifting land use and climate change mean extreme wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense globally, according to the The number of the most extreme fires may rise by up to 50% by 2100, UNEP suggests. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

The Pirbright Institute's Professor Ian Brown, formerly director of science at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), said farmers should be ""prepared for the worst"". With a national mandatory housing order brought into force in England on Thursday, one free-range egg producer in Wiltshire told the BBC she felt ""terrible"" bringing her 32,000 hens inside but an outbreak would be ""disastrous"". The government said the mandatory housing order would ""bring the rates of infection down from the high we are currently experiencing"". So far this season - which began in October - (HPAI) H5N1 on farms across the UK, with 22 in England alone. Whole flocks have to be culled when an outbreak occurs. Professor Brown told the BBC that the current virus was ""as super-infectious as any high pathogenicity avian influenza we've ever seen"". He added that farmers should now ""prepare for the worst, I'm afraid"". ""We had a very, very serious epidemic between 2021 and 2023 - in excess of 350 outbreaks in the UK. That's off the scale,"" he explained. ""Now, it's really, really difficult to state what the final size of this outbreak would be, but the early signals are not great."" He added that the threat level meant the poultry industry needed to ""batten the hatches down, review their biosecurity and redouble their efforts"". Sarah Godwin runs a mixed egg, arable and dairy family farm near North Wraxall, in Wiltshire, with her husband and brother-in-law. Her 32,000-laying hens would normally be outdoors for most of the day. They now have to be kept in their barns around the clock. ""It is terrible. We would love to see them out but it is just a necessary evil because the risk of them catching avian influenza is so high and the consequences are so disastrous for a producer, and for the hens as well,"" she explained. But despite bringing the hens inside and putting in place strict biosecurity measures, Mrs Godwin remains ""very nervous"". She said: ""It only takes a tiny, tiny bit of contaminated muck from a wild bird or something that's been brought into the shed on somebody's boots. ""It's literally grammes that can infect the whole flock. And at that point, the whole flock has to be culled."" The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) still says the risk to the general public's health is ""very low"" while the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said bird flu poses a very low food safety risk and that properly-cooked poultry and eggs are safe to eat. But Professor Brown warned that the virus needed to be continually monitored for mutation. ""The good news is, basically, these viruses are still bird viruses. They don't want to be in a human,"" he said. ""We have to continually monitor the virus, because it's an influenza virus and influenza viruses change. ""Even when they're happy in a species such as birds they still undergo changes. They make mistakes and errors when they replicate. ""So that could always spew out a variant that might be more infectious for humans."" The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss urged all bird keepers to comply with the new housing measures and to continue to exercise ""robust biosecurity measures, remain alert for any signs of disease and report suspected disease immediately to the Animal and Plant Health Agency"".

2025-11-06,Three Roman skeletons found buried under car park,science,BBC,"Three Roman skeletons including one believed to have been an official or Army officer have been uncovered underneath a city's car park. The graves were discovered by archaeologists working at the Moulsham Street car park in Chelmsford which is being redeveloped into affordable homes. Tetra Tech, which coordinated the archaeological work on site, said the remains were in a ""fairly poor condition"" and they had been removed for analysis and would be taken to a museum. James Gardner, who saw the remains as he walked by the site, said: ""Suddenly I saw a head and I could see the bones... It was really quite something to see that in the ground like that."" Archaeologists from Archaeology South East have been excavating the site in advance of the redevelopment and said the remains uncovered were believed to date back to the late Roman period. Tetra Tech said it was believed the burial could be of a Roman official or Army officer, as one of the skeletons was buried with a copper alloy crossbow brooch at the shoulder, suggesting it was worn with a cloak and a belt buckle. Mr Gardner said seeing the skeletons uncovered was ""really surreal"". ""I've never seen a skeleton in real life before, just lots of plastic Halloween ones,"" he said. ""It was a real shock... I was really intrigued by it and sort of surprised because the skull was so visual and clear to see and they were dusting it down gently."" Mr Gardner took a picture of the discovery and said he was shocked the remains were ""not that deep"" under the surface. including the small Roman market town of Caesaromagus, which lies close to the Moulsham Street car park. Chelmsford City Council said previous excavations off Moulsham Street and Hall Street revealed narrow, thatched timber houses that once lined the Roman street and a number of burials have been found further down Moulsham Street at Godfreys Mews and in Rothesay Avenue. While the first phase of excavations have been completed, the second phase is anticipated to start prior to construction. Dr Nick Cooke, an archaeologist at RPS Tetra Tech, said: ""The excavations have given us important new evidence about the extent of Roman Chelmsford, and in particular the Roman cemetery known to flank Moulsham Street. ""While we weren't expecting to find graves, previous trial trenching on the site did unearth a disturbed skull, so it was always a possibility.

The situation was highlighted in The visits were carried out between April 2024 and May this year - mainly at facilities in Annan and Lockerbie. The report concluded it suggested ""potential misuse of our facilities by commercial operators"" and that imposing some kind of limit on visits would now be considered as part of a wider review of the service. The council operates a network of 12 HWRCs across the region for residents to deposit waste, including items not collectible at kerbside such as electrical goods, rubble or DIY waste. They are located in towns across the region from Stranraer in the west to Annan in the east. Residents use an online booking system to obtain a time slot to leave their rubbish. However, one customer made 247 bookings between April 2024 and March this year - of which 218 were completed, 25 were cancelled and four were ""no shows"". The majority of them - 125 - were to the Annan centre, with 90 in Lockerbie and three at other sites. Another 254 users have booked more than 52 visits - equivalent to one a week - over the same time period. Now a review of the service will look at whether a maximum number of visits needs to be set. A communication campaign is also planned to ""educate and inform our citizens on what they can do to help improve our recycling figures and move away from the 'dump' culture"". That includes improved site signage being installed to improve recycling at HWRCs.

""In the past year alone, over 1.7 million hectares of the Amazon were cleared across this region... much of which is driven by illicit activity,"" he told the audience. Earlier, William visited the small Brazilian island of Paqueta - home to a population of just 4,000 - where he was greeted by dozens of people and given a baby to hold. After a first day consisting of an official welcome with football in the Maracana Stadium and barefoot beach volleyball on Copacabana, the future king's second day in Brazil - and reason for visiting - was focused on the environment. Hollywood star Leonardo Di Caprio recorded a video message at the summit, urging  world leaders meeting in Brazil to ""unite with courage and ambition"". Tuesday's wildlife summit organised by William - the first of its kind - highlighted the damage caused by environmental crime, and the prince announced a new fund for wildlife rangers. William described Latin America as a ""global leader in biodiversity and environmental conservation"". He criticised deforestation linked to criminal gangs, saying: ""This crime fuels violence and corruption, distorts legitimate economies, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of millions."" But he ended on an optimistic note: ""We must stand alongside those who everyday are standing up and defending nature. ""We must recognise and celebrate these protectors, not just in words but through our actions. And we must act together."" Prince William is in Brazil to present the Earthshot Prize, the annual award from the charity he set up, on Wednesday. He is also scheduled to give a speech at COP30, the UN's annual climate meeting where governments discuss how to limit and prepare for further climate change, the following day. Earlier on Tuesday he was taken by a Brazilian navy boat to the island of Paqueta, known for producing the West Ham and Brazil footballer, Lucas Paqueta. During a walkabout in the harbour, 10-month-old Joaquim Monteiro was thrust into his arms. ""Mustn't drop him,"" joked the father of three as he gave Joaquim a cuddle before handing him back to his grandparents. Andre Luis Junior, the baby's cousin and a teacher, said: ""We are so happy he chose this very small island. ""We're very unique in the heart of Rio. Very quiet. We love that he chose to come here. The kids in school were so excited today."" Just an hour away from Rio de Janeiro by boat, Paqueta is an escape from the intensity of the city. Cars are not allowed on the island with all travel is done on foot or in carriages. The pace of life is slow but the biodiversity of the region is rich. Back on the water, the prince was taken by boat into Guanabara Bay and shown the mangroves. The trees and shrubs which make up the mangroves are a protected area of natural beauty that has been replanted following deforestation. Their benefits are vast, from storing carbon to acting as buffer zones in stormy weather. Prince William was part of that conservation work planting saplings in the bay to ensure the survival of the mangroves. ""I hope they grow well, "" Prince William said.  ""Next time I come all this will all be mangroves."" While on Paqueta, the future king also spoke to local residents, with retired lawyer Glaucia Martinez, 60, saying he asked her about Paqueta. ""I said that it's safe, it's charming, and it's a good place to live,"" she said, adding that they all ""live in peace"". ""People here, they are good, good people, you know, honest people,"" she told the prince, before expressing her love for the Princess of Wales. Paqueta's mayor Rodrigo Toledo said it was ""very important "" for the prince to visit because the island is ""totally dedicated to environmental protection and we know that Prince William has dedicated his life to this agenda"". The Earthshot Prize Awards Ceremony will be held in Rio's futuristic Museum of Tomorrow. Kylie Minogue and Shawn Mendes will perform at the event on Wednesday evening. Five projects will each win a million pound prize for their environmental innovations. The shortlist includes the city of Guangzhou in China and its electric public transport network and Lagos Fashion Week in Nigeria, nominated for its work reshaping the fashion industry. Prince William will be concluding his Brazil visit with his COP30 appearance in Belem, in the Amazon rainforest. It marks the first time he has travelled internationally for a COP summit, with his father, King Charles III, having previously paved the way for the royals. The prince accompanied his father to the summit when it was held in Glasgow in 2021, two weeks after the first Earthshot Prize. The prize annually awards a £1m grant in five different categories for projects that aim to repair the world's climate - and the prince has committed himself to it for 10 years, with Rio marking a halfway point for the venture.

2025-11-05,Scientists develop new tool to identify meat in shop-bought meals,science,BBC,"Scientists in Aberdeen have developed a tool which they say will help tackle so-called food fraud and the addition of ""rogue ingredients"" to meals. The system developed at the University of Aberdeen's Rowett Institute can identify the type of meat in shop-bought meals, and the breed of animal it comes from. They say MEATiCode will help to determine the authenticity of the product and prevent cross contamination. Food fraud - purposely altering, misrepresenting or mislabeling a product - is estimated to cost the UK about £2bn a year. Those behind the technology, which is able to identify multiple meat species in one product, said it was the first of its kind and will help to protect consumers and improve food satefy. Scientists analysed beef, pork, chicken, lamb in their tests of shop-bought meals and found two cases where the meat was not as advertised. The results from one kebab showed none of the 14% lamb advertised was present. Another item which was said to be 60% lamb and 20% chicken was shown to contain twice as much chicken as lamb. In 17 other meals the meat content of the product was as advertised. Labelling a product wrongly can cause issues for those allergic to certain products or who cannot eat certain types of meat for religious reasons. Project lead Renata Garbellini Duft said: ""When you buy a burger in the supermarket you do not know what is inside - you just have to trust the label. ""But using this method we know exactly what is inside. ""In one single experiment we can detect a lot of different species."" Samples of meat are put into the machine and analysed against a database of eight species of meat by identifying unique peptides - short chains of amino acids - in the food. This provides a clear picture of where the food has come from. It has also been shown to be able to drill down far enough to identify particular breeds, such as Aberdeen Angus. ""It is a growing concern,"" Ms Garbellini Duft explained. ""Maybe it can lead to more testing and less money will be lost on food fraud. ""We hope this can help the meat industry to protect especially the local producers or some farms where they have this high quality meat."" After working on meat, the team hopes to move on to honey which is said to be ""one of the most frauded products"". They will also look into assessing whisky and adapting the technique to detect allergens such as nuts, fish and dairy products.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m37zxjll2o
2025-11-05,Construction under way for controversial incinerator,science,BBC,"Initial construction work has started at a controversial waste-to-energy incinerator site, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2028. The company behind the site in Westbury, Wiltshire, was given planning permission by the government in 2023, after years of protests from councils and residents. Northacre Renewable Energy Ltd (NREL) said the incinerator will generate electricity and be a ""safe, sustainable solution for non-recyclable waste"", but locals are concerned about issues including emissions. The government recently brought in for new incinerators, but they do not apply to those that have already been approved. Teams are busy constructing a bund – in industrial sites generally, this is a secondary containment system built around a tank to prevent the escape of spills or pollution. NREL said it would be finished by the end of December. Next year, construction will continue when planning conditions have been approved. The planning conditions, outlined in a government document, include the requirement for an air emissions management plan. There is also a stipulation that the total amount of waste taken to the incinerator should not exceed 243,000 tonnes a year. Of this, no more than 191,000 tonnes can be taken to the centre by road. The remainder can come from the existing waste recovery centre beside the incinerator. Over the last few years, Westbury Town Council, residents, and local MP Andrew Murrison have waged a campaign against the facility. Concerns range from the location, including proximity to housing, to air quality. Permission for the site was eventually granted when NREL appealed to the government's planning inspectorate. ""We lost, it had permission to be built,"" said Jane Russ, a town councillor and the mayor of Westbury. ""That ship has sailed."" She said the town council has now shifted its focus to air quality. It paid a consultant to advise on the best places for monitors in Westbury and has already installed them. ""If this incinerator gets built, we have a baseline of air quality to compare it to,"" said Ms Russ. ""We realised that was crucial in the research we did over the years."" NREL said the facility will mean more waste can be treated locally rather than having to be sent long distances. A spokesperson said: ""Energy recovery facilities result in less waste ending up in landfill. ""This is good news for the environment because landfill produces many more greenhouse gas emissions than other methods of waste treatment."" NREL said it will ""use state of the art technology to work as safely, efficiently and sustainably as possible"".

One key aim was to try to limit future global temperature rises to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels. However, ahead of the COP30 meeting in Brazil in November 2025, UN secretary general António Guterres has said that overshooting that target is now ""inevitable"". The Paris agreement is at the heart of the international commitment to tackle rising global temperatures. and saw almost all the nations of the world agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming. However, US President Donald Trump has once again Trump pulled the world's second biggest greenhouse gas emitter out of the Paris accord during his first US presidential term. under his successor President Joe Biden. Leaving again would mean the US would rejoin Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries outside the agreement. The Paris agreement lists a series of commitments: The 1.5C target is generally accepted to refer to a 20-year average, rather than a single year. , it did not mean the Paris agreement threshold has been breached. Every 0.1C of warming brings with it greater risks for the planet, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires, But a very large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring , on top of those felt at 1.5C, UN scientists say. Some changes could become irreversible if so-called ""tipping points"" are crossed. It is not clear exactly where these sit, but once these thresholds are passed, changes could accelerate and become irreversible.

There are currently 63 equipped tenanted farms in Staffordshire along with additional rural properties and land, covering approximately 6,500 acres. The county council first began offering farms for rent in 1908, with a focus on stock rearing and dairy production. Deputy leader Martin Murray said it would help young farmers ""get on the ladder"". Most of the farms are operated as dairy units, while others focus on rearing beef cattle and sheep and a few on arable production. Holdings are available to new entrants into the industry as well as those looking to progress their farming careers. Members of the authority's cabinet also spoke out against the use of farmland on the county estate for solar panels and battery energy storage - but said the use of its buildings would be considered. The selling off of county farms in Staffordshire has proved controversial in previous years. In 2008 the council's then-Labour administration considered sales – a move that was strongly opposed by the agricultural community and later dropped. Several farms have been sold in more recent years however. In 2019 the council's then-Conservative administration revealed plans to sell off 16 farms from its rural estate to raise funds for services. The authority aimed to bring in around £20m from the sales, with proceeds earmarked for investments in health, care and infrastructure. Farms sold in the first round included sites in Rugeley, Gnosall, Eccleshall and Hilderstone. Explaining the policy, the council's deputy leader Martin Murray posted on social media ""we believe in food security, we believe in helping new farmers, young farmers get on the ladder to feed our nation."" Councillor Jack Rose, who became the authority's first Green Party councillor when he was elected in May, expressed support for the stance. ""It's important to protect the future of our agricultural productivity in our county,"" he said.

2025-11-05,What is net zero and is the UK on track to achieve it?,science,BBC,"Achieving ""net zero"" is the world's key strategy to fight climate change, which is already having serious consequences for people and nature around the globe. But the political consensus around the UK's net zero policies has collapsed, with opponents now branding them too difficult and expensive. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming ""greenhouse"" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere. Effectively this means no longer adding to the total amount of these gases in the atmosphere to limit climate change. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Their levels in the atmosphere are increasing rapidly due to human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, chopping down of forests and farming. In practice, reducing these emissions means largely switching away from coal, oil and gas to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar power. It also involves adopting green technologies like electric vehicles and heat pumps in place of petrol or diesel cars and gas boilers. But not all emissions – for example in agriculture and aviation - can be eliminated. So remaining emissions need to be matched by things like planting extra trees, restoring peatlands or using machines to take CO2 directly out of the air. But there are limits to these ""carbon removal"" techniques in scale and cost. That is why most of the focus is on drastically reducing emissions in the first place. The world is warming because of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, which increase global temperatures by trapping extra energy in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface. Further emissions will continue to warm the planet. ""Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions,"" confirms the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of leading scientists whose reports are signed off by governments around the world. In the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, nearly 200 countries committed to reaching net zero globally in the second half of this century. It's widely accepted that richer nations will need to get to net zero before poorer ones, which have often fewer resources to switch to cleaner technologies and have contributed less to climate change historically. The UK's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen sharply: in 2024 they were 54% lower than in 1990, according to provisional data. This figure only includes emissions generated within the UK - in line with UN reporting standards - and not emissions from products manufactured abroad and imported. Successive UK governments have pledged to reach net zero by 2050 and the target was written into law in 2019. To help achieve this, the current Labour government has committed to: However, in June 2025, the government's independent adviser, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), warned that When former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May signed in 2019, it passed through parliament with the support of all the major parties. . The term ""net zero"" is often used by critics to attack environmental targets, which they claim are being put ahead of economic goals. The Labour government is still committed to the 2050 goal, a policy also supported by the Liberal Democrats. Both parties want the the UK to take the lead on fighting climate change, which they rate as one of the greatest challenges facing the country. And they argue that it's in the UK's economic interest to wean itself off fossil fuels, which can be volatile in price. Gas and oil supplies can also be interrupted by international events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the Conservatives and Reform UK want to scrap the UK's net zero target. These two parties say that current plans are too costly and unachievable. They argue that, in isolation, the UK's efforts make little difference to climate change, not least because UK emissions are much smaller than those of countries like China and the US. By contrast, the Green Party wants net zero ""as soon as possible, and more than a decade ahead of 2050"", because of ""the urgency of the climate crisis"". The SNP has targeted net zero by 2045 for Scotland. Plaid Cymru wants to accelerate the transition to net zero in Wales, but has not committed to a specific date. There is no single path to net zero either for the world as a whole or for an individual country; different policies and technologies bring different costs and benefits. That means there is no fixed price. But, for the UK, the Climate Change Committee estimates a net cost equivalent of about 0.2% of the country's GDP per year between 2025 and 2050, based on its suggested path. This would require tens of billions of pounds a year in upfront investment by the end of the 2020s. Most of this is expected to come from the private sector, not direct government spending, the CCC says. It calculates that the savings from moving away from fossil fuels to cleaner, more efficient technologies Multiple studies have found that, globally, the economic cost of tackling climate change is much smaller than letting warming continue unchecked, which would result in widespread and increasing climate hazards. However, as with any transition, the costs and benefits can be unequally felt. For example, while there is huge potential for new clean energy jobs, those employed in the oil and gas industry are likely to be negatively affected. - which was the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide in 2024 - is aiming for . Its plans to cut emissions are not fully developed, but its electric vehicle sales and renewable energy sector have been is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - and still produces more CO2 than China per head of population.

They have pledged to reach net zero by 2060 and 2070 respectively. .

2025-11-03,Beer from Victorian Arctic expedition to be opened,science,BBC,"A brewer plans to open up a 150-year-old bottle of beer, made for an Arctic expedition, so a modern version can be created. The original Allsopp's Arctic Ale was bottled in Burton-upon-Trent for Sir George Nares, when he set out to reach the North Pole in 1875. It was later discovered in a box in a garage in Gobowen, Shropshire, and The buyer was Dougal Gunn Sharp, founder and master brewer of Edinburgh-based Innis & Gunn, and he now plans to use the ale to seed a new limited-edition beer. Samuel Allsopp & Sons in Burton-upon-Trent designed the beer for sailors enduring temperatures as low as -40C and it had an alcohol strength of about 9%. The beer was said to resist freezing because of its unfermentable sugars and it had six times the calorie content of conventional beer. It was used on a number of British Arctic expeditions and records from the time said it was dark brown and so thick it had to be lifted from the brewing copper in buckets. Mr Sharp plans to work in partnership with Allsopp's Brewery on the new beer, which will be called Innis & Gunn 1875 Arctic Ale. He said: ""Some people might think it's madness to open it, but I think the real madness would be to leave it sitting on a shelf. ""Beer is meant to be shared, particularly on this, its 150th anniversary."" Mr Sharp also said there was ""something very special"" about being able to taste a ""piece of brewing and maritime history"". Jamie Allsopp, founder of the revived Allsopp's Brewery and a direct descendant of Samuel Allsopp, said there was ""something uniquely romantic about Allsopp's Arctic Ale"". He said the beer was ""one of the strongest and most extraordinary beers ever made"" and he said when he was first approached by Mr Sharp with the idea of making a new version ""I honestly thought he was mad."" The idea of using the original beer to create a new one was ""a kind of alchemy"", he said. The new beer will be released later this year, with a small number of hand-bottled examples sold through a ballot.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620v1xgz10o
2025-11-03,Hedgehog warnings ahead of bonfires and winter,science,BBC,"Those celebrating bonfire night have been warned to keep a lookout for hedgehogs. Many of the prickly mammals look to these piles of trees and logs to hibernate in over winter. This summer has also been particularly hot, which means many hedgehogs have struggled to feed up for the winter. The RSPCA says it has seen a 74.6% increase in the number of hedgehog admissions to its four main rescue centres between 2022 and 2024, and charities warn that 2025 could be a particularly difficult winter for this much loved animal. Rachel Bright, vet nurse at Folly Wildlife Rescue in Kent, said the animals ""struggle with a really hot summer because their main food source is slugs and snails, so when it's really dry there's less food"". ""They struggle with dehydration,"" she said. She says that as we enter hibernating season, we can all make sure that we do our best to keep hedgehogs safe and well. Recommendations from the charity include not setting up bonfires too far in advance, checking them to ensure there are no hibernating animals inside, and providing overgrown parts of the garden, linked by walkways that the hogs can use to get around. Ms Bright said: ""We are the reason that hedgehogs are declining so we have to play our part."" Data from the RSPCA on hedgehog admissions at four wildlife centres across the country shows that since 2022 there has been an increase in the number of animals being admitted. In 2024, 2,263 hedgehogs were admitted to the rescue centres. Mallydams Wood, Hastings, said it had seen an increase of 113% in the number of admissions between 2022 and 2023. Despite the number of hedgehog admissions increasing, data shows that the overall hedgehog population is decreasing. According to the National Gamebag Census, the number of hedgehogs in the South East has declined by 25% between 1994 and 2019. .

Mel Harrison picked up the hand-sized flintstone which tour guide Martin Simpson immediately recognised as a Stone Age implement last Wednesday at Brook Bay, Newport on the Isle of Wight. Ms Harrison was joined on the walk by her husband Tony, her friend Laura and ""keen fossil hunters"" Jack and Charlie both aged nine. She said: ""It's incredible to think that this stone tool was made between 250,000-600,000 years ago and has lain undiscovered all this time."" The flintstone was authenticated by Dr Ferrero, the Isle of Wight Finds Liaisons Officer, who confirmed the stone tool was ""a Palaeolithic or pre-Palaeolithic hand axe perfectly intact and could possibly be the oldest to be found on the island"". Mr Simpson, from Island Gems Fossil Trip, has been working on the island for 40 years and said ""it had the right look and feel about it"". He explained ""these finds are exceedingly rare and emanate from a time when the island was joined to the mainland"". ""The coastal erosion in this case is actually doing some good by uncovering rare treasures,"" he added.

2025-11-03,Bird flu outbreaks confirmed at two farms,science,BBC,"Outbreaks of bird flu have been confirmed at two poultry farms in Lincolnshire. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the cases were at commercial farms in the south of the county. A protection zone of almost two miles (3km) and an eight-mile (10km) surveillance zone have been declared around both sites. All birds on the premises will be humanely culled, Defra said. The first case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was confirmed in commercially bred poultry near Swineshead, Boston, on 31 October. A second outbreak was reported at a farm near Donington, South Holland, on 1 November. The protection zone measures restrict the movement of birds, meat and eggs in the area. The virus spreads through birds' droppings and saliva, or through contaminated feed and water. Scientists say the current risk to humans is low. Transmission from birds to humans is rare and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission. saw bird flu measures brought in requiring owners to keep their flock on a strict lockdown in their housing.

2025-11-04,Delhi's lonely African elephant was killed by rare rodent-borne virus,science,BBC,"A rodent-borne virus led to the death of the only African elephant at the zoo in India's capital Delhi, officials have told the BBC. after spending much of his life in isolation. The cause of his death wasn't known at the time. Now, an autopsy has revealed that the elephant tested positive for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Delhi Zoo director Sanjeet Kumar said. EMCV is known to cause fatal inflammation of the heart and sometimes brain fever in mammals. The virus is spread through rodent faeces and urine. Most outbreaks of EMCV have been associated with captive animals in pig farms, primate research centres and zoos, according to the MSD veterinary manual. The virus replicates rapidly and can attack the heart and sometimes the brain, often causing sudden death. There is no specific antiviral cure available for EMCV so far. According to a 2012 study in the peer-reviewed medical journal Virulence, EMCV has been documented around the world in pigs, rodents, big cats and African elephants, among other mammals. The virus, according to a report in Nature, was first isolated in 1945 from a gibbon in Florida. Since the 1970s, local outbreaks have been reported in the US, South Africa, China, Australia, Canada, South America and several countries in Europe. The outbreaks in the US and South Africa particularly affected captive African elephants. In India, the virus was first isolated in the late 1960s. But Shankar's is the first ""recorded"" death caused by EMCV in India, a senior official at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) told the BBC, adding that ""there may have been unreported instances of mammals dying because of EMCV"". Shankar's autopsy was conducted at IVRI. Mr Kumar, the zoo director, did not answer specific questions about how Shankar may have got the infection and whether there was a rodent problem at the zoo. ""It is a rare virus and I am not an expert on it,"" he said. Shankar's death had triggered sadness among animal lovers and activists who had long sought to rehabilitate the lonely animal. He was among two African elephants that arrived in India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe to former Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma. But Shankar's companion died in 2001. He was then temporarily lodged with Asian elephants in the zoo, but the plan did not work. In 2012, Shankar was moved to a new enclosure that left him virtually in solitary confinement - despite a 2009 federal ban on keeping elephants alone for more than six months. He remained there until his death. For years, activists had demanded that Shankar be removed from the zoo and rehabilitated in a wildlife sanctuary that houses other African elephants. In 2021, a petition in Delhi's high court sought Shankar's to a sanctuary with other African elephants. Two years later, the court dismissed the petition, directing the petitioner to approach a committee handling transfers of wild animals by zoos. After Shankar's death, there is only one African elephant left in India - an adult male at Mysore Zoo in southern Karnataka state. He has also been living alone for years.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn402xgqx8wo
2025-11-03,Antarctic glacier's rapid retreat sparks scientific 'whodunnit',science,BBC,"When an Antarctic glacier was sparked into rapid retreat three years ago, it left scientists scratching their heads as to what might have caused it. Hektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8km (5 miles) in just two months in late 2022 - and now a new study claims to have the answer. The authors believe that Hektoria could be the first modern example of a process where the front of a glacier resting on the seabed rapidly destabilises. That could lead to much faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere in Antarctica, they say. But other scientists argue that this part of the glacier was actually floating in the ocean – so while the changes are impressive, they are not so unusual. Floating tongues of glaciers extending into the sea – called ice shelves – are much more prone to breaking up than glacier fronts resting on the seabed. That's because they can be more easily eaten away by warm water underneath. That Hektoria has undergone huge change is not contested. Its front retreated by about 25km (16 miles) between January 2022 and March 2023, satellite data shows. But unravelling the causes is like a ""whodunnit"" mystery, according to study lead author Naomi Ochwat, research affiliate at the University of Colorado Boulder and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Innsbruck. The case began way back in 2002 with the extraordinary collapse of an ice shelf called Larsen B in the eastern Antarctic Peninsula. About 3250 sq km (1250 sq miles) of ice shelf was lost, roughly the size of Cambridgeshire or Gloucestershire. Larsen B had been effectively holding Hektoria Glacier back. Without it, Hektoria's movement sped up and the glacier thinned. But the bay vacated by the ice shelf was eventually filled with sea-ice ""fastened"" to the seabed, helping to partly stabilise Hektoria. That was until early 2022, when the sea-ice broke up. What followed was further loss of floating ice from the front of Hektoria, as large, flat-topped icebergs broke off or ""calved"", and the ice behind sped up and thinned. That is not unusual. Iceberg calving is a natural part of ice sheet behaviour, even though human-caused makes the loss of ice shelves much more likely. What was unprecedented, the authors argue, was what happened in late 2022, when they suggest the front of the glacier was ""grounded"" - resting on the seabed - rather than floating. In just two months, Hektoria retreated by 8.2km. That would be nearly ten times faster than any grounded glacier recorded before, according to the study, published in This extraordinary change, the authors say, could be thanks to an ice plain - a relatively flat area of bedrock on which the glacier lightly rests. Upward forces from the ocean water could ""lift"" the thinning ice essentially all at once, they argue - causing icebergs to break off and the glacier to retreat in quick time. ""Glaciers don't usually retreat this fast,"" said co-author Adrian Luckman, professor of geography at Swansea University. ""The circumstances may be a little particular, but this rapid retreat shows us what may happen elsewhere in Antarctica where glaciers are lightly grounded, and sea-ice loses its grip,"" he added. What makes this idea even more tantalising is that this process has never been observed in the modern world, the authors say. But suggest it may have triggered rapid ice loss into the ocean in the Earth's past. ""What we see at Hektoria is a small glacier, but if something like that were to happen in other areas of Antarctica, it could play a much larger role in the rate of sea-level rise,"" said Dr Ochwat. That could include Thwaites – the because it holds enough ice to raise global sea-levels by 65cm (26in) if it melted entirely. ""It's really important to understand whether or not there are other ice plain areas that would be susceptible to this kind of retreat and calving,"" Dr Ochwat added. But other researchers have contested the study's findings. The controversy surrounds the position of the ""grounding line"" or ""grounding zone"" - where the glacier loses contact with the seabed and starts to float in the ocean. ""This new study offers a tantalising glimpse into what could be the fastest rate of retreat ever observed in modern-day Antarctica,"" said Dr Frazer Christie, glaciologist and senior Earth observation specialist at Airbus Defence and Space. ""But there is significant disagreement within the glaciological community about the precise location of Hektoria Glacier's grounding line because it's so difficult to get accurate records from radar satellites in this fast-flowing region,"" he added. The location of the grounding line may sound trivial, but it is crucial to determine whether the change was truly unprecedented. ""If this section of the ice sheet was in fact floating [rather than resting on the seabed], the punchline would instead be that icebergs calved from an ice shelf, which is much less unusual behaviour,"" said Dr Christine Batchelor, senior lecturer in physical geography at Newcastle University. ""I think the mechanism and rate of retreat proposed are plausible in Antarctic ice plain settings, but because of uncertainty about where the grounding zone was located at Hektoria, I am not fully convinced that this has been observed here,"" she added. But where there is little debate is that the fragile white continent – once thought largely immune from the impacts of global warming – is now changing before our eyes. ""While we disagree about the process driving this change at Hektoria, we are in absolute agreement that the changes in the polar regions are scarily rapid, quicker than we expected even a decade ago,"" said Anna Hogg, professor of Earth observation at the University of Leeds. ""We must collect more data from satellites, so that we can better monitor and understand why these changes are occurring and what their implications are [for sea-level rise]."" to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

""That's the first time they've seen trees dance like that and the wind move like that,"" he told BBC News. ""They're in shock still, and traumatised. And can you imagine the children who are in the epicentre of it? It feels like you're in the Middle Ages."" Winds of up to 185mph (295 km/h) caused at least 28 deaths. Paul and his family were in the capital Kingston, while areas further west suffered the greatest damage. The singer said: ""It is really difficult to bear. We weren't hit in Kingston very hard, but it was frightening. And you're wondering, at any minute now is there going to be, you know, some tree that comes along and slaps your roof off? ""That happened to friends of mine in Montego Bay. They've lost their whole roof, and they're still in the trenches helping people there, making sure that food reaches and clothes reach [people]. Everybody's stuff is all muddied up and it's hard to think about something positive at this time.""

2025-11-03,At least 20 dead after magnitude-6.3 earthquake hits Afghanistan,science,BBC,"At least 20 people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, local authorities say, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Hundreds have also been left injured, local officials told the BBC. The earthquake struck near Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the country's largest cities that is home to about 500,000 people, at around 01:00 local time on Monday, (20:30 GMT on Sunday). It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17 miles), according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at the orange alert level, which indicates ""significant casualties"" are likely. More than 530 people have been injured, according to the Taliban government health ministry. Provincial officials earlier told the BBC that casualties were likely to rise as rescue efforts continued. Haji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province wrote earlier on X that ""many people are injured"" in the Sholgara district, south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received ""reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province"". ""Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,"" he wrote. Many of Mazar-e Sharif's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP news agency reported. The quake led to a power outage across the country including in the capital city Kabul, after electricity lines from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan - major suppliers of power to Afghanistan - were damaged. The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, revered by Shia Muslims. The mosque, built in the 15th Century, is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Mohamad. It is now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events. Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police are ""closely monitoring the situation"". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,100 people. That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake. Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Poor communication networks and infrastructure - buildings there are not earthquake-resistant, for example - have often hampered rescue efforts following disasters like this.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jrw12d3edo
2025-11-03,Sugarloaf selfies as William begins Brazil visit,science,BBC,"The Prince of Wales was presented with the keys to Rio de Janeiro as he began a five-day visit to Brazil. Prince William was on the city's Sugarloaf Mountain, with a bird's eye view of the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue, as he received the honour from the city's mayor, Eduardo Paes. The prince had travelled to the top of the mountain by cable car, to the surprise of several groups of tourists queuing to travel up the mountain. As he came down again, he posed for selfies with several of the people who had waited to catch a glimpse of him. He is visiting Brazil for the first time with two key environmental missions. On Wednesday he is presenting the Earthshot Prize, the annual award from the charity he set up himself. The following day he will travel to Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, where he is scheduled to deliver a speech as part of COP30, the annual UN climate meeting where governments discuss how to limit and prepare for further climate change. It is the first time that Prince William has travelled internationally for a COP summit, as his father, King Charles, has previously led the way for the royals, making several keynote speeches to world leaders over the years. Prince William did attend, along with his father, when it was held in Glasgow 2021, two weeks after the first Earthshot Prize. The prize annually awards a £1m grant in five different categories for projects that aim to repair the world's climate  - and Prince William has committed himself to it for10 years, with Rio marking a halfway point for the venture. includes an upcycled skyscraper in Sydney, the entire island of Barbados and a Bristol based company that filters microplastics from washing machines. When he announced the nominees, the prince spoke of the optimism and courage he was looking for. ""The people behind these projects are heroes of our time, so let us back them. Because, if we do, we can make the world cleaner, safer and full of opportunity - not only for future generations, but for the lives we want to lead now."" After the ceremony, Mayor Paes said Prince William has been ""amazed with the beauty of the city"" and he joked: ""So he's got the keys, he can do whatever he wants in the next 72 hours. The city belongs to Prince William. I'm still the king, but it will belong to him!"" Prince William's visit to Rio de Janeiro is the most significant royal engagement he will make this year and also mark the first time he will be seen representing the Royal Family since the crisis surrounding his uncle Andrew. There has been speculation that Prince William was heavily involved in the King's announcement last week to sanction Andrew by removing his remaining titles and asking him to leave his home in Windsor - but those close to the situation say that was not the case. Although William would have had a powerful, influential voice as the future monarch, the decision was ultimately the King's working with his private team of advisers and in conjunction with the government. The visit to Brazil will include the two key environment-based events but will also allow him to take in some of Rio's other famous sights. As an avid football fan and Patron of the English Football Association, it was no surprise that a pilgrimage was arranged on his first day to the Maracana Stadium, the stage of some of the football-mad nation's most famous moments. Once there, he was greeted by the player who wore the yellow and green kit more than any other, Brazil's most capped-star Cafu, who presented him with a signed number 2 Brazil shirt. The legendary right back, who is the , then joined Prince William in leading training drills involving local children. The royal, who had handily arrived wearing a smart pair of white trainers, did not need a second invitation to get out on one of the world's most famous football's pitches. One of the more unusual training techniques saw him playing in a game with a group of young girls in which all the players had to compete while carrying a cup of water - in order to improve their balance. And the prince then found himself under a peculiarly English pressure near the end of the session when he was required to take a penalty - a task that has seen many an Englishman fail in the biggest of tournament moments. But there were no worries for Prince William as he duly slotted his spot kick past 14-year-old goalkeeper Pedro Enrique and was then mobbed by his team-mates who all wanted a celebratory high-five. Young Pedro said he had been ""scared and nervous"" to be facing one of the most famous men in the world but said: ""I didn't let him score. It was a good penalty."" And the sporting activity did not stop there - Prince William later went to Copacabana Beach, where he played beach volleyball with Brazil international Carolina Solberg.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylxv52pdeo

2025-11-04,AI used to spot weeds growing in farmers' fields,science,BBC,"A research centre has been trialling using artificial intelligence (AI) to spot weeds in farmers' fields using cameras fitted to crop sprayers. Rothamsted Research, based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, said the cameras could detect the weed black-grass at a range of growth stages using AI. The system then ensures the correct amount of herbicide is sprayed onto that area of the field. Dr David Comont, an evolutionary ecologist at Rothamsted Research, said the project has brought ""the knowledge we have acquired over many years of studying the black-grass problem"" and combined it with state-of the art technology. ""By targeting herbicides only where they are needed, we can both reduce the amount of herbicide being used and the cost to the grower, while still maintaining control of this weed,"" he added. Rothamsted Research helped to train the cameras to spot black-grass by photographing both the crop and weed plants from a fixed height. An AI algorithm was then trained to apply this knowledge to images that came from cameras being driven over real fields across a whole farm, the research group said. The camera asks the sprayer to target an area where it can see black-grass is growing so the technique is in effect map-based rather than targeting individual plants. Experiments with a sprayer using different numbers of cameras and boom heights resulted in a working set up of 28 cameras set at a height of 1.1m (3.2ft). The three-year project involved taking thousands of images in the field and mapping the black-grass infestation across more than 100 hectares (247 acres). Muhammad Kassem, a data scientist at Bosch, said: ""Overall we've scanned around 5,000 images and they cover a variety of different seasons and where black-grass is growing amongst different crops, not only wheat but also barley and beans. ""Each time the sprayer ran through the field we had so many images that it took a couple of days to download them all. ""Then we used coding to clean these up and then to train the AI. We've come out of it with really good accuracy of around 85%,"" he said. Funding for the project came from the Department for Food, Agriculture and Rural Affair's and the UK Research and Innovation's",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwypv8zym4ro
2025-11-04,First scientific evidence of Black Death in Edinburgh found on skeleton,science,BBC,"The first scientific evidence of the Black Death in Edinburgh has been discovered on the remains of a teenage boy who died in the 14th Century. Plaque on the child's teeth has been found to contain pathogens of the bacteria for the Bubonic plague. Originally excavated in 1981 from the grounds of St Giles' Cathedral, the remains have undergone new detailed analysis using advanced methods including ancient DNA sequencing, isotopic analysis and radiocarbon dating. John Lawson, City of Edinburgh Council's curator of archaeology, said it was a ""very exciting"" discovery. Mr Lawson said the young male was buried with care, rather than in a mass grave which was more common for victims at the time. The skeleton, which dates from between 1300 and 1370 - a period coinciding with the Black Death - was one of 115 exhumed almost 45 years ago to make way for steps inside the cathedral on the Royal Mile. They have been stored in the city's archives since then. The new work on the medieval bodies was commissioned as part of Edinburgh 900,  a year-long celebration of the city's 900th anniversary. The cathedral, which was founded in 1124, has also been marking the milestone. Although the work has not been finished, Mr Lawson has spoken to BBC Scotland News about the discovery. He commissioned experts at the Francis Crick Institute in London to do the DNA tests. ""This teenager has the ancient DNA of the bacteria of the Black Death, of the Bubonic plague, which is really exciting,"" Mr Lawson said. The disease, which would not show up on the bones, could only be identified using modern DNA testing. Mr Lawson said: ""We know the Black Death happened but it is the fact we can now tie this person into historic events that is very exciting."" The Black Death pandemic was primarily caused by bubonic plague. Bubonic plague is the most common type of plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, characterised by swollen lymph nodes called ""buboes"". The name ""Black Death"" likely arose because of the skin lesions and tissue death (gangrene) that turned the skin black in some cases. The Black Death was a specific historical pandemic that swept through Europe between 1347 and 1353. It was one of the most fatal pandemics in history, wiping out an estimated 50 million people in Europe. Five layers of bodies were found in the cathedral's grounds - each covering about 100 years. Mr Lawson said the discovery meant a better picture could be painted of this historical period in time. ""Without this ancient DNA we wouldn't have known how this person died and, by examining all the cemeteries in a proper scientific way, it's going to be ground changing in terms of how we understand and chart our history,"" he added. The project has previously used pioneering technology by experts at Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee universities, to create facial restorations of a number of the skeletons. Dr Maria Maclennan, a senior lecturer at the School of Design, Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) at Edinburgh University, led the work on facial restorations. Among them was a man buried within the grounds of the cathedral in the 12th Century and a woman who was one of eight females buried inside the Chapel of Our Lady between the 15th and 16th Centuries. Two 15th Century pilgrims have also been studied. The faces of five of them are currently on show at St Giles' in the exhibition Edinburgh's First Burghers: Revealing the Lives and Hidden Faces of Edinburgh's Medieval Citizens, which runs until 30 November. Mr Lawson said the pioneering work had even ascertained where the people, who were buried between the 12th Century and 1560, were born. Tests have given an ""amazing"" insight into the lives, diets, health, origins, and identities of Edinburgh's earliest residents, he said. Although more will be revealed once the project has been completed, Mr Lawson told BBC Scotland trace chemicals in the geology of water they drank was used to map where they were born. He said early research shows most of the people were from the Lothians with one or two from the Scottish Highlands. Margaret Graham, City of Edinburgh Council's culture and communities convener  said: ""Thanks to this exciting new research, we've been able to get a closer insight into the lives of those who existed through such a notable chapter in our past. ""As an ancient city, we have such a rich history and the discovery of a young male who may have died during the Black Death is a hugely significant find. ""I've no doubt that we have so much left to uncover and our heritage and shared stories will be enhanced over time.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kpz2vnqglo
2025-11-04,Stone tool discovery suggests very first humans were inventors,science,BBC,"The very first humans millions of years ago may have been inventors, according to a discovery in northwest Kenya. Researchers have found that the primitive humans who lived 2.75 million years ago at an archaeological site called Namorotukunan used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years. Evidence previously suggested that early human tool use was sporadic: randomly developed and quickly forgotten. The Namorotukunan find is the first to show that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations. According to Prof David Braun, of George Washington University, in Washington DC, who led the research, this find, , provides incredibly strong evidence for a radical shake-up in our understanding of human evolution. ""We thought that tool use could have been a flash in the pan and then disappeared. When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,"" he said. ""This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was."" Archaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method. The same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil. ""What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,"" he told BBC News. ""These  guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them."" Geological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate. The landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,"" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya. These sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away.  But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. ""Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food."" The evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them. And this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. ""Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants."" There is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance. ""The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier. ""They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food."" At around 2.75 million years ago, the region was populated by some of the very first humans, who had relatively small brains. These early humans are thought to have lived alongside their evolutionary ancestors: a pre-human group, called australopithecines, who had larger teeth and a mix of chimpanzee and human traits. The tool users at Namorotukunan were most likely one of these groups or possibly both. And the finding challenges the notion held by many experts in human evolution that continuous tool use emerged much later, between 2.4 and 2.2 million years ago, when humans had evolved relatively larger brains, according to Prof Braun. ""The argument is that we're looking at a pretty substantial brain size increase. And so, often the assertion has been that tool use allowed them to feed this large brain. ""But what we're seeing at Namorotukunan is that these really early tools are used before that brain size increase."" ""We have probably vastly underestimated these early humans and human ancestors. We can actually trace the roots of our ability to adapt to change by using technology much earlier than we thought, all the way to 2.75 million years ago, and probably much earlier.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zn4ln85ro

2025-11-02,Your questions answered on the long delayed north-south power project,science,BBC,"It is one of Northern Ireland's biggest infrastructure projects – and one of its most delayed. , the north-south interconnector is now not expected to be completed until 2031. The €350m (£308m) scheme has been endorsed by successive infrastructure ministers, including the current officeholder, Liz Kimmons. Depending on who you ask, it's either a key chance to meet Northern Ireland's climate change targets and deliver energy security, or a threat to pristine countryside and rural communities. At its simplest, it is a set of high voltage power lines intended to carry massive amounts of electricity across the border. Most of the fuss is over where it will be built, and how. The project received planning permission to run these high voltage cables overhead on large pylons along a 138km route from Turleenan in County Tyrone to Woodland in County Meath. SONI operates the electricity grid in Northern Ireland. Owned by the Republic of Ireland's grid operator, Eirgrid, it has been one of the driving forces in the scheme's development. It says that the project is vital to energy security, will lower consumers' bills and help meet green energy targets. Currently about 43% of the electricity Northern Ireland uses comes from renewable sources, like wind and solar. But Stormont's 2022 Climate Change Act sets a legallybinding target of 80% to be achieved by 2030. Energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight estimates that delays to the interconnector will see the level of electricity from renewable sources fall to 35% by 2030. Northern Ireland is part of the Single Electricity Market (SEM), along with the Republic of Ireland. It was set up in 2007 in the hope that competition in the wholesale energy market would drive lower prices for consumers. All electricity used in Northern Ireland or the Republic is bought and sold through that central market. But for the market to work efficiently, power needs to be able to be get from one part of the network to another. Today, that isn't always possible. SONI says the inadequacy of the current interconnector at the border means power can't always be moved in the quantities required. Flow across that interconnector has to be constrained to ensure that the line won't fail, something which could cause blackouts. This constraint creates inefficiencies that SONI claims cost Northern Ireland consumers about £19m a year. Electricity has a storage problem. Batteries are great for the relatively small amounts of electricity needed for phones or even cars, but the huge amounts of electricity required to power entire neighbourhoods and factories are another story. The technology to store that power is still in its early stages, and the facilities required don't currently exist in Northern Ireland. And it can't just go into the system. Electricity oversupply causes problems for the grid and the machines that run on it. So the supply of electricity needs to match demand at all times, but sometimes that creates waste. Imagine a windy night on rural part of the north Antrim cost. In those conditions, turbines should be whirring, generating enough electricity to power thousands of homes. But it's night-time and there aren't enough houses or factories nearby to use up that power. So since it can't be stored and to prevent an overload, the grid operator will essentially tell the turbine owner to avoid generating electricity by shutting down or pointing some turbines in the wrong direction. A chance to generate clean energy is wasted. Grid operators call this dispatching down. in Northern Ireland since 2022. Cornwall Insight estimates that almost 30% of wind energy generated in Northern Ireland goes unused due to restrictions in the power grid. Proponents of the interconnector say it would help solve this problem. If energy generated by those wind turbines could be sent where it is needed, a greater portion of our total electricity use would come from domestic renewables – rather than more expensive energy imports. So it would not only be a boost to energy security, but a potential route to lower consumer electricity bills. Some of those living near the proposed route More than 100 new pylons will have to be built along the interconnector's route in Northern Ireland, with six of those pylons already under construction. Kevin Redmond lives near one of those pylons. ""You have those towering pylons in such a beautiful rural idyllic setting. It will be absolutely destroyed by that, there's no question."" He says there was a lack of consultation, and that he only became aware a pylon was actually going to be built on the day work began. ""I was never consulted, it's disappointing. You'd think with something as significant as what I have behind me you'd get a letter or somebody might appear."" - launched a fresh legal challenge against the project last week. He says the scheme will give greater benefits to a growing and than to consumers north of the border, where energy consumption has been slowly decreasing in recent years. ""Meta, Apple and Google can pay any price to keep their data centres running. Why should a person on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road be bidding for their electricity against that?"" Mr Woods says he fears that the project, particularly the construction of so many large pylons, will harm rural communities. At an early stage, the project considered putting its high voltage cables underground. Although this is a less objectionable option to opponents, a number of studies have determined that SONI says undergrounding is ""technically very challenging and exponentially more costly than the standard overhead line which has received full approval from planning authorities.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqll413q28o

2025-11-02,Devastation on repeat: How climate change is worsening Pakistan's deadly floods,science,BBC,"Rescuers and relatives searched knee-deep in water for the body of one-year-old Zara. She'd been swept away by flash floods; the bodies of her parents and three siblings had already been found days earlier. ""We suddenly saw a lot of water. I climbed up to the roof and urged them to join me,"" Arshad, Zara's grandfather, said, showing the BBC the dirt road where they were taken from him in the village of Sambrial in northern Punjab in August. His family tried to join him, but too late. The powerful current washed away all six of them. Every year, monsoon season brings deadly floods in Pakistan. This year it began in late June, and within three months, floods had killed more than 1,000 people. At least 6.9  million were affected, according to the United Nations  agency for humanitarian affairs, OCHA. The South Asian nation is struggling with the devastating consequences of climate change, despite emitting just 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To witness its effects, the BBC travelled from the mountains of the north to the plains of the south for three months. In every province, climate change was having a different impact. There was one element in common, though. The poorest suffer most. We met people who'd lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones – and they were resigned to going through it all again in the next monsoon. Monsoon floods started in the north, with global warming playing out in its most familiar form in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan. Amid the high peaks of the Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush, there are more than 7,000 glaciers. But due to rising temperatures, they are melting. The result can be catastrophic: meltwater turns into glacial lakes which can suddenly burst. Thousands of villages are at risk. This summer hundreds of homes were destroyed and roads damaged by landslides and flash floods. These ""glacial lake outbursts"" are hard to warn against. The area is remote and mobile service poor. Pakistan and the World Bank are trying to improve an early warning system, which often doesn't work because of the mountainous terrain. Community is a powerful asset. When shepherd Wasit Khan woke up to rushing waters, with trailing chunks of ice and debris, he ran to an area with a better signal. He began warning as many villagers as he could. ""I told everyone to leave their belongings, leave the house, take their wives, children and elderly people and get away,"" he told BBC Urdu's Muhammad Zubair. Thanks to him, dozens were saved. The danger took a different form in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In Gadoon, the BBC found hundreds of villagers digging through piles of rocks with their bare hands. A cloudburst had caused a flash flood early in the morning, a local official said. That happens when a sudden updraft in humid, moist air leads to a heavy and localised burst of rain. The current washed away several homes and triggered a landslide. Men from neighbouring villages rushed over to help, which was invaluable – but not enough. The excavators the villagers desperately needed were trapped in flooded roads, some blocked by massive rocks. ""Nothing will happen until the machines arrive,"" one man told the BBC. Then a silence suddenly blanketed the area. Dozens of men stood still in one corner. The bodies of two children, soaked in dark mud, were pulled from under the rubble, and carried away. Scenes like this played out across the province, with rescuers delayed due to uprooted trees and major infrastructure being destroyed. A helicopter carrying aid crashed in the bad weather, claiming the lives of all crew on board. In villages and cities, millions have settled around rivers and streams, areas prone to flooding. Pakistan's River Protection Act - which prohibits building within 200 ft (61m) of a river or its tributaries - was meant to solve that issue. But for many it's simply too costly to settle elsewhere. Illegal construction makes matters worse. Climate scientist Fahad Saeed blames this on local corruption and believes officials are failing to enforce the law. He spoke to the BBC in Islamabad, next to a half-built, four-storey concrete building as big as a car park - and right by a stream that he saw flood this summer, killing a child. ""Just a few kilometres from parliament and still such things happen in Pakistan,"" he says, visibly frustrated. ""It's because of misgovernance, the role of the government is to be a watchdog."" Former climate minister Senator Sherry Rehman, who chairs the climate committee in Pakistan's Senate, calls it ""graft"", or simply ""looking the other way"" when permissions are given for construction in vulnerable areas. By late August, further south in the province of Punjab, floods had submerged 4,500 villages, overwhelming ""Pakistan's breadbasket"", in a country that can't always afford to import enough food. For the first time, three rivers - the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab - flooded simultaneously, triggering the largest rescue operation in decades. ""It was the most important anomaly,"" said Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah, the chief risk officer for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). In Punjab's capital, Lahore, the impact on wealthier and poorer communities was stark. The gated community of Park View City was inundated by the Ravi river, making its prized streets impossible to navigate. Residents of luxury homes were forced to evacuate. Surveying the damage, two local men, Abdullah and his father Gulraiz, were convinced water would be drained soon, thanks to the area's property developer Aleem Khan, a federal minister. ""No problem, Aleem Khan will do it,"" Gulraiz told the BBC. But for residents in the poorer neighbourhood of Theme Park, the floods were crushing. One officer told the BBC they kept having to rescue people who swam back to their homes when the water levels dropped, desperate to salvage whatever they could. But then the water would rise, leaving them stranded. We saw one man returning from his house, an inflatable donut resting on his hip. Some residents were moved to tents provided by the Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan. Sitting outside in the summer heat, Sumera was weeks away from giving birth. She was extremely thin. ""My doctor says I need two blood transfusions this week,"" she said as she tried to keep hold of her toddler, Arsh. Nearby, Ali Ahmad was balancing a small kitten he rescued from the floods on his shoulder. The boy was one of the few who had a mattress to sleep on. By the end of monsoon season, the floods had displaced more than 2.7 million people in Punjab, the UN said, and damaged more than one million hectares of farmland. Further south in Multan district, always hit hard by floods, the scale of the humanitarian crisis became even clearer, with tents lining dirt roads and highways. Access to healthcare was already a challenge in rural areas of Pakistan, but once the floods hit, the challenge was unbearable for many women we met. BBC Urdu's Tarhub Asghar met two sisters-in-law, both nine months pregnant. A doctor had warned them they weren't drinking enough water. They raised a bottle to explain. The water was completely brown. Some are trying different solutions. Architect Yasmeen Lari has designed what she calls ""climate-resilient houses"" in dozens of villages. In Pono, near Hyderabad, women showed the BBC huts they'd built themselves - a large circular building on wooden stilts. Dr Lari calls it their training centre and says families can move their belongings there and shelter. But Dr Lari argues building an entire village on stilts would be unfeasible and too expensive. Instead, she says her designs ensure the roofs don't collapse, and that by using natural materials such as bamboo and lime concrete, the homes can be rebuilt quickly by the villagers themselves. Pakistan has reached a point where ""it's not about saving buildings; it's about saving lives,"" she says. This is the reality for Pakistan. All the climate scientists and politicians the BBC spoke to warn of an increasingly worrying future. ""Every year the monsoon will become more and more aggressive,"" Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah at the NDMA said. ""Every year, there will be a new surprise for us."" As the country faces the growing and ever-changing challenges posed by climate change, in which the poorest are often the worst affected, there is one refrain from people returning to homes likely to flood next year: ""I have nowhere else to go.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmx2e3nnw0o

Harvest mouse project manager Sarah Butcher said the children found 17 nests during their hunt which was the most she had found this year. Ms Butcher said: ""Nests are nice and easy to find in comparison to the mice. ""Altogether we found 17 nests which is a record not just for this site but it's the most I've found this year.""

The charity said the survey would be used to build awareness of the importance of the harvest mouse and encourage volunteers to get involved. It said surveying the nests in the winter would not disturb the harvest mice because they were no longer occupied. Afrika Priestley, the charity's data and research officer, said every record submitted  helped build a clearer picture of harvest mouse distribution and the habitats they relied on, which was ""vital"" for their conservation. Farmer Joe Clarke, who owns the fields at Mothecombe, said getting people on the farm helped them learn about how agriculture interacted and mixed with wildlife.

Commenting on this year's ceremony, which will be held in Brazil on Wednesday and see five finalists awarded £1m, Matter's Anthony Kolanko said: ""It's a bit like winning an Olympic gold medal in environmental entrepreneurship."" He added: ""To get that recognition from peers is fantastic for the business, but also just to shine a spotlight on the problem as a whole is a great thing."" and looks at solutions to issues from different countries and sectors, with Matter nominated in the Revive Our Oceans category. Matter's head office is in Bristol and the business started off building filters for household washing machines, but has since raised more than £15m for its work and employs about 45 people. Microplastics are extremely small pieces of debris in our environment created from the disposal and breakdown of consumer products and industrial waste. Mr Kolanko, who is the company's chief revenue officer, said microplastics are polluting our oceans and can be found in our drinking water, which is harmful for our bodies. ""We're now finding this pollutant in our blood, in our organs, even our breast milk, and it's causing real harm,"" he added. ""So if we can capture it at [the] source, hopefully we can get a better, healthier environment."" Unlike traditional filters, Matter's filter system is self-cleaning and is already being used domestically for washing machines. Matter was set up by engineer Adam Root, who recently told the BBC his invention was created at The filter can be attached to the back of a machine and catch the escaping debris pieces by using a water blade extracting the microplastics.

2025-11-03,Pumping station and WW2 pillbox converted for bats,science,BBC,"A former pumping station and a World War Two pillbox have been converted into accommodation for bats in two separate projects. The old Bournemouth Water facility in Ferndown, Dorset, has been decked out with bat-friendly features including special tiles, bat boxes, baffles and a dormer fly-in entrance. The wartime bunker in Christchurch has been transformed by blocking up windows and installing a grille to protect bats from disturbance. The projects, by Bournemouth Water and South West Water and by Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council (BCP), aim to address habitat loss for the elusive mammals. The conversion of the redundant 1980s pump building near Longham Lakes was completed in April and recent surveys confirmed its first residents - soprano pipistrelle bats - had moved in. The roost is designed for summer and winter use, with cool underground chambers for hibernation and warmer loft spaces and boxes for maternity colonies. Paul McNie, South West Water's Sampling and Environmental Manager, said: ""We like to think of this as a kind of bat house renovation project. ""The old building was no longer serving its original purpose and was deteriorating, making it unsafe, so we've reimagined it as a safe space for wildlife."" The pillbox in Mudeford Wood once helped defend RAF Christchurch but, like the pumping station, has been transformed into a dedicated bat habitat, known as a hibernaculum. The area - a designated Site of Nature Conservation Interest - is already home to common pipistrelle, brown long-eared, and serotine bats. The project was financed by Heathland Mitigation Funding, paid by developers building near protected heathlands. BCP's climate response councillor Andy Hadley said the pillbox was at risk of being ""lost to the community due to anti-social behaviour"". ""It's wonderful to see it given a new purpose - supporting our native wildlife whilst celebrating the site's fascinating history,"" he said. Local bat ecologist Colin Morris said: ""Once the word gets around in the batty world, it's likely to become a regular, long-term, safe and secure haven for them during the important hibernation period.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pn73e19po
2025-11-03,"Hospital performs 10,000th robotic surgery",science,BBC,"A hospital in Surrey has performed its 10,000th robotic-assisted surgical procedure. Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust first introduced the technology in 2009 with the installation of a da Vinci surgical system. It now operates four surgical robots across a range of specialities, including urology, gynaecology, colorectal, hepatobiliary, oesophagogastric and ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery. The 10,000th patient was Alistair Hutchinson, 49, who underwent robotic surgery for throat cancer. He said: ""It truly changed everything. I was able to receive the treatment I needed to remove the cancer – without facing the harsh side effects I had feared."" The Royal Surrey is the country's fourth largest cancer centre, treating more than 8,000 patients each year across the South East of England. It delivers 4,000 chemotherapy treatments, almost 3,500 sessions of radiotherapy, and over 2,000 cancer surgeries annually. The Trust performed just three robotic surgeries in the first year but said the  programme has grown into one of the busiest and most advanced in the country. In 2024, more than 1,500 patients benefitted from robotic surgery, with the Trust saying it performed more prostate surgeries than any other single-site hospital in the UK. Consultant Ear Nose and Throat surgeon David Walker said: ""For many years we've been ahead of the curve in terms of driving better technologies for patients  and we know that this creates better outcomes."" The robot does not replace surgeons but enhances their ability to carry out complex operations via very tiny incisions, with greater accuracy and precision. The surgeon operates the robot from a control console, performing the procedure using a minimally invasive approach, also known as keyhole surgery. Patients benefit from faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, better outcomes and less complications while it also helps the hospital improve efficiency and save bed days. Mr Hutchinson said: ""Because the throat is such a sensitive area, I was deeply concerned about the potential long-term side effects. ""My children are only seven and five, and I was worried about how the treatment might affect not just me, but them too. Then I found out robotic surgery was an option."" Tim Pencavel, consultant surgeon and joint chief of service for surgery at the Royal Surrey Hospital said the majority of robotic surgeries are for cancer patients. ""Our catchment area for cancer effectively is the western side of the Kent, Surrey and Sussex region. ""Because of that volume of patients, it goes back to needing to help people more efficiently so that we can get more of those people through our doors."" The NHS believes millions of patients will benefit from cutting-edge robotic surgery over the next decade as part of its plans to cut waiting times. It said half a million operations will be supported by the approach every year by 2035, up from 70,000 in 2023/24, according to NHS projections. Nine in 10 of all keyhole surgeries, such as the removal of certain organs affected by cancer, will be delivered with robot assistance within the next 10 years, up from 1 in 5 today with robotic surgery being the default for many operations. The NHS also expects to see increasing numbers of emergency operations using the technology. or WhatsApp us on 08081 002250.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v8176z7dlo
2025-11-02,New countryside site opens to protect heathlands,science,BBC,"A new countryside site has opened in Dorset in an attempt to protect important heathlands. The Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace, located just outside Bere Regis and near the A35, has been funded by contributions from developers collected by Dorset Council. It is part of Wild Woodbury, Dorset Wildlife Trust's pioneering rewilding initiative covering 170 hectares and making it England's first large-scale community rewilding project. Dorset Council said it was a ""brilliant example of how we can balance nature recovery with public access"". The space features car parking, dog waste bins and walking paths that meander through open glades and emerging woodland. While the area is currently grassland, it is being allowed to gently return to its natural state with minimal intervention, while maintaining walking paths. A food forest is being planted with fruiting trees and bushes, and a large community table will provide a space for people to gather, share and learn. Bere Regis Primary School and local residents have played a central role in shaping the design of the space, ensuring it reflects the needs and aspirations of the village. Dorset Council leader Nick Ireland said: ""It provides an alternative recreational area that helps protect nearby heathland, home to many of Dorset's most treasured wildlife species. ""Funding collected from developers when new homes or buildings are constructed, has enabled the creation of this valuable green space for the community. ""This is a great demonstration of how development and conservation can work together.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6200w9deg2o
2025-11-03,Borders town braces for first winter test of new flood protections,science,BBC,"The Hawick flood protection scheme is one of the biggest ever completed in Scotland. With a price tag last reported at £92m it has seen a huge infrastructure investment in the Borders. Work on the main contract started in July 2020 and took about five years in total. Now it is set to face the first real test of its capabilities as it prepares for the worst of what a Scottish winter can throw at it. So how confident are locals and those behind it that it will prevent the scenes so often witnessed in the town before? Joan Hamilton and her husband Ronnie have lived near the town's rugby club - near the River Teviot - for more than 40 years. Their home has been regularly affected - but the worst incident was 20 years ago. ""It was really flooded out in 2005, I mean, the water was up to past our knees and it was really bad,"" Joan said. ""It had an impact on my husband's health, for a start, and we had to get out of the house for more than six months. ""We were put up in the hotel for the first week, and then we were allocated a little house up in Burnfoot for the rest of the six months."" She said she had got used to living with the threat but her husband found it more difficult to cope with and the defences were very welcome. ""It's made a big difference to our life,"" she said. ""We're not always on edge thinking what's going to happen. ""It's been a big job but it's been worth it for us."" Project director Conor Price has spent the past 16 years working on defences for Galashiels, Selkirk and his largest to date in Hawick. He said that although a lot of other elements had been incorporated into the project it remained, first and foremost, a flood protection scheme. ""It was conceived as a project to reduce the flood risk in the town of Hawick because of the enormous flood risk that it has had over many centuries,"" he said. ""In the end, it is still a flood protection scheme."" However, he said the opportunity to add other benefits - by improving pathways and active travel - had come along during the ""design journey"". Mr Price said working in such a historic town presented a number of difficulties but two areas had proved particularly testing. The second was at Commercial Road where a section of trunk road needed to be replaced and public utilities moved which had to be carried out before the main work could begin. He said that, from his point of view, local people had been ""extremely patient"". ""The people of the town understood the scale of flood risk,"" he said. ""They desired a flood protection scheme. They knew that the future of the town required one. ""And from my perspective, they have been absolutely fantastic."" He said he hoped that the scheme could give them some peace of mind and cut out ""sleepless nights"" when the river rises. ""What I can tell you is that with the defences that are in place today, that every flood that has ever been recorded in Hawick would have been able to safely travel through those defences if those defences had been in place in the past,"" he added. He knows they will face a ""robust test"" in future and that the council will need to ""remain vigilant"" to ensure they are managed, maintained and repaired so they are always ready for use. The project has already picked up a number of awards for its engineering and construction but the biggest ambition is to take away the scenes witnessed in years gone by. Stuart Marshall is a local councillor and chairs the Hawick Flood Group. ""I think the mood in the community now is one of relief,"" he said. ""For the first year, I think, since 2005, the Hawick residents will be able to sleep easy in their beds without being worrying about flooding. ""It's something that's plagued our town for many, many years."" He said people had ""every right"" to question the cost but the investment meant everyone in the community could feel ""much safer"". A final price tag is expected to be revealed soon but is likely to exceed £100m. He said the memories of one of the worst incidents - in October 2005 - were fresh in his mind and seeing people who had lost the entire contents of their home or business. ""Seeing the grief on their faces - that'll stay with me forever,"" he said. He too, is awaiting the scheme's first big test. ""I think there'll be a degree of nervousness,"" he admitted. The flood group will still stand ready as they await the first ""big waters"" to see how the protection system behaves. ""All eyes will be on Hawick when the weather closes in and the river levels start to rise,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xy0eq593o
2025-11-03,Hedgerows and mob grazing: Can farming fix its carbon black hole?,science,BBC,"Johnnie Balfour farms a 300-strong herd of Aberdeen Angus - and is planning to expand operations. Cattle are notoriously the most planet-warming, methane-emitting of all the farmed animals. But Johnnie's business, near Glenrothes in Fife, is rated as carbon negative – which means it removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits. His grazing is efficient and emissions from the livestock are offset by trees, soils and grass on the land. Unusually, Johnnie's herd lives outdoors all-year-round through a process called mob grazing - where the cattle are shifted onto a fresh piece of grass every day. He insists livestock should not be viewed as the problem for the environment, and that more focus should be placed on how farms as a whole are managed. He said: ""In our old system the cattle would have been spending quite a lot of time in the shed. When they're in the shed they would have been eating some silage, barley and beans which would have been grown here."" However, growing that feed would have involved sprays, fertiliser and ""a lot of machinery"". These all have some kind of carbon footprint, but have now been cut from the process. He believes cutting livestock numbers is too simplistic a way of tackling emissions in agriculture. ""It's not the cow, it's the how. We need to manage our cattle better,"" he said. Johnnie's Aberdeen Angus cows are smaller than some of the continental breeds which can have a harsher impact on the land. But his farming method demonstrates one way the Scottish government would like the land use sector to be operating by 2045. Ministers have pledged to reach net zero - the point where we're adding no more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere – by that date. This is achieved mostly by cutting emissions. Those which remain are then offset through a combination of natural and engineered processes. After repeatedly missing its annual targets, the Scottish government scrapped the measure last year in favour of five-yearly carbon budgets. In the coming days, we expect to find out what Scotland plans to do to play its part in limiting global warming. However, ministers have already blown a huge hole in how that can be achieved. This summer, First Minister John Swinney promised farmers at the Royal Highland Show that they would not have to reduce livestock numbers. That was quite the crowd pleaser on the day - but the policy comes with significant ramifications. It goes against advice from the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC), which suggested cutting livestock by 26% by 2035. , suggests annual emissions from agriculture should drop from 7.6 million tonnes in 2025 to 5.1 million by 2035. The measures being suggested to reduce emissions include decarbonising machinery such as tractors and cutting fertiliser use. The CCC report says 48% of that 2.5 million tonne cut in emissions should come from reducing livestock numbers. That leaves a gap equal to about 1.2 million tonnes of planet-warming carbon dioxide by 2035. Livestock numbers have been declining and are expected to fall further - but not at the rate needed to meet the CCC's targets. This is only one pathway towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2045, and the Scottish government does not have to follow the advice given to it by the CCC. Planting more trees is one way to offset emissions. The CCC's suggested route to net-zero proposed increasing forestry cover from 19% of the land at present to 21% by 2035. Part of the committee's reasoning for reducing livestock numbers was to free up the land to create the new forests. The government will need to identify where any additional trees can be planted. However, tree planting has really stalled in recent years, with Scotland falling well short of its annual targets. One nursery owner last year threatened to burn millions of young saplings after nature restoration budgets for tree planting were plundered to fund local authority pay rises. There were warnings that disrupting growth in the tree planting sector for a short-term financial fix would set the industry back by years. In September, the company Christies of Fochabers went into administration. So ramping up afforestation – or tree planting - will not be an easy task. One little-spoken-of alternative to tree planting involves extending the amount of hedgerows in Scotland's countryside. There are currently about 43,000km of managed and unmanaged hedgerows. The CCC proposes adding another 5,000km by 2035 and then 4,000km more in the following decade. Denise Walton is a big advocate for the benefits hedgerows can bring to the land. In recent years, she has added 11km to her farm in Berwickshire. The holly, blackthorn, hazel and other native species provide corridors for wildlife as well as absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. ""On the canopy, on the top, you've got this wonderful foliage and then beneath the ground - what we can't see - you've got a really impressive, intricate web of root mass which, working with the soil, is really what's sequestering the carbon,"" she said. But when it comes to the amount of carbon which can be absorbed by hedgerows, the numbers aren't great. A study by Leeds University in 2022 found that increasing hedgerows by 40% would offset just 2.8% of England's agricultural emissions. Combined with agroforestry - where livestock is housed in fields where trees are planted - the Climate Change Committee concludes that the total offsetting potential in Scotland is 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That's well short of the 1.2 million tonne shortfall Scottish ministers have created for themselves. What other options are available to the government? In the short term, it could look to areas outside agriculture and land use to speed up emissions cuts. Accelerating the rollout of electric vehicles would help. Domestic transport is the biggest single source of Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for almost 29%. Agriculture ranks third, with just under 19%. The current presumption is that 60% of cars on Scotland's roads will be electric by 2035. However, most of the levers for achieving that sit with the UK government – so a speedier transition just in Scotland therefore would seem unlikely. More engineered removals would also help plug the gap. That would involve mechanically sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and burying it underground. This technology is in its infancy and is really designed for offsetting areas such as aviation, where emissions cuts are difficult. Ministers have caused themselves a predicament but the targets for cutting planet warming emissions are legally binding and they need to set out how they will achieve them. The Climate Change Committee has previously been critical of plans which are vague on policies and light on detail. So the government's plan will have to be very specific about what needs to be achieved - and how.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75q0dr2w09o
2025-11-01,City unveils award-winning rainforest garden,science,BBC,"An award-winning rainforest display which featured in this year's Chelsea Flower Show has officially opened at a zoo. The rare biodiverse habitat at Bristol Zoo Project will be used as an educational space and is part of a 100-year scheme to restore Britain's temperate rainforests. The Wildlife Trust display includes native plants that, according to the zoo, once covered the distance of Cornwall to the west of Scotland, but now cover less than 1% of the UK. Award-winning garden designer Zoe Claymore said it was exciting to know the garden would help to safeguard these rainforests for the future. ""Seeing the British Rainforest Garden find a permanent home at Bristol Zoo Project feels incredibly special,"" she added. The rainforest display was a winner of the RHS People's Choice Award at this year's Chelsea Flower Show.

Bristol Zoo Project said this would be the first time a rainforest landscape would be based in the city. The zoo's director of conservation and science, Brian Zimmerman, said he wanted the space to offer learning opportunities for visitors. ""They [Britain's rainforests] existed here for millions of years and unfortunately most of them were cut down many centuries ago,"" he explained. ""The fact that we're bringing one back to life here on the site in Bristol Zoo project is really exciting for us to be able to have that space to do the teaching.""

2025-10-31,Just Stop Oil trio cleared over Stonehenge protest,science,BBC,"Three Just Stop Oil activists who sprayed Stonehenge with orange powder have been cleared of causing a public nuisance. Rajan Naidu, 74, Oxford University student Niamh Lynch, 23, and Luke Watson, 36, were acquitted following a They had denied all charges of damaging an ancient protected monument and causing a public nuisance, after as part of an ongoing fossil fuel protest by the direct action group. The trio accepted taking part in the protest and cited in their defence ""reasonable excuse"" and their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights to freedom of speech and freedom to protest. Mr Naidu from Birmingham, Ms Lynch from Bedford and Mr Watson from Essex, had been accused of using two colour blasters filled with cornflour, talc and an orange dye to spray the monument in a The court was told the trio targeted Stonehenge the day before last year's summer solstice where around 15,000 people were due to gather and celebrate. Mr Watson had bought the equipment used in the attack and had to drive the co-accused to Stonehenge that morning. After the attack, both Mr Naidu and Ms Lynch sat in silence in front of the stones, where they were then arrested by police. The powder was promptly cleaned from the stones at a cost of £620. The defendants argued that it was a ""peaceful protest"", that the rights of others were not ""greatly interfered with"", that care had been taken in choosing the type of powder to use. There was no lasting damage to the stones and they argued that protesting about fossil fuels was a legitimate cause. Simon Jones prosecuting alleged the protest, which was filmed by other Just Stop Oil supporters, had been ""carefully planned"" and it was ""an act of blatant and clear vandalism"". Giving his legal directions to the jury, Judge Paul Dugdale said they had to determine whether a conviction would be a ""proportionate interference"" with the protestors rights and said ""everyone's entitled to express their own opinion"" even if we disagree. ""If individuals disagree with what our Government is doing on certain matters they are entitled to protest about the Government's actions or inactions,"" he said. ""There are times when protecting the right to freedom of speech and freedom to protest can mean that activity that would otherwise be unlawful would be regarded as lawful by the court to protect those rights,"" he added. After the jury, which took six hours to deliberate, returned its verdict the trio hugged each other in the dock. Representing the protestors, solicitor Francesca Cociani, from law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said her clients were ""incredibly relieved"" by the verdict. ""The public nuisance charge in this case, which argued their protest could have caused serious distress, annoyance or inconvenience to the public, was wholly inadequate and, in our view, should never have been brought, and amounted to an affront to their right to protest,"" she said. ""It is a relief that the jury has decided to uphold the right to peaceful protest,"" she added. Ms Cociani said the right to peaceful protest was ""an essential pillar of our democratic society"" which ""time and time again"" is being ""eroded"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjekdqj7529o
2025-11-01,PCCs back fresh call for catapult restrictions,science,BBC,"Two of the South East's Police and Crime Commissioners (PCC) have backed a new attempt to restrict the carrying and use of catapults. Wildlife campaigners have launched a parliamentary petition to introduce a licensing scheme for the weapons, restricting who can carry them in public. They say there has been an increasing use of catapults in attacks on animals. The PCCs of Surrey and Kent have given their backing to a tightening of the law. The latest petition is the campaigners' third attempt to change the law. It will receive an official response from the government, after in October revealed the extent to which powerful catapults were being used in anti-social behaviour and crime. The latest petition would make carrying a catapult in public without a reasonable reason an offence, similar to carrying an air gun. Matthew Scott, the PPC for Kent, said: ""I agree with the petition and its aim. ""Too much harm and danger is being caused to residents, business and wildlife with illegal and reckless behaviour. ""Giving the police extra powers to seize them, without a lawful purpose, will help make people and our wildlife safer."" Surrey deputy PCC Ellie Vesey-Thompson believes those carrying catapults for legitimate reasons such as angling could be asked to prove it. ""Let's just switch the burden onto the carrier rather than it being on the police officer who stops them,"" she said. ""There's no paperwork, you just have to prove on the spot, when you're stopped by an officer, that you have a legitimate purpose for carrying that catapult. ""That might be you produce your rod licence and show that you're going fishing."" Several councils and police districts have introduced temporary localised bans, using public space protection orders (PSPOs) in hot spots. ""We need something that's more broad that covers everybody all of the time, so we don't constantly have to be applying for PSPOs,"" said Ms Vesey-Thompson. A government spokesman said: ""Catapults should not be used for illegal purposes, whether against people, wildlife or property.

Cotswold Wildlife Park, in Oxfordshire, said Markus was the only white rhino born in the UK this year, adding that the event was caught on camera. It said the calf was healthy and nursing well from his mother Nancy, who has had seven calves with breeding male Monty.

2025-11-01,"'We need food, we have no food' - desperation takes hold in Jamaica after hurricane",science,BBC,"People walk along muddied roads scavenging the wreckage for food. Others jump into damaged stores in the hope of finding bottled water or other supplies. As the death toll rises, residents of Black River are still searching for loved ones while they also battle to survive, days after Hurricane Melissa made this Jamaican port city ground zero of the devastation seen across the Caribbean. Residents here say they have been living in a state of chaos the last three days since Melissa slammed into them as one of the most powerful category five storms ever recorded in the region. The fierce winds and storm surge that barrelled through here have decimated nearly everything, leaving roads unusable and a trail of destruction that has them increasingly desperate and isolated with no electricity or running water. Capsized boats lie kerbside. Brick buildings are split in half. Giant sheets of metal are twisted between tree branches. Vehicles sit in crumbled pieces. Residents who spoke to the BBC said they have seen no aid trucks in the area so far and described having to eat what food they can find in debris by the roads in the coastal town, nearly 150km (93 miles) west of the capital, Kingston. Others made their way inside battered supermarkets, taking what they could for themselves. ""We have to use whatever we see here, on the street and also in the supermarket,"" Demar Walker explained, sitting in a shaded area down the street from the store to escape the heat and 80% humidity. He said he and others had to climb into the market due to its roof caving in and took what they could. They tossed water and items to others also in need. ""We had to throw food to other people."" Nearby, others told the BBC of a local pharmacy being looted in Black River, describing anarchy as people ran in and out carrying armfuls of drugs and alcohol. ""I saw items covered in mud being hauled out,"" Aldwayne Tomlinson told the BBC. ""At first, I thought the place was still open, but then I really got a second glance. ""I heard a lady say: 'Mi need go get some alcohol.' That's when I knew they were looting the pharmacy as well."" Just down the road, a woman standing atop a pile of debris describes the situation there as ""chaos, chaos. Total. No food. No water"". ""We don't have access to money. We need help. No help has come,"" Chegun Braham continued. One couple told the BBC that they owned multiple stores in the area, several of which they said had been looted. They are now standing guard outside one of their stores in the hope of preventing future thefts. A short walk from the market, Jimmy Esson leaned against a massive metal beam that had been knocked to the ground. ""I lost everything, all my things,"" he said. ""We need food. We have no food."" Survival is the primary concern on most people's minds here. The other is the rising death toll. Officials in Jamaica said on Thursday that at least 19 people had died in the country, a big jump from the five that had been counted the day before. Another 30 have died in neighbouring Haiti due to the storm. ""My community, we have dead bodies there,"" Mr Walker said. He said he, like many others in the area, still has not heard from family and doesn't know if they made it out of the storm alive. Mr Walker is stuck in Black River, sleeping in whoever's house is still standing that will accept him, he says, while his eight-year-old son is in Westmoreland, the next parish over. Westmoreland shares Jamaica's western coast, along with Black River in the St Elizabeth parish, and was also severely damaged by Melissa. ""There's no way of getting to my family to find out if they're OK,"" he said as his eyes began to swell. Along with the unusable roads making travel difficult, there is little to no cell phone service and no electricity or running water in many hard-hit spots. ""The entire town of Black River is devastated,"" the town's Mayor Richard Solomon has said. He noted to local media the desperation of residents who are looting and - while not condoning it - said he understood why it was happening. ""It is a delicate balance,"" Solomon said of the response to it. ""Persons are seizing the opportunity to pick up what they can off the ground [from damaged stores]. However, you have others being a little bit more forceful, where they are trying to get into people's properties to get all sorts of supplies."" Local officials estimate that 90% of the houses here were destroyed. Much of the town's vital infrastructure has been destroyed too, including the local hospital, police station and fire station. ""There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,"" Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said. Aid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly to the main airport in Kingston, but smaller regional airports - some of which are located near where humanitarian assistance is most needed - remain only partly operational. Aid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston by land but many roads remain unpassable in places, including in places like Black River. The town is about a two-hour drive from Kingston but the main road in is - at various points - flooded, damaged and clogged with cars. Michael Tharkurdeen, a local medic, was in the town's fire station when the storm hit. ""We were upstairs, the entire bottom floor was flooded. The water was around maybe four feet going five feet. When the water came in, the seas came in, flooded everywhere,"" he said. ""Nobody could be on the bottom floor. Trust me, there were waves there about this high,"" he added, pointing to his shoulder. People who did make it to him from the flooded-out buildings nearby arrived in bad condition. They had ""lacerations on their hands, their feet"", he says. ""Kids, elders, everybody."" Mr Tharkurdee also found a man ""lifeless"" and with ""no pulse"" once the flood waters receded. ""I'm not a doctor, I'm a medic, so I couldn't pronounce him dead,"" he said. ""All we could have done was document that and cover his body."" By mid-afternoon on Friday, a fleet of military helicopters flew into Black River - with many hoping they came with desperately needed supplies. Armed officials carrying machine guns descended onto the streets and soon the crowds rummaging the looted pharmacy and grocery store had cleared.

Brighton and Hove City Council said an old wildflower bank in Wish Park, Hove, is being replanted while a new chalk wildflower bank is being planted in Vale Park, Portslade. The council said old chalk grassland is a ""globally rare habitat"" and home to many wildflowers and pollinating insects, but it has been in decline in the past 100 years. Tim Rowkins, cabinet member for net zero and environment, said: ""This project shows how beneficial creating wildflower-rich areas in an urban environment can be for our struggling pollinators.""

The thinly gilded early medieval pendant, which has one of its four arms broken and its central stone missing, was found in a field in Leeds last year. It has gone on show at Leeds City Museum after it was bought under the Portable Antiquities Scheme Treasure process. Kat Baxter, Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of archaeology, said: ""Despite its small size, the pendant is a significant find in terms of helping us to build a more complete picture of life in early medieval Leeds, along with other discoveries made locally."" ""Objects representing less wealthy people are less likely to survive, so we do still have a great deal to learn and discover about the local population and how they lived at what was a fascinating period in the history of Leeds,"" she said. The pectoral cross has been displayed alongside a series of illustrations showing how it would once have looked, Ms Baxter said. ""Much of archaeology involves visualising how ancient, often incomplete, artefacts might have looked and how they may have once been used,"" she explained. ""Seeing these beautiful illustrations recreate how this tiny pendant might have looked is a rare, vivid glimpse into the past."" The drawings, by archaeological illustrator John Prudhoe, showed how the cross was decorated with a distinctive interlacing Saxon pattern, a thin layer of gold leaf and a central garnet, Ms Baxter said. It is believed that the pendant, made at a time when Leeds was part of the Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, would have been worn by a church official. The cross has been displayed near the West Yorkshire Hoard, a group of seven objects Dating from the 7th to 11th Centuries, the hoard includes the type of high-quality jewellery which would only have been worn by people of exceptional wealth in Saxon society.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyldje8y2lo
2025-10-31,Health concerns over plastic film recycling plant,science,BBC,"Health concerns have been raised over plans to open the UK's first plastic film recycling facility. Endolys Ltd announced plans to install pyrolysis oil production units at the former Cleveland Bridge site in Darlington, which it has taken over. Liberal Democrat campaigner Simon Thorley has launched a petition calling for plans to be halted, over concerns about the impact of a plant which ""chemically breaks down plastic waste in the middle of our community"". A spokesman for Endolys said the process used diverted ""materials away from incineration and landfill"" and the appropriate environmental permits would be sought. Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition process that can chemically break down plastic into its constituent oil and gas, the Mr Thorley, who previously stood as a Tees Valley mayoral candidate, said he did not believe this was a ""simple, safe recycling plant"". ""Google what a plastics pyrolysis plant does and make your own mind up,"" he said. ""I've made mine up, and we can't allow it here."" Conservative Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen disputed the claims and praised the impact the new facility would have on jobs and investment in the region. He said turning a disused site into ""good quality jobs for local people"" was ""exactly the kind of project our area needs"". Endolys said plastic film was one of the most challenging plastic materials to recycle in the UK, with no current large-scale recycling facilities available and limited kerbside collection. The first phase of the development would see six units process 60,000 tonnes of shredded plastic film waste into 40,000 tonnes of pyrolysis oil each year. All of the film waste will be sourced from municipal waste facilities. A spokesman explained the process took place within ""fully enclosed vessels and within a building"". They added: ""It does not involve combustion and, in fact, diverts materials away from incineration and landfill, delivering an estimated 170,000 tonnes of CO2 savings per year.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzz2pp3y5o

2025-10-31,"Plastic spends century on ocean surface, study finds",science,BBC,"Plastic pollution in the ocean could remain on the water's surface for more than a century, a new study has found. Scientists from HR Wallingford, in Oxfordshire, and Queen Mary University created a model to simulate the breakdown of plastic and how long it takes to end up in the deep sea. They found that existing pollution would still float on the surface for more than 100 years, even if no more floating plastic was dumped in the ocean. Those behind the study said the research offered ""critical insights"" into ""the challenges of removing plastic from marine environments"". Prof Andrew Manning, technical director at HR Wallingford, said: ""This study helps explain why so much of the plastic we expect to find at the ocean surface is missing."" He explained that as large plastics fragment over decades, they ""become small enough to attach"" to marine snow - which are tiny organic particles that sink to the ocean floor. But, even after a hundred years, he said fragments could still be found at surface level ""floating and breaking down"". The study found that the breakdown of plastic over the time was ""the limiting factor"" in removing it from the ocean surface. It found that after a century, about 10% of the original plastic could remain afloat, where it releases harmful microplastics into the water. ""To tackle the problem properly, we need long-term thinking that goes beyond just cleaning the surface,"" Prof Manning said. The study is the third and final one of its kind by Queen Mary University of London and HR Wallingford exploring the journey of plastic in the ocean.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v5jgyq20o

2025-10-31,Study measures value of animal welfare to shoppers,science,BBC,"A new tool for measuring the economic value of farm animal welfare improvements has been developed. Researchers from the University of Reading said it could transform how supermarkets, shoppers and the government evaluate animal welfare policies. Professor Richard Bennett has created a system that assigns comparable welfare scores to different farming systems, linking them to what UK households are willing to pay. He said: ""For too long, animal welfare has been difficult to factor into policy decisions because we lacked a standardised way to measure its value."" The method uses a 0-100 welfare score, where zero represents extreme suffering and 100 denotes the highest achievable welfare. An expert panel of 13 independent animal scientists was asked to assess various farming systems. They considered factors including physical health, mental wellbeing and opportunities for natural behaviours throughout an animal's life, from birth to slaughter. Then they surveyed more than 3,000 UK households to determine what they would pay for welfare improvements. It showed people value animal welfare improvements more highly when current conditions are poor, with willingness to pay declining as welfare standards rise. The study suggested households would collectively pay £496m per year to move the 21% of hens in cages to free-range, equivalent to 20p per egg. Giving chickens more space per bird would increase welfare scores from 38 to 47  and would benefit birds in their final week before slaughter, at a value of £997 million annually, or 92p per bird. The survey found 85% of respondents agreeing there is a moral duty to safeguard animal welfare, while 86% supported regulation to improve welfare levels across all farm animals. The research was commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and conducted at the School of Agriculture, Policy and Development at the University of Reading.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09xxpwwgxo

2025-10-30,Hurricane leaves trail of destruction across Caribbean,science,BBC,"The scale of devastation left by Hurricane Melissa is becoming clear after the record-setting storm tore through Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba, leaving at least 34 people dead. Although downgraded from a category five to a category two storm, Melissa gathered speed as it swept through the Bahamas on Thursday and is expected to make landfall in Bermuda later. The strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history, the hurricane sustained winds of 298km/h (185 mph) at its peak - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, killing 1,392 people. The US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) reported sustained winds of 165km/h at 12:00 GMT on Thursday. It warned of possible coastal flooding as the storm accelerated north-eastward. Authorities in the Bahamas have since lifted hurricane warnings for the central and southern islands, as well as for the Turks and Caicos. The country's Minister of State for Disaster Risk Management, Leon Lundy, urged residents to remain vigilant, saying: ""Even a weakened hurricane retains the capacity to bring serious devastation."" Nearly 1,500 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas in what officials described as one of the largest operations in Bahamian history. While flooding has disrupted parts of the archipelago, the ministry of tourism said the majority of the country - including Nassau, Freeport, Eleuthera and the Abacos - remained largely unaffected and open to visitors. Across the wider Caribbean, Melissa's powerful winds have torn apart homes and buildings, uprooted trees and left tens of thousands without power. In Cuba, residents of the country's second-largest city Santiago de Cuba worked with machetes to clear streets buried in debris. President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the hurricane had caused ""considerable damage"" but did not provide a casualty figure. In Jamaica, the impact was most severe in the southwestern parish of St Elizabeth, where knee-deep mud and washed-out bridges left towns such as Black River cut off. On the road west out of the capital Kingston we saw minimal damage - some structures torn down, trees strewn across roads and gardens. But once we arrived in central Jamaica we started to see how severely the island had been hit. The town of Mandeville has been, for want of a better word, flattened. A petrol station lost its roof and most of its pumps. Dana Malcolm of the Jamaica Observer described ""very, very slow progress"" along roads still blocked by landslides when reaching St Elizabeth. She told the BBC: ""I was standing in what used to be main street yesterday and I was knee-deep in mud where the road should have been."" Kabien, who runs a beauty business in the Santa Cruz area of St Elizabeth, said she is staying in her house with the roof blown off and flooding because the public shelter is too dangerous. She told the BBC on Thursday morning it was ""extremely traumatic especially for the kids."" She continued: ""We are still at home now. Even though it is flooded and has no roof. We don't have any options. I'm trying to clean up. The shelters aren't safe for my kids. The beddings are too close to random men. There aren't separate areas for kids, men, women and adults."" Communication across Jamaica has been all but severed, with power lines and mobile networks down in much of the southwest. Many families have spent days unable to contact relatives in the hardest-hit parishes. In Black River, the New York Times reported, the relative of one victim walked 15 miles (24km) to the police station to report their loved one dead. Desmond McKenzie, the minister of local government, shared the news that ""amidst all this, a baby was safely delivered under emergency conditions. So there is... a baby Melissa"". Haiti, already mired in gang violence and humanitarian crisis, suffered at least 25 deaths - 10 of them children - largely due to flooding after days of relentless rain, despite the country avoiding a direct hit. The storm is also responsible for at least eight deaths in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic, officials have said.

People from Portglenone in County Antrim to County Kildare in the Republic of Ireland took to the internet to comment on the strange phenomena. According to experts, the object was likely the debris of an Elon Musk SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket which was launched from Florida on Wednesday. It was said to be caused by the process of excess rocket fuel being ejected and freezing, then reflecting light back to earth. The rocket's path matches the reported sightings, experts have said. Mr Musk owns Space X which operates a series of low-earth orbit satellites for Starlink, an international satellite telecommunications service. Leo Enright, a space commentator, said fuel ejecting from rockets is a normal occurrence. He said if the fuel is kept in the rocket there is a danger that it will explode and release debris, so ejecting fuel is standard practice for space companies. Mr Enright explained that lighting conditions are the reason why the spectacle had not been noticed before across the island of Ireland. ""It's all to do with lighting, and also honestly seeing anything from Ireland is a challenge,"" he said. ""So I'm sure it's happened in the sky and we just couldn't see it because of cloud.""

The balls, which are made of lead, were among more than 100 projectiles uncovered at the 279-year-old battleground near Inverness earlier this month. The researchers believe some of the shot was related to one of the last actions of the battle of 16 April 1746. It saw about 150 Irish troops block the way of charging government horsemen, allowing retreating Jacobite fighters to escape. A Jacobite army led by Bonnie Prince Charlie was defeated at Culloden by government forces under the command of the Duke of Cumberland. The University of Glasgow and National Trust for Scotland (NTS) have been The ground, just north of Culloden's memorial cairn, was planted with commercial forestry in the 1950s. The last of the conifers were removed in the 1980s and it is now an area of scrubby vegetation used for grazing cattle. Prof Tony Pollard, of Glasgow University, said: ""We've only had time to make a rapid assessment of our results, but musket balls fired by Jacobite and government troops, including pistol balls fired by government dragoons, likely relate to one of the last actions in the battle."" He said as Jacobites retreated an Irish battalion, sent from France to support the prince, ""made a brave stand"" against hundreds of horse-mounted troops. Prof Pollard said: ""This valiant action helped thousands of Jacobites get away from the field, but it gets only brief mentions in most of the history books. ""A more detailed analysis of the artefacts and their distribution pattern will be required before we can make a definitive statement but at present there are no obvious alternative interpretations."" The Irish suffered heavy casualties and after the battle survivors were held as prisoners of war in a prison ship in England until they were repatriated to France in 1747. NTS head of archaeology Derek Alexander said: ""We are delighted with the results, especially as the ground we investigated didn't appear to hold out a great deal of promise. ""Our volunteers did a fantastic job of enhancing our understanding of the battle and the battlefield as it exists today."" Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, led a rising in 1745 to win the British throne. He was the son of the previous claimant, James Edward Stuart. The Battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746 saw the prince and his forces face King George II's government army, led by the Duke of Cumberland, George's son. The prince was defeated and about 1,600 men were killed - 1,500 of them Jacobites. It has been described as the last pitched battle to be fought on British soil. Last year, NTS said the last finds to be made were connected to a moment when a clan chief fighting for Charlie was badly injured. Donald Cameron of Lochiel is recorded as leading an attack on the government frontline when his ankles were hit by grapeshot - small lead balls fired from artillery weapons. The artefacts were a broken copper alloy shoe buckle and a single piece of grapeshot that shows signs of having hit something - possibly the buckle.

Farmers have faced restrictions for months, and some restrictions eased in August to allow within 12 miles (20km) of the Welsh border. There have been 11 confirmed cases of the disease so far - four in Powys and seven in the temporary control zone in Monmouthshire, according to the Welsh government. , which meant that livestock within the country could move freely, but to move them across the border meant farmers had to test each animal, at a cost of about £70 - Now the Welsh government has issued a nationwide restricted zone, allowing cross-border movement. Wales' deputy first minister for climate change and rural affairs, Huw Irranca-Davies, said it will be implemented on 10 November because by that date ""historic temperature data and modelling work indicates it is very unlikely for midge-borne transmission of Bluetongue virus to occur"". Bluetongue affects cattle, goats, sheep, deer and camelids such as llamas and alpacas. It can cause ulcers or sores around the animal's mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness, foetal deformities and stillbirths. Spread by midges, bluetongue poses no threat to humans or food safety but can have serious consequences for livestock. The latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep died, and midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south-east of England too. But the impact of bluetongue vaccination BTV-3 seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection and managing to recover. The Welsh government said this zone only relates to this specific type of bluetongue, and controls may need to be introduced for positive cases of new bluetongue strains, should these emerge in the future. Irranca-Davies said he appreciated the restrictions on livestock movements and the introduction of a temporary control zone has been ""disruptive for livestock keepers and wider industry"". Richard Irvine, Wales' chief veterinary officer, said animal keepers should continue to ""source stock responsibly, remain vigilant for the signs of bluetongue"" and to report any suspect cases immediately. ""Vaccination remains the best way to protect livestock and livelihoods from the worst impacts of bluetongue, which can include both illness of affected livestock and longer-term effects on fertility and productivity,"" he said. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh conservative MS, said: ""The virus is spread by midges flying through the air, and the idea they would respect borders was always laughable. ""While I welcome that the restrictions will be lifted, this doomed policy has done significant damage to an industry dependent on cross-border trade.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrmzrgrjno

The Ulster Farmers' Union passed the vote during an executive committee meeting on Wednesday, citing dissatisfaction with how the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) are handling key issues. They said this included an ""unjustified focus on agriculture"" regarding the A spokesperson for the department said it is ""disappointed to learn of the UFU vote"", and that it ""is always open to discuss issues with them"". The union said the motion was first suggested in early summer, following the release of the Something that the UFU said was carried out ""without any prior consultation to any of the stakeholders"". UFU president William Irvine said the union had given the department time to see if things would improve but ""after mounting frustration over the last few months on a host of other issues, this vote of no confidence was unanimously agreed"". Mr Irvine described the motion as ""a public expression of our total frustration around Daera at this point in time"". Around the subject of the current state of Lough Neagh Mr Irvine said the issue was ""a Northern Ireland society problem, it's a historic problem and all sections of society need to address this. It's unhelpful to proportion blame that way."" Among other reasons cited by the union for taking action were , ammonia controls and planning in relation to the Nutrients Action Programme. Mr Irvine added the UFU had ""continued to engage with the department in good faith, remaining patient and hopeful that co-operation would yield results, but felt this was not being reciprocated"". ""Daera needs to work with farmers to deliver what is needed, and regrettably this has not happened,"" he added.

Teddy was presented with a British Citizen Youth Award at the Palace of Westminster on Thursday for 'exceptional contribution to the community and being an inspiration to others', he can now use the letters BCyA after his name. He said: ""I can't believe it. This just proves you're never too small to make a big difference."" Teddy was presented with his BCyA Medal of Honour by Tim Vincent and British Citizen Youth Awards ambassador, James Cathcart. The awards, now in its ninth year, honoured 22 young people from across the UK. Teddy said he wants to keep on making a positive impact on the environment and to continue to inspire his peers and the local community. He said: ""It doesn't matter how small you are, you can make a big difference. It's never too late to make a change."" for his school playground, made from his recycled plastic tubs after visiting the warehouse in Exeter where they are processed. Teddy, aged six at the time, decided to take action to recycle the tubs inspired by his hero David Attenborough after learning they ended in landfill because they could not be recycled through kerbside collections in his local area. With help from his mum, Laura, he gathered the tubs from people's houses got his school to send a letter out to parents asking them to drop off their tubs and even rescued them from bins before stacking them up in a storage area. He set a target of 500 tubs but reached 2,598 within a month in February this year. He then took the piles of tubs to his local pub so they could be sent for recycling through the Tub2Pub scheme to make outdoor furniture.

2025-10-31,Iron Age hillfort 'mysteriously faded' from use,science,BBC,"Archaeologists say a hilltop settlement near Perth thrived during the Iron Age before mysteriously fading away - possibly because of invading Romans. Broxy Kennels Fort was first identified in the 1960s on aerial photographs taken along the proposed route of the A9 trunk road. Guard Archaeology excavated the site in 2022 Evidence of ramparts, roundhouses and metalworking, including furnaces for smelting, were uncovered - but archaeologists say it was abandoned and all trace of it above ground lost over the centuries. Since the excavation was completed, Guard archaeologists have led a team of specialists drawn from across Scotland to analyse the archaeological evidence. The experts included staff at National Museums Scotland, the universities of Glasgow and Stirling and various independent specialists. Other discoveries made at Broxy Kennels included evidence of a souterrain, a semi-underground stone-built chamber which could possibly have been used to store grain. Guard Archaeology said it was not clear why Broxy Kennels Fort was abandoned. They said it was possibly because the structure of society changed and the people moved away from that kind of settlement -  or the looming arrival of the Roman army in the late first century AD drove the people away. Guard project officer Kenny Green, who directed the excavation, said: ""Without these aerial photographs no-one would have known there was a hillfort here as there was no trace of it on the ground. ""Centuries of ploughing had removed any surface trace."" The archaeological work was funded by Perth and Kinross Council and managed by construction firm BAM Nuttall Ltd. A report on the excavation and follow up analysis is available for A booklet has also been published and a lecture about Broxy Kennels Fort will be given at the Tayside and Fife Archaeology Conference 2025 in Glenrothes on Saturday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c986ddzqgp8o
2025-10-30,Dozens dead in 'total devastation' left behind by Hurricane Melissa,science,BBC,"Hurricane Melissa has continued its devastating sweep across the Caribbean, destroying homes and infrastructure, flooding neighbourhoods and leaving dozens dead. The impact in Jamaica was clearer on Wednesday, after the island nation was hit squarely by the category five storm - one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the region. At least five people have been confirmed dead there. At least another 20 died during flooding in Haiti as Melissa, now a category two storm, tore through the region. In Jamaica, people remain stranded on roofs and without power. Prime Minister Andrew Holness noted the ""total devastation"" across the island-nation. He added that ""80-90% of roofs were destroyed"", along with hospitals, libraries, police stations, port houses and other urban infrastructure. King Charles, who is the head of state in Jamaica, said in a statement that he was ""deeply concerned"" and ""profoundly saddened"" at the damage caused by Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean. ""This most dreadful of record-breaking storms reminds us of the increasingly urgent need to restore the balance and harmony of Nature for the sake of all those whose lives and livelihoods may have been shattered by this heartbreaking disaster,"" he said. From Jamaica, where the storm also , Melissa moved north to Cuba as a category three storm, bringing  115 mph winds and heavy rain, and battering the south-east of the island. Rovier Mesa Rodríguez, a video maker who lives in Santiago de Cuba, called the storm ""terrifying"" and described it sounding ""like a tornado"". Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel asked residents to ""not let their guard down"" and said that the country had prepared for a worst-case scenario, which helped its response. On Wednesday night, the storm was 105 miles (170km) from the central Bahamas and expected to reach the Bahamas region overnight. Hurricane Melissa was moving north-east with wind speeds at 100 mph (155 km/h).  A dangerous storm surge is expected there before it moves further north toward Bermuda. A tropical storm warning is in place for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the speed of the slow-moving hurricane is expected to increase in the coming days. In Jamaica, three men and a woman were confirmed dead. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters in the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of Local Government and Community Development. About three-quarters of the country lost electricity overnight. Richard Vernon, mayor of Montego Bay, told the BBC that half of the city had been cut off from the other by floods. He said the priority was to ""check if everybody is alive"". A resident in St Elizabeth sheltering in her four-bedroom home described the moment her roof blew off. Gordon Swaby, a businessman in Kingston, told the BBC that his first cousin's house was completely destroyed. His cousin - who he declined to be named - recently moved from the United States to her ""dream"" house by the sea in the upscale Crane Road area. She lost the entire concrete structure and everything in it. ""She wanted a different kind of life,"" Gordon said. ""She chose the area because she loves the sea, so this is really devastating."" Devastation was evident on Wednesday across central Jamaica. The city of Mandeville was flattened and the main road through town was littered with debris. Foliage was stuck to everything, and bits of building material were scattered along the road. The clean-up is expected to take months. Pia Chevallier, who is on holiday in Jamaica, said she felt ""sick with worry"" during the storm overnight. ""The windows didn't stop vibrating."" In Haiti, at least 20 people - including 10 children - , local authorities told AFP news agency. The island, which the country shares with the Dominican Republic, was struck by catastrophic flash flooding and landslides, which forced 3,000 people into shelters. ""Many homes have been washed away on the coast,"" said Pascal Bimenyimana from the Christian NGO, World Relief, in Port-au-Prince. Structures also lost their roofing and people were clearing the debris with their bare hands, he said. Torrential winds, violent rain and flooding destroyed crops across the country's south. The US is sending a disaster response team to Jamaica to assess the scale of need in the hurricane's aftermath. Formal requests for help came from Haiti and The Bahamas, according to senior State Department officials. The assistance comes in the wake of the Trump administration's closure of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was the world's biggest aid agency, amid cuts to foreign assistance by billions of dollars. Melissa is not expected to make landfall in North America, but will still be a formidable extratropical cyclone when it nears St Johns, Newfoundland, in Canada on Friday night.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kvrnyy4wo
2025-10-29,"Jamaicans take stock after hurricane causes damage, flooding and power cuts",science,BBC,"Jamaicans are taking stock after Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike the island in modern history, barrelled across the country leaving behind a trail of ruin. Without power or phone coverage, much of the country is isolated and so information is trickling through. Authorities were only able to confirm the first deaths as a result of the hurricane over 24 hours after landfall. The bodies of three men and one woman were washed up by the flood waters in St Elizabeth Parish, local government minister Desmond McKenzie said. There, Prime Minister Andrew Holness said ""images of destruction are all around"". ""The damage is great, but we are going to devote all our energy to mount a strong recovery,"" he said. Three-quarters of the country are still without power, according to the latest media briefing. On the road west out of the capital Kingston we saw minimal damage - some structures torn down, trees strewn across roads and gardens. But once we arrived in central Jamaica we started to see how severely the island has been hit. The town of Mandeville has been, for want of a better word, flattened. A petrol station had lost its roof and most of its pumps. The main road that runs through the town is littered in debris, foliage is stuck to everything and bits of building material were scattered along the road. By early Wednesday the hurricane had made landfall in Cuba, causing flooding and damage. , most when a river burst its banks in Petit-Goave, the local mayor said. At its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph) - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people. It has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane. As wind and rain lashed through the night, one local Jamaican official said the destruction resembled ""the scene of an apocalypse movie"". Many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after the hurricane tore across the island with catastrophic force. People have shared clips of roads that became rivers, mudslides on the hills, roofs being ripped from buildings and palm trees tossed like tooth picks. In the town of Black River on the south-west coast, police officer Warrell Nicholson was sheltering in the damaged police station along with some residents. ""It's been devastating,"" he told the AFP news agency. Further up the coast, Andrew Houston Moncure was sheltering in the luxury hotel he owns, with his wife and 20-month-old son. At the height of the hurricane they barricaded themselves inside the shower, which they fortified with pillows and blankets. ""It was the most terrifying experience, especially with my son. The pressure is so low you struggle to breathe, and it just sounds like a freight train going over you,"" he told AFP. Across Jamaica's central parishes, flood waters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes, Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner said. Verna Genus, a 73-year-old vegetable farmer, was sheltering from the storm with her sons and baby grandchild at her four-bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house. ""She was crying on the phone,"" her UK-based sister June said, adding: ""You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that - she was wailing 'we are all finished'."" She is anxiously waiting for communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister. St Elizabeth, known as Jamaica's breadbasket, produces much of the island's produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover. Jamaica's prime minister told the BBC in some instances ""there was total devastation"" and that one town named Black River had been ""totally destroyed"". On the north coast, Montego Bay - the heart of Jamaica's tourism industry and home to its main airport - will also take time to get back on its feet. Montego city was split in two by flood waters, Mayor Richard Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water."" His immediate concern, he added, was simple: ""Check if everybody is alive."" In rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: ""Right now, what I'm seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous."" Meteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters - part of a broader trend linked to climate change. By the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles. Health officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that flood waters could drive the reptiles into residential areas. For thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty. ""I've never heard anything like it,"" said Pia Chevallier from Cambridge, who travelled to Jamaica with her 15-year-old son on Saturday. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live from her darkened hotel room, she said: ""The glass in the windows and patio doors was all vibrating. The doors sounded like they were slamming, even though they were closed. It was horrendous."" She added: ""There's debris everywhere - palm trees, coconuts, branches, all over the place. The big palm trees with all the roots are up. That's how strong the winds have been."" On the north coast, Wayne Gibson, a British tourist from Kent holidaying in Ocho Rios with his wife and two teenage daughters, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they were sheltering in a communal hall. Kyle Holmes from Bolton, visiting Lucea in the north west, described the hotel as ""a disaster zone"" and said he had no idea when they will be able to get home. Jamaica has a catastrophe bond - a type of insurance for the country - which will hopefully allow people to get back on their feet, but the issue is what's done in the interim.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl09v025lo
2025-10-30,Largest robotic surgery training centre opens,science,BBC,"The UK's largest robotic-assisted surgery training centre has been opened. The facility in Winnersh, near Reading, provides training for surgeons from around the world to use the da Vinci surgical system. The system is operated by a human and uses robot arms to perform delicate and complex operations. In June, NHS England announced its intention to use robotic assistance in nine out of 10 keyhole surgeries by 2035. There are more than 200 da Vinci surgical systems being used in hospitals in the UK and Ireland with more than 300,000 patients having being operated on by surgeons using the machines. ""It is referred to as robotic-assisted surgery but it is very much controlled by an experienced, qualified surgeon who manipulates the instruments using a different part of the machine to allow us to do the surgery,"" said Gijs van Boxel, a Consultant Upper Gastrointestinal surgeon in Portsmouth. The surgeon operates the arms of the machine by sitting at a console and viewing a magnified, high definition, 3D screen, moving the robot arms using finger movements. ""It feels futuristic but the concept of robotic-assisted surgery is not a new one, the development that's gone into this over the various iterations has been extensive, lots of lessons have been learnt."" ""The precision permitted through this system has allowed better outcomes for our patience which is ultimately why we do this,"" he said. ""Today, we've been training on metabolic surgery. We've got French surgeons visiting from Montpellier. ""We've got people coming from all over Europe to Reading, to Winnersh Triangle, to help them gain proficiency in robotic surgery. So that's a super exciting development and something to be proud of,"" he added.

Surrey Wildlife Trust said the plastic seasonal decorations could trap and kill hedgehogs, birds and insects when hung on trees, hedges and fences. Plastic cobwebs are often made of very fine strands, which are not biodegradable and can be harmful to the environment, according to the conservation group. : ""We don't want to be killjoys, but keep your plastic webs inside."" He added: ""Go easy on the plastics and use other stuff too."" Up to 80% of Halloween merchandise is made predominately from cheap plastics and an estimated seven million costumes are sent to landfill each year, according to the wildlife trust. In a blog on the charity's website, Marcus Wehrle said: ""Halloween costumes are largely made up of plastic. ""Rather than buying new, you could buy a second hand costume online, or why not create your own from clothing brought from a charity shop? ""Not only will you be helping the planet, you'll be supporting a worthy cause too."" Mr Wehrle added: ""You don't need to buy plastic pumpkins and bat bunting. ""With a little effort you could make your own decorations from reusable or recyclable materials."" The wildlife organisation also pointed out that discarding pumpkins outdoors can be harmful to hedgehogs and other species if eaten. It estimates that up to 95% of the UK's 10 million pumpkins are produced purely for Halloween, with many going ""straight in the bin"" after the event.

Most were killed when a river burst its bank in Petit-Goave, leaving 25 dead, the town's mayor said. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) had earlier warned that Melissa was likely to cause ""catastrophic"" flash flooding and landslides. Haiti is significantly less developed than its neighbours, and is therefore likely to see ""extensive damage and isolation of communities"" as a result of the devastation caused by the hurricane, the NHC says. In Petit-Goave, in southern Haiti, many people remained trapped in collapsed houses. ""I am overwhelmed by the situation,"" Mayor Jean Bertrand Subrème told AP. Along Haiti's southern coast, many homes have been washed away. ""You can see many roofs have been taken off. People are clearing the debris with their bare hands,""  described Pascal Bimenyimana from the World Relief NGO. Mr Bimenyimana said 3,000 people remained in shelters in the south of the country. Hurricane Melissa has caused havoc across parts of the Caribbean, with Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti worst affected. The storm, which unleashed 185mph winds on Jamaica, left most of the island without power.

2025-10-30,Climate change intensified India's heatwaves in 2024 - Lancet study,science,BBC,"Almost one-third of the heatwave days India experienced in 2024 were driven by climate change, according to a new report by the medical journal The Lancet. The report found that India recorded an average of 19.8 heatwave days last year, of which 6.6 days would not have occurred without human-induced climate change. It also estimated that heat exposure in 2024 resulted in the loss of 247 billion potential labour hours, mostly in the agriculture and construction sectors. amounting to an economic loss of about $194bn (£151bn). While heatwaves are not new to India, their frequency and intensity have been rising steadily over the past few decades because of global warming. Prolonged exposure to extreme heat has serious repercussions on health. It can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of dehydration, heatstroke, cardiovascular stress, and even death - particularly among the elderly, infants and outdoor workers. And the 2025 Lancet Countdown report - which tracks the health impact of climate change and is widely regarded as a key scientific reference on the issue - warns that the health risks posed by rising global temperatures are now more severe than ever. ""Throughout last year,152 record-breaking extreme weather events were registered across 61 countries, and life-threatening, extreme heat events are becoming more intense than previously predicted,"" the report stated. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis. Every fraction of a degree of warming costs lives and livelihoods,"" said Jeremy Farrar, assistant director-general for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care at the World Health Organization (WHO). The report found that heat-related mortality has increased by 23% worldwide since the 1990s, with an average of around 546,000 deaths each year. It also found that the average person worldwide was exposed to 16 days of extreme heat last year that would not have occurred without climate change. ""This [report] paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world,"" said Dr Marina Romanello, of University College London, who led the report's analysis. ""The destruction to lives and livelihoods will continue to escalate until we end our fossil fuel addiction,"" she added. The report also mentioned that India's air quality has worsened over the past few years. Every year as the winter sets in, the air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plains turns toxic. This year too, the air quality has remained between poor and very poor category - at times, reaching hazardous - for almost a month now. The report mentioned that 1.7 million deaths in 2022 were caused due to atmospheric pollution, particularly because of the tiny PM2.5 pollutants that can cause a host of serious health issues. Harmful emissions from burning fossil fuel led to 44% of these deaths. It also noted that the heavy reliance on biofuels such as wood, dung and crop residue for cooking continues to silently claim thousands of lives across the country - especially among women and children in rural areas. The report was released ahead of the COP30 summit, which is going to take place in Brazil next month.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp8r4ryvmo
2025-10-30,Animal centre may shut if expansion not approved,science,BBC,"A long-running wildlife centre said it would ""probably close"" if plans for its new £2m animal hospital were not given the green light. Suffolk Hedgehog Hospital, on the outskirts of Newmarket, wants to build the Long Acre Wildlife Hospital on 27 acres of land on the Suffolk and Cambridgeshire border. The complex itself, which would also serve Norfolk and Essex, would be about one acre in size and be able to accommodate as many as 500 hedgehogs at any one time. East Cambridgeshire District Council's planning department will discuss the application once the consultation ends on Thursday. The charity was founded 18 years ago by Sue Stubley, who cares for as many as 1,000 hedgehogs, as well as other animals, every year from her home in Ousden. She and her team of volunteers nurse the animals back to health before releasing them back into the wild. While she remains as passionate as ever about the work she does, the lack of space in which she and her team of volunteers have to operate is starting to take its toll. ""We simply do not have enough space, and we are now at the stage where it is absolutely insane,"" the 63-year-old told the BBC. ""There's about 22 hedgehogs in the kitchen, another 20 in the lounge, tiny babies in my bedroom, a fox in the shower, and a dove in the bath. ""I love the animals that I have here, but I cannot bear the chaos. I like everything super, super tidy, so this is absolute torture to me - I am pretty much at my wits' end."" Plans for the project were previously rejected by the council after concerns were raised about noise, traffic, and the visual impact it could have on the countryside. But, after going back to the drawing board and resubmitting the proposals, Ms Stubley is now hopeful that her dream of a larger home may still become a reality. At the time of writing, 12 people had objected to the project, while more than 180 people had voiced their support for it. ""We've got a completely new team, revamped everything and looked at things, so we're hopeful we've countered all the issues that were raised,"" she added. ""It is a huge job, but I am confident we can do it. I will fund a considerable amount personally, but we will need a bit of help funding some of it. ""It will make an unbelievable difference, and I might have a tiny bit of a life and be able to cook something without having hedgehogs on my counter."" If given the green light, the hospital could be built within the next two years and would be able to accommodate more animals and more volunteers to help out. But if the plans were thrown out for a second time, it could spell the end - not just for the future of the project, but for the charity as a whole. ""Hedgehogs are the sweetest little creatures, but they are desperately endangered, they don't have a voice, and they need our help,"" said Ms Stubley. ""But I cannot sustain what we're doing here, and I suspect we would probably close, which would be a disaster. ""I have been doing this for 18 years and it has taken over my life, which I don't mind, but we desperately need a bigger premises – so it has to go ahead.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkz1l28n2o

The three-week hearing was to consider a decision to refuse plans for the 92-hectare (227-acre) solar farm in Burnhope, County Durham, after developers Lightsource bp appealed to the government's Planning Inspectorate. There were complaints Durham County Council failed to inform the public about the inquiry within the required time frame, and it has now been adjourned. The authority has apologised for the error and said the inquiry will be rescheduled for next year. The council had approved the solar farm in March 2023, but after a judicial review and legal challenge by Burnhope residents, the permission was quashed by the planning court in February 2024, ruling the scheme ""unlawful"". An amended plan was submitted but was turned down by the council's planning committee. Its future now rests with government planners. However, campaigners claim that despite significant public interest in the inquiry,  people living in Burnhope, Lanchester, Maiden Law, Quaking Houses and South Moor did not know when it was due to be held. Ian Galloway, of the Keep it Green group, told the : ""This creates a very significant risk that the interests of people have been prejudiced. ""The other problem that this failure creates is one of trust and legitimacy. ""Lack of notification compromises natural justice, undermines public confidence in the process, and risks the inquiry's legitimacy."" He added: ""The people who do know about the public inquiry have been left with the question; how can the public inquiry be a fair and just process of law if the public has been failed to be informed?"" Stephen Reed, Durham County Council's planning manager, said: ""Due to an error, residents were not given enough notice of the public inquiry starting - we are sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.

Jenny Shepherd, with her apt surname, and her partner own the world's largest flock of Manx Loaghtans on Ballacosnahan Farm and hope to raise awareness of the breed's commercial viability. Ms Shepherd calls them ""amazing sheep, their wool is fabulous"", adding their meat was ""more like venison than lamb, which absolutely lends itself to charcuterie"". They have kept Loaghtans since 2003 on their 200-acre (80-hectare) farm stretching from the top of Slieau Whallian down to the river Neb. Ms Shepherd said with such a variety of terrain, the breed was also ""perfect for conservation grazing"". ""They thrive on rough moorland where you've got loads of different wild flowers and plants, and they just do much better on that sort of ground,"" she said. The breed dates back 1,000 years on the island, but it was not until the early 1800s that white sheep began to spread, which were ""bigger and matured quicker"", Ms Shepherd said. ""Over the 1800s they almost completely displaced the Loaghtans,"" she added. It was then a man called Ceaser Bacon noticed the decline and ""rounded up what he could"" and, in 1895, ""realised he only had four ewes that were fit to breed from"". ""So most of the world population comes from those four ewes"", Ms Shepherd explained, adding it was ""an amazing story of survival"". While Loaghtans took longer to mature, meaning they had to be cared for over the winter, Ms Shepherd said the meat was ""really quite special"" and their wool was worth a lot more than white sheep. And, despite having the largest flock in the world, Ms Shepherd said it was ""not a badge I wear with pride"". ""I would love it if there were some other big commercial Loaghtan farms because that would be much safer for their future,"" she said. ""It's really sad [that] they're so endangered - they're truly Manx animals."" Alice Lennox, the Scottish co-ordinator for the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, said: ""Unfortunately, since 2022, there's been a 34% decrease in the number of Manx Loaghtan dams producing pedigree offspring. ""Their rarity is precisely why it's important to maintain them and using them sustainably through wool production, meat production, and habitat management, that will help secure their future."" She added that ""eating them actually is supporting them"". ""There is a merit in economic incentive, in buying their meat, eating them - and it gives farmers a reason to keep them and breed them as well,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20zqk5p716o
2025-10-29,Galloway Hills wind farm heads to public inquiry,science,BBC,"Councillors have agreed to oppose a wind farm in the Galloway Hills - triggering a public inquiry into the plans. Opponents of the 14-turbine Blair Hill project near Newton Stewart gathered outside Dumfries and Galloway Council offices to highlight their concerns. Planning committee councillors agreed to object to the plans due to concerns over the impact on a regional scenic area (RSA). Developer RES said it was disappointed the local authority had opposed what it described as a ""well-designed project"". Protesters from the Hands Off Our Hills group gathered outside the council offices in Dumfries before the development was discussed to raise their concerns about the proposal. Robert Burton grew up in a house close to the development site where his parents - both in their 70s - still live. He said their world had ""fallen apart"". ""The nearest turbines are only one kilometre from the house and more worrying is the access road to the site,"" he said. ""It is a couple of hundred metres away from the back of the house and very close to the private water supply as well."" Another protester, Sian McKinnon, told BBC Scotland News she believed the scheme was unnecessary. ""We have enough renewable energy in Scotland - we overproduce,"" she said. ""So this is about exporting energy to England. This is not helping us and our communities, it is not helping us in our approach to net zero. ""It doesn't make sense, there is no logic to this - it is about making money for companies."" Developers said the project could generate enough electricity to meet the annual needs of more than 115,000 homes. They added that it could save more than eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over its operational life as well as providing a community benefits package of nearly £25m. However, councillors decided to follow officer recommendations and oppose the plans, which now means they will go to public inquiry. They had concerns about the impact on a scenic area, how lighting might affect the Galloway Dark Sky Park and the effect on a ""highly valued upland landscape"". Sarah McArthur, development project manager at RES, said: ""Blair Hill is a well-designed project, which carefully considers the local landscape and environment. ""Naturally we're disappointed that an objection has been raised, particularly when Blair Hill has the potential to deliver discounted electricity for local residents, an £87m boost to the economy and up to £55m in business rates to support vital local services.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51en6zkydo

2025-10-28,What makes Melissa such a dangerous storm?,science,BBC,"A very powerful hurricane has made landfall in Jamaica and is the strongest storm to hit the Caribbean island in modern history. Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 4 storm, first hit the island's southern coast with maximum sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) - the strongest on Earth so far this year. Those speeds are above those of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, one of the worst storms in US history. For a nation already living on the front lines of a changing climate, the threat is grave. So why is this particular hurricane so dangerous? Tropical Storm Melissa took shape last Tuesday before rapidly strengthening as it moved west through the Caribbean. A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface and creates a spinning system of clouds and storms. In the centre, air sinks, creating the eye, a calm, cloud-free zone surrounded by a wall of violent winds and rain known as the eye-wall. Melissa's origins trace back to a cluster of thunderstorms off the coast of West Africa in mid-October. By 21 October it had reached tropical storm strength and by 26 October, it was a Category 4 beast churning through the Caribbean Sea. Ocean temperatures in the Caribbean are unusually high this year and hurricanes feed off that warm layer of water. Those conditions allowed Melissa to intensify quickly. ""The ocean is warmer and the atmosphere is warmer and moister because of [climate change],"" says Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami. ""So it tips the scale in favour of things like rapid intensification [where wind speeds increase very quickly], higher peak intensity, and increased rainfall."" Melissa ranks as one of the strongest storms in the Atlantic this century. For Jamaicans, the comparisons with past storms are chilling. If it strikes Jamaica at close to full strength, it could eclipse all the storms the island has experienced before. Gilbert in 1988, the last direct hit, was a Category 3. It destroyed thousands of homes and killed 49 people. Dean in 2007 and Beryl in 2024 came close, but neither matched Melissa's power. The storm's central air pressure dropped to 892 millibars as of the National Hurricane Center's advisory on Tuesday morning local time, below Hurricane Katrina's 902 mb. The lower the pressure, the more violent the winds - making this one of the most powerful systems ever to form in the Atlantic. Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, killed 1,392 people and caused damage estimated at $125bn (£94bn). ""This is going to be the strongest hurricane that's ever hit [Jamaica], at least in the records we have,"" Dr Fred Thomas, a research software engineer at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, told the BBC. The storm has been blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Jamaica's minister of health said on Monday that three people had died on the island while preparing for the approaching storm. Melissa strengthened particularly quickly, fuelled by very warm waters in the Caribbean, around one to two degrees above average. ""There has been a perfect storm of conditions leading to the colossal strength of Hurricane Melissa,"" Dr Leanne Archer, research associate in climate extremes at the University of Bristol, said. While the wind speed is staggeringly high, the storm's movement is notably slow. Melissa itself was crawling westward at around 5km/h on Tuesday- slower than a person's walking pace. That lethargy, meteorologists warn, could be catastrophic as it means that a hurricane can bring rain to a single location for days on end, aggravating flooding. When hurricanes stall, they linger over one area for far longer than normal, leading to repeated waves of rain, flooding and wind damage. One of the most famous examples of this is Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which stalled over Houston in the US. Harvey released 100cm of rain in just three days, causing catastrophic flooding. The US National Hurricane Center has warned that Jamaica could see 38 to 76 cm of rain, with as much as a metre in some mountainous areas. Storm surges of up to four metres are possible, especially along the island's southern and eastern shores. Low-lying parishes such as Clarendon and St Catherine are at risk of flash flooding not only from rainfall but also from torrents rushing down from the Blue Mountains. ""Imagine a metre of rainfall coming down in a whole basin and then being channelled down into a river network. That's going to be metres and metres of flooding by the time it reaches the lower parts of that drainage network. So the flooding will probably result in a large loss of life, I imagine,"" Dr Thomas, who visited Jamaica earlier this year, said. Some research suggests hurricanes are generally moving more slowly than they used to. That means more storms like Melissa can sit, rather than sweep, over the land they hit. And some scientists believe that might be to do with how climate change is affecting circulation patterns in our atmosphere, but that is far from certain and natural variability may also be playing a role. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has already warned that ""no infrastructure can withstand a Category 5"". Dr Thomas largely agrees, but explained that most new buildings in Jamaica were made of reinforced concrete, as required by national building codes. ""Anything built to that code should be pretty strong in terms of the wind, but the wind has only one impact,"" he said. ""The frightening thing about Melissa is not just the wind - it's the rain and the storm surge. You could have your whole ground floor completely inundated and then part of the first floor as well."" In major cities like Kingston and Montego Bay, the construction is more robust, he said, but in rural and hillside areas, ""there's more vernacular architecture [some things built from wood] not the larger, concrete-type buildings"". Those will fare far worse. ""This hurricane will be very hard on Jamaica,"" says Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jamaica is ""unprepared to cope effectively"" with major storms, Dr Patricia Green, an architect and preservationist based in Kingston told the BBC. She recalled how ""a couple of hours of rainfall"" in September caused ""massive flooding"" in the capital, exposing deep weaknesses in urban planning. She criticised the surge of high-rise developments ""sited in areas that should be the runoff of the city"", saying they had brought flooding to districts ""that never had flooding before"". As a low-lying island nation, it is particularly exposed to storms. About 70% of the population resides in coastal areas, according to data from the Jamaican government. And as is the case with extreme weather, poorer communities are expected to be most badly affected. ""This is one of those worst-case scenarios that you prepare for but desperately hope never happen,"" says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. ""The whole country will have a deep and permanent scar from this beast of a storm. It will be a long and exhausting recovery for those affected."" Tourism is another concern. Jamaica's big resorts are largely made from concrete, but their strength has never been tested by winds of this magnitude. Other parts of the country's infrastructure are more exposed, with electricity expected to go out. Dr Thomas said: ""The grid will probably take areas offline before the worst of the storm. But then you've got poles and lines brought down by debris and trees. It's often not the wind itself, but what the wind picks up."" Beyond the buildings, the storm threatens Jamaica's power, water and transport networks. Fallen trees and flying debris are expected to down power lines. Flooding could overwhelm sewage systems and contaminate water supplies. Landslides are likely to cut off mountain roads, isolating rural communities. Dr Green said modern architectural trends are worsening resilience and the move from traditional jalousie windows with slats to fixed glass can leave buildings more exposed. The sealed panes prevent air from passing through, increasing pressure inside and making walls and roofs more likely to fall when storms strike. The most vulnerable, she added, are the poorer communities, particularly those living along riverbanks and gullies, which Dr Green says is a ""historical, colonial issue"", tracing back to emancipation, when formerly enslaved people were granted marginal lands. Many of these families, she said, have lived there for generations, without affordable alternatives or secure land titles. Dr Thomas pointed particularly to Port Royal which is a small fishing village in Kingston, considered one of the most hurricane-vulnerable communities and on the compulsory evacuation list. He visited in February, explaining: ""It's sort of a long spit of land and it's extremely exposed with a seven or eight-mile drive back to the mainland, so it could be quite easily cut off."" The ripple effects of any one failure can be wide: ""Power goes out, and then telecommunications go. Hospitals have backup for a while, but often not long enough. And the airport's closed, which means aid can't get in quickly."" With airports closed, supply chains disrupted and aid flights grounded, even after the storm passes, recovery may take months.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3d71q32w5o

2025-10-29,Public asked for views on CO₂ capture pipeline plan,science,BBC,"A public consultation on plans to transfer and store carbon dioxide (CO₂) under the North Sea is taking place. The Humber Carbon Capture Pipeline (HCCP) would run underground for 57 miles  (about 92km) from the Drax power station near Selby, North Yorkshire, along the south Humber bank in North and North East Lincolnshire before heading under the river to a terminal at Easington, on the East Yorkshire coast. The CO₂ would be stored in the Endurance saline aquifer in the North Sea. The Humber region produces 12.4 million tonnes of CO₂ a year, more than any other UK region, according to National Grid. There would be pumping stations above ground, and the pipeline would have connecting pipes to capture emissions from industrial sites along the route. Rich Denny, managing director of developer Northern Endurance Partnership, said: ""The HCCP has the potential to be a game-changer for businesses across the Humber, driving economic growth while decarbonising operations. ""This consultation is a chance for people to have their say and help shape a project that builds on the region's proud industrial legacy."" The proposed pipeline is classed as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project,  which means a decision on whether to approve it will be made by the government rather than local councils. The public consultation runs until 17 December with a series of events in towns and villages across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.

Dave Rich, head of operations at RSPCA Cornwall, said: ""The ducks were kept in small conditions in cramped spaces with limited access to food and water."" RSPCA Cornwall said it wanted to find safe, suitable homes where the ducks could live the life they deserved. It said the birds were bonded in small groups and pairs and would need to be rehomed in their chosen ""quack pack"". Mr Rich said after more than a year in the care of staff at the RSPCA centre in St Columb, the ducks could now be rehomed. He added: ""What we've done is provide them with a small space and gradually build on that space to provide what they'd be more used to in a suitable environment."" He said it would have been damaging to the health of the ducks to rush their rehabilitation. ""It's worth it when you get this opportunity to put these animals into an environment where they're going to be able to be their best selves,"" said Mr Rich.

2025-10-29,A really simple guide to climate change,science,BBC,"Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, posing serious threats to people and nature. Things are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue urgent action can still limit the worst effects of climate change. Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions. The world has been warming up quickly over the past 100 years or so. As a result, weather patterns are changing. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, the UK Met Office says. And the world's ten warmest years on record have all happened since 2015, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). , with climate change mainly responsible for the high temperatures. It was also the first calendar year to surpass 1.5C of warming compared to ""pre-industrial"" levels of the late 1800s, according to the The climate has changed naturally throughout the Earth's history. But natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen over the last century, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). , in particular the widespread use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport systems. When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). This CO2 acts like a blanket, trapping extra energy in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface. This causes the planet to heat up. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - , far above levels seen in the Earth's recent history. has a distinctive chemical fingerprint. This matches the type of CO2 increasingly found in the atmosphere. Climate change has already had a huge effect, including: These changes are already having serious consequences for people and economies around the world. For example, the Los Angeles fires of January 2025 could have a according to some estimates - one of the most expensive weather-related disasters in US history. Many factors were at play, but climate change that gave rise to the fires, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. , putting more than 20 million people at risk of severe hunger. Climate change has made droughts like this The particular vulnerabilities of individual communities across the globe determine who is affected by these extreme events, and how badly. The more the world warms, the worse the impacts of climate change become. Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as part of the That target is generally understood to relate to an average annual increase of 1.5C recorded over 20 years, rather than a one-off rise captured in an individual 12-month period. But a very large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring , on top of those felt at 1.5C, the IPCC says. The call to restrict temperature rise to 1.5C was partly designed to avoid crossing so-called ""tipping points"". It is not clear exactly where they sit, but once these thresholds are passed, changes could accelerate and become irreversible. These could include the collapse of the About 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to the IPCC. People living in poorer countries are expected to suffer most as they have fewer resources to adapt. This has led to questions about fairness, because However, knock-on impacts could be felt over wide areas. For example, crop failures linked to extreme weather could raise food prices across the globe. to limit global warming, the IPCC says.

An honorary doctorate of science (PhD) that Mr Ross was awarded from the University of Edinburgh University in November 2024 acknowledged his childhood discoveries. Edinburgh University paleontologist Prof Steve Brusatte worked with Mr Ross, who was also known as Dougie, for more than a decade. He told BBC Naidheachdan: ""Dougie really was Scotland's dinosaur guy."" When Mr Ross was a teenager he built and ran a museum in Staffin, in north-east Skye. His collection at the time included ammonites, marine animals with a coiled shell. Over the years, he was involved in work to uncover further dinosaur footprints and helped to extract bones. Often, he was to be found taking groups of school children, tourists and experts to seaside fossil site across the island. He was also deeply involved with preserving local history as a director of Staffin Community Trust. Sìne Gillespie, who worked with Mr Ross as part of the trust, said he was among the most knowledgeable of the social and family histories of the area.

2025-10-28,Hillfort siege site excavations cleared to proceed,science,BBC,"The Scottish government has cleared the way for an archaelogical dig to shed more light on the story of a Roman siege of a British hillfort. The victory at Burnswark Hill near Lockerbie in 140AD is considered to be one of Rome's greatest military triumphs north of Hadrian's Wall. A new dig will aim to establish whether siege works at the site were a genuine military engagement or a training exercise. A Scottish government planner concluded the work did not need further scrutiny by ministers and could be cleared to Historic Environment Scotland (HES) which has said it is minded to grant scheduled monument consent. Burnswark Hill originates from the early Iron Age - about 800BC - and was defended by earth ramparts and contained timber roundhouses.

2025-10-29,Sir David Attenborough backs bid to buy estate,science,BBC,"Sir David Attenborough has championed a bid by conservationists to raise £30m to buy the entirety of a vast upland estate. The Wildlife Trusts and Northumberland Wildlife Trust are attempting to complete the purchase of the Rothbury Estate, a 15-sq-mile (38.8-sq-km) tract of former grouse moor, woodland and farmland, with plans to boost wildlife, restore bogs and promote nature-friendly farming. With a year to go to raise the £30m needed to secure the entire estate, or risk it being broken up and sold off, Sir David has urged people to back the bid. In a video, the naturalist and broadcaster said time was running out to save Rothbury Estate. It is the largest area of land to be put on sale in England in decades and sits in the heart of what nature experts said could be a 40-mile (64km) ""wild"" corridor, stretching from the coast to Kielder and the Scottish border, and includes the Simonside Hills Rothbury Estate was owned by the Duke of Northumberland's youngest son, Lord Max Percy, and had been in the family for about 700 years. The partnership between Northumberland Wildlife Trust and the Wildlife Trusts was given two years in October 2024 to raise the £30m needed to buy all of the estate. Sir David said: ""People know and love the Simonside Hills that rise here, they walk the ridges and listen for the calls of the curlew, they watch for red squirrels and admire the views as they scramble among the crags. ""They walk along its remote paths and marvel at the astonishing rock carvings left by our distant ancestors, who once lived here."" He said the Wildlife Trusts would work with local farmers and communities who lived and worked at Rothbury to care for the area, breathe new life into its habitats and create a place where people and nature could thrive side by side. ""Please help us make this vision a reality,"" he added. About £8m, in donations ranging from £5 to £5m, has already been raised, but the race is on to secure the remaining two thirds. A fundraising appeal has been launched online. Northumberland Wildlife Trust chief executive Mike Pratt said the purchase was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to do something meaningful for nature at a large scale through restoring and protecting habitat and increasing access to the countryside. The estate is home to rare wildlife, including curlew, mountain bumblebees, lapwings, red squirrels, cuckoo and merlin, as well as Atlantic salmon and critically endangered eels, but the conservationists say nature could be richer still. Their plans include bringing in large herbivores including ponies, hardy cattle and eventually even bison to graze the land naturally, and there are hopes pine martens, beavers and golden eagles could recolonise the landscape. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Craig Bennett, CEO of the Wildlife Trusts said the Rothbury Estate was the biggest piece of land to come on the market in England for more than 30 years - and is larger than the city of York. ""That's why it's such a unique opportunity,"" he said. ""We know that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and I've had enough in my lifetime of looking at lots of graphs that point nature going downwards. ""We want to bend the curve on that and start to bring nature back at scale."" The trusts said local people would benefit from greater access to the estate, with potential for building new paths, developing a visitor and education centre and creating new jobs. Mr Pratt described the Rothbury Estate as sitting in an area which could be a ""special area for nature recovery"" - the only opportunity of that scale in England. ""It's got a fantastic and interesting landscape already but when you look in detail a lot of the finer biodiversity, like everywhere else, is not there as it should be,"" he said. ""It represents a great canvas to restore nature in that beautiful landscape.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0x39x270o

Photovolt Development Partners (PVPD) has offered £441,000 per year to local community groups located nearby the proposed 1,000 hectare (2,471 acre) farm. Sustainable Woodstock said the annual payment should be around £4.2m, citing a suggesting developers could pay communities £5,000 per megawatt (MW) per year. PVPD said it was committed to ensuring ""the project delivers real, lasting benefits where they are most needed"". Colin Carritt, a former Town Mayor of Woodstock, said: ""It beggars belief that... our communities should walk away from this once in a generation opportunity to secure a substantial cash settlement. ""Accepting the £441,000 per annum over the 40 year lifetime of this project would mean that £150m of benefits would be lost to communities."" He added that accepting the offer would also ""damage the attitude and acceptance towards these and future developments"". Hilary Brown from Sustainable Woodstock said: ""It is alarming to hear that a mere £441,000 a year is a reportedly satisfactory amount for Oxfordshire's communities, when they might expect £4m a year or more."" The MP for Bicester and Woodstock, Calum Miller, said he was ""disappointed"" with PVPD's engagement with local groups and was pressing the firm on the issue. ""The offer they've made is well below the one the government's recently consulted on,"" he said. ""There has to be a real benefit to local communities so people can see why nationally significant projects are taking place on their doorstep."" But Richard Devereux-Cooke, chair of a group of local parish councils, said the total was a ""reasonable"" amount for a community benefit fund. ""But that depends on whether or not the project goes ahead, and if the developer chooses to pay anything at all,"" he said. Oxfordshire County Council said it ""shared local frustrations"" that community benefit was not a statutory requirement for solar farms. ""Although we have done our best to get the most benefit for the community, we cannot force the developer to provide any specific amount of funding,"" it said. ""In the end, it is the developer who makes the final decision."" West Oxfordshire District Council said it was working on getting community groups the ""best deal possible"". Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is expected to make a final decision on Botley West in 2026. In a statement PVPD said the £441,000 commitment had been made ""on an entirely voluntary basis"". ""This fund will be made available in addition to roughly £1.6m per year generated in business rates, at least half of which will be received by relevant local authorities,"" it said. ""This means that, in all, at least £49.64m will be directly invested in the local area over the solar farm's lifespan, as a result of the project.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l74jz6w34o

The not-profit social enterprise said it rejected £4,825 from South West Water (SWW), accusing it of prioritising shareholders above investment to stop pollution. SWW said it was disappointed not to support Little Green Change but was ""serious about reducing pollution"" - investing £760m over the next five years to reduce the use of storm overflows. In a Facebook post, Little Green Change said it had been ""delighted"" to receive the funding notification from ActionFunder - a platform matching business grants with non-profit organisations. It said the amount was ""significant"" as its income for the last financial year was £21,000. But it added that SWW's outdated infrastructure resulted in ""regular pumping of sewage into rivers and the ocean, including the River Lim in Lyme Regis... causing significant damage to the water ecosystem, all while they continue to raise bills for their customers"". Ecologist Graham Roberts, of the River Lim Action Group, said: ""In these times of austerity and the difficulty of finding funding for projects, we commend any organisation, including Little Green Change, that turns down funding from any source that does not have the necessary environmental credentials. ""Unfortunately, too many companies jump on the bandwagon of self-promotion by offering small grants elsewhere, when they clearly do not have their own house in order."" SWW said it would reallocate the money from its Better Futures Fund, which is offering £2.5m to community groups over the next five years. Events co-ordinator Kristy Poulton said the company had made great strides towards reducing pollution.

Milton Keynes University Hospital will be the first place in the city to benefit from the heat network by developers 1Energy. It involves taking wasted heat from data centres and from an energy centre located in the north of the city that will be powered by heat pumps. Jeremy Bungey, executive director of 1Energy, said their mission was to de-carbonise heat and the was ""a vital step in that journey"". The project has received £17.6m in funding from the government's Green Heat Network Fund and has secured more than £78m of private capital. Tony Marsh, director of estates and facilities at Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""This partnership will allow us to cut carbon emissions significantly while ensuring our heating infrastructure is resilient and future-ready."" 1Energy said 100 gigawatt hours of energy would be generated through the network each year, equivalent to the heat needed for 20,000 homes. It will initially heat 74 large buildings by the end of 2027 with longer term ambitions to start heating households. The developer said the Milton Keynes Energy Network would help to cut customers' reliance on fossil fuels while supporting both the NHS and the city's ambitions to reduce net carbon emissions to zero. It said the scheme would cut 15,000 tonnes of emissions a year - the equivalent of planting 238,000 trees - because of the 75% reduction in heating emissions for the connected buildings, compared to gas boilers. Mr Bungey said that as well as delivering efficient, low-carbon heating it was ""an example of how we can re-purpose waste heat into community value, powering a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future."" The energy centre that will help to provide heat to the network will be located adjacent to Linford Wood.

Simon Clarke, head of nature recovery for the trust, spoke to BBC Radio Somerset to answer your questions. Mr Clarke said the project was ""about restoring balance to our woodland ecosystem"", which pine martens were a critical part of before their woodland habitat was lost and they were hunted for fur. He said the animals fed on fruit, especially in the autumn, which helped the surrounding environment. ""They'll be spreading the seeds, you'll have new plants growing. They are an important part of our woodland flora,"" he explained. If pine martens are not eating berries, they can feed on small mammals like voles. But Mr Clarke said other mammals had adapted to their presence over the years. ""Red squirrels for example are adapted to pine martens, they're smaller, lighter and faster,"" he said. ""Whereas grey squirrels aren't adapted to them - so actually it could be beneficial to red squirrels,"" he added. Another concern raised was whether pine martens would endanger nesting birds. However, Mr Clarke said birds usually nested away from woodlands. ""Pine martens, they want to live in woodlands. It's unusual for them to go away from woodlands, that's not where their food sources are,"" he said. And for people with poultry, Mr Clarke suggested managing the canopy above the area birds are kept in so pine martens would not have branches to climb.

George Powell, of no fixed abode, failed to repay £600,000, the money a judge had earlier decided was his share of the missing coins and jewellery dug up from a Herefordshire field. He was arrested in Devon on suspicion of a separate charge of causing grievous bodily harm and then jailed for five years and three months at Plymouth Magistrates Court on 23 October for failing to repay the money. Powell, along with Layton Davies, uncovered about 300 Viking coins in a field in 2015 but did not declare the treasure, instead selling it to dealers. They were convicted of theft and concealing their find, with Powell jailed for 10 years and Davies, for eight-and-a-half. Powell had been released on licence after serving half of his sentence. The huge collection of jewellery Powell and Davies uncovered was one of the biggest treasure finds in British history. The items, which included a gold ring, a bracelet with a dragon's head clasp, a crystal rock pendant, silver ingot and a collection of coins had been buried by Vikings in the ninth century and been hidden for 1,100 years. One particular coin showed that King Coenwulf of Mercia and King Alfred of Wessex ruled together in an alliance – something previously unknown. If they had followed the law, and declared the treasure they would have become very wealthy men. In 2019, at Worcester Crown Court, Powell, whose address at that time was given as Newport, and Davies were convicted of theft and concealing the find. Judge Nicholas Cartright said they had stolen ""from the nation"". Just 31 of the estimated 300 coins they found had been recovered at the time of the trial. In 2021, they were back at Worcester Crown Court for a proceeds of crime hearing where they told the court different accounts of where the coins were. They said only a few dozen coins had been found; that the hoard was dug up somewhere else and moved to Herefordshire; and that the coins had been sold to unknown buyers via an auction house in Austria. The judge rejected their claims and said he believed around 270 coins were still being deliberately hidden by them. They were both given a confiscation order and told to repay £600,000 or return to jail. Davies, from Pontypridd, was ordered to serve an extra five years and three months in prison for failing to pay his share. Powell tried to appeal but his attempts to stay out of prison were rejected by an appeal judge and also the Court of Appeal in London. He was due to be sentenced at Birmingham Magistrates Court on 8 January but he failed to appear, so a warrant was issued for his arrest. Despite police appeals, he remained on the run until his arrest in Paignton, Devon on 22 October. He told the police that his name was George Whittaker but police soon realised it was an alias and there was a warrant out for his arrest for failing to appear in court for the hoard charges. Devon and Cornwall Police said the charge of GBH followed an alleged incident in the Grange Road area of Paignton on 18 October in which a man sustained a serious head injury. He is due to appear at Exeter Crown Court on November 20th for the charge of GBH. Photos taken by Powell and Davies when they dug up the hoard in 2015 showed an estimated 300-plus coins in a freshly-dug hole, but only a few dozen have been found. In May 2023, two further men, Craig Best, from County Durham, and Roger Pilling, from Lancashire, were each jailed for five years and two months after trying to sell 44 rare Anglo-Saxon coins worth £766,000. The coins were thought to be part of the hoard uncovered in Herefordshire. In May 2025, another coin believed to be part of the hoard was found on sale in Croydon. Police believe the rest, about 240 coins, are in the hands of organised crime gangs across the world.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dkv8pde9o

She denied the claim that slots can only be reserved up to two weeks in advance and that the trial assumes digital access, stating that a telephone booking service was also available. In an additional statement provided by the council, Bramhall said: ""We've seen booking systems at CRCs introduced by councils in other areas of the country with great success and would like to trial a system of our own."" The councillor accepted that ""historically, congestion has been less of an issue at Lyne CRC"" but added that there would still be times where queues develop at the site. The trial has proven very effective in managing congestion at the ""well-used and busy"" Camberley CRC, she added. or WhatsApp us on 08081 002250.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr07xjyg3po
2025-10-27,What are 'leaky dams' and how do they   stop floods?,science,BBC,"As autumn gets under way and the rain starts coming down, communities across Gloucestershire are preparing for potential floods. Rivers are being monitored, sandbags are being stacked up and natural flood defences are being created. Shropshire Wildlife Trust has been making ""leaky dams"" to slow the flow of water downstream – this involves placing branches and twigs across small waterways – to try to reduce flooding in Gloucestershire. All this work comes as the Environmental Audit Committee has called on the government to set up a national flood service for expert help and clear accountability. Shropshire Wildlife Trust has been building the dams in the River Teme catchment area. The river snakes through Shropshire and Worcestershire before joining the River Severn. Scientists from Cardiff University have been monitoring the water flow in the Teme. They found an additional 100 cubic metres (3,531 cubic feet) of water is stored per dam. This meant the dams slowly released 10 million litres of water (two million gallons) over the course of a week, preventing it from rushing downstream. ""We think that we can roll this out at such a large scale across really big catchments that we can begin to impact and reduce flooding in places like Worcester and Gloucester,"" said Luke Neal, from the trust. The dams are also being created in Gloucestershire – for example, in Newent and Cannop in the Forest of Dean, Uley near Stroud, and Abbeymead in Gloucester. Gloucestershire County Council is working on a new catchment prioritisation exercise to work out which areas need more natural flood barriers. For those on the front line of flooding, the impact can be devastating. Caroline Price's home was flood in January 2024. She had to live in temporary accommodation for more than six months while repairs took place. ""There's nothing you can do to stop it and within 12 hours it [the water] was a foot up,"" Mrs Price said. She added: ""Looking back on it now, the devastation was pretty dramatic."" Despite the upheaval, like many in Tewkesbury, Ms Price believes flooding is a risk that has to be accepted when living so close to two major rivers – the Severn and the Avon. ""Floods happen in Tewkesbury, they're always going to happen, they always have happened, you take a view on that and you kind of have to live with it to a certain extent,"" she said. As prevention work to determine the best places to slow the pace of the river is under way, flood wardens and parish councillors are keeping an eye on river levels. If there is a surge, an alert will be sent out to the wardens, who will then warn those likely to be affected. Christopher Byers is a flood warden in the village of Longford – which was hit badly by flooding in January 2024 – and is vice chair of Longford Parish Council. ""We have around 600 empty sand bags and around two metres cubed of grit, all in storage ready to use,"" he said. Longford and the surrounding areas have seen a lot of development in recent years which Mr Byers feels has changed the way the flooding happens and puts pressure on the system. Earlier this month, the Environmental Audit Committee, which scrutinises government work, produced a report looking at flood resilience in England. It found many communities still do not know who is responsible for managing flood risk where they live and there is no single line of accountability, which undermines trust, delays response and obstructs long term planning. It named unchecked development as one of the reasons for flooding, along with changing weather patterns driven by climate change, and ageing infrastructure. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said it was investing more than £10.5bn in new flood defences but would consider the committee's recommendations. ""This government inherited defences in the worst condition on record and has immediately put money into maintenance and repairs as well as delivering 151 flood schemes, safeguarding more than 24,000 properties,"" a government spokesperson said. But the spokesperson said ""more action is needed"" and added officials are looking at ""a simpler and transparent approach"" to make it easier to build defences.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cder002gg0xo
2025-10-27,Students prepare to compete in 'robotics Olympics',science,BBC,"A south London school has qualified for an international ""Olympics-style"" robotics competition, in what it claims is a first. Young people from Langley Park School for Boys in Beckenham won the UK Championships earlier this year and will head to Panama City on 29 October to represent Britain in the Teams from 190 different countries will be represented at the event. Maths teacher Matt Fry, who introduced robotics to the school when he started there two years ago, said being the first comprehensive school to represent Great Britain at the international event made him want to encourage other schools to take part. Adrian, who is part of the robotics team, said: ""In two years, we've come so far. None of us thought when we started that we would become the UK champions and represent our country in a global competition."" Reflecting on their win, he said: ""It was just so incredible - robotics has felt really life-changing. ""The journey that we've been on and how much we've learnt. I was just really proud that all our hard work paid off."" He said he and his friends signed up to Mr Fry's robotics club two years ago. ""None of us knew much about the competition,"" he said. ""We actually turned up to our first competition and lost quite badly. ""But after that we bounced back and just put everything into it - and then we did really well."" Looking ahead to the competition in Panama City, fellow team member Kieran said: ""Meeting new people from all around the world is something that I would never have dreamed of when starting robotics as a school. ""Doing it with my friends means a lot to me - and now to get a chance to compete abroad is something that we could never have dreamed of. ""When you overcome new problems and new challenges, you feel so much satisfaction - it's just been an incredible experience."" Each year the First Global Challenge sets teams tasks based around real-world problems. This year the theme is sustainable food networks. Kieran said: ""I think we can do well. We're definitely there to try our best, learn from other people's teams, especially because it's our first time competing globally."" Another student, Teddy, thanked Mr Fry for introducing the group to robotics. ""Mr Fry is like a god in our eyes, he's just taken this programme, given it to us and look where we are now - we're going to Panama,"" he said. ""Without him, none of this would have ever happened. We can only say 'thank you'."" Mr Fry said he introduced the club after witnessing its potential for young people. ""I love them to be making decisions,"" he said. ""The robot is almost the smallest part of this, it's the leadership, it's the project-managing, it's all manner of different things. ""The fact that we're the first comprehensive school to go, it just feels like we can open doors. ""We're approaching other schools and saying, 'if we can, you can'.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30vpdry9e1o
2025-10-25,Record number of finds at Roman fort dig,science,BBC,"A record number of discoveries have been made at a Roman fort during the fifth consecutive year of an archaeological dig. This year, 47 volunteers and 24 archaeology students from Newcastle University spent weeks unearthing artifacts at Bremenium Fort in High Rochester, Northumberland. Two historically ""significant"" intaglios - possibly from rings - were found along with Roman pottery, military items, jewellery and a bronze lamp. Barry Mead, who discovered a rare intaglio on the first day of the dig, said the most exciting part of the experience was being the ""first person to see any of the items I dig up in 1,800 years"". Mr Mead, who lives in Druridge Bay, has been part of the excavation efforts for the last five years. Richard Carlton, who has overseen archaeology at the site, said among the artifacts found were two intaglios, which were ""probably signet ring inserts"" and of ""exceptional quality"". One shows a scene of grape harvesting, which he said was ""thought to be unique"" in Britain and northern Europe but ""with several parallels"" in Dalmatia (Modern Croatia) and northern Italy. ""It seems likely that the gem reflects the likely origin of the wearer who may have come from the Mediterranean,"" he added. He said the discoveries made by volunteers in 2025 confirmed the ""special status"" of Bremenium Fort. The National Lottery Heritage Fund contributed nearly £50,000 towards the costs of running the dig, as well as Newcastle University and Redesdale Archaeology Group (RAG). Bob Jackson, of RAG, who has overseen multiple seasons at the site, added: ""This year's finds are exceptional, in both quantity and quality. ""The range of pottery and metalwork, especially the amphora and the intact brooches, offer new insights into trade, craftsmanship, and daily life at Bremenium. ""It's a privilege to work with such a committed team."" There are plans to return to the site next year to further explore the fort.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dr4ldwj02o
2025-10-27,Machines that pay users to recycle adopted by city,science,BBC,"A scheme that rewards people for disposing of bottles and cans in a reverse vending machine has been adopted by another city. The device, which offers financial incentives on a mobile app in return for using it to recycle, has been installed at Parkside Pools and Gym in Cambridge. by West Suffolk Council, which has introduced seven Trovr machines in Newmarket, Bury St Edmunds and Haverhill over the past year. Councillor Rosy Moore from Cambridge City Council said: ""We are always keen to try out new ways of capturing recyclable packaging that could otherwise end up as litter or in landfill."" The pilot scheme was spearheaded by Newmarket North councillor Janne Jarvis, who has been working to introduce it to other parts of the UK. Speaking in March, he said it had been ""tremendously successful"" in Suffolk and believed Cambridge would be the ""perfect place"" for its expansion. The system works by people bringing single-use drink containers to a Trovr machine, which then verifies them as recyclable and credits points to an app. These points can be redeemed for online discounts, entry into cash giveaways or with participating local businesses. Reverse vending machines like these are set to become more common in the UK as the government brings in As part of this, retailers will charge a small deposit for plastic and aluminium drinks containers, which consumers will be able to redeem by recycling them. Trovr CEO Nick Yeatman said: ""By placing our machine at Parkside Pools and Gym, we're helping the community turn everyday recycling into a positive action that benefits both people and the planet.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmx3g4vlzvo

2025-10-26,Solar farm size of 130 football pitches approved,science,BBC,"A solar farm the size of 130 football pitches has been given the go-ahead after a councillor said it was ""inevitable"" it would be approved on appeal. Applicant RWE Renewables said the 214-acre plot at Pickwell near Melton Mowbray would power more than 25,000 homes. But the site is split over two council areas. Melton Borough Council (MBC) approved the larger site, but a smaller portion of the development is in neighbouring Rutland  and still up for consideration by the respective council. The planning committee voted in favour of approving the scheme, with six voting for and four against. The MBC application had attracted 229 letters of support, against 53 objections, the But the meeting heard the letters of support were largely as a result of a form given out to residents by RWE Renewables, which led to accusations from an objector that supporters were not local. This claim was refuted by both the applicant and the council. Councillor James Mason said he had ""agonised"" over the solar farm decision for days, but added it would be ""inevitable that this solar farm will get built on appeal"". Ward councillor Leigh Higgins called the farm ""industrial infrastructure and an alien feature imposed on open countryside"". But the applicant defended the project and said the farmland would return in 40 years' time with ""an improved soil condition"", and added renewable energy was a ""national need, not a local need"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17pr7qr5l5o

The house was one of those built at Sidlesham, near Chichester, by the Land Settlement Association (LSA). Founded in 1934, the LSA provided two-up two-down homes along with four acres of land to be used as smallholdings by families who wanted to escape poverty in Britain's industrial cities. The Weald and Downland Living Museum has the deconstructed building in storage and plans to re-erect it on the museum site. Sidlesham was the largest LSA site in the country, with its history explored in a BBC Sounds episode of Although the LSA closed in 1983, in West Sussex's market gardening industry. The museum hopes to reconstruct the building in 2026 and open it to the public in 2027, when it will be used as an education centre. Curator Julian Bell said: ""In terms of architecture it's not outstanding, but what it represents is the social history of the area south of Chichester, giving visitors an idea of why it is still today a big market gardening area.""

2025-10-26,New wetland area created at city wildlife reserve,science,BBC,"It might look like a muddy patch of wasteland, but a nature reserve that sits between Derby County's Pride Park stadium and the River Derwent has been turned into a suitable breeding habitat for ground-nesting birds. Derby City Council has spent £43,237.01 on creating plots of short vegetation, bare soil, gravelled areas and permanent water pools at the Sanctuary Bird and Wildlife Reserve. The work has created areas favoured for breeding by various species including the lapwing, blackcap, plover, blackcap, sand martin, reed bunting, and skylark. It is hoped the project will turn the area into one of the most significant in the region for breeding birds. The Sanctuary Bird and Wildlife Reserve was established on former industrial land in 2004 and is one of 10 designated local nature reserves in Derby. The work to create the breeding habitats has been funded through the council's Our City, Our River scheme and section 106 funding contributions from construction companies to mitigate a new development's impact on a local area. The area is not open to the public, but there are several viewing points, two with disabled access, which can be accessed from the Derby Arena car park. Councillor Ndukwe Onuoha, Derby City Council cabinet member for streetpride, parks and leisure, said: ""This exciting habitat project demonstrates our commitment to biodiversity and the local environment, creating a unique habitat in the city that supports the recovery of beautiful and vulnerable ground-nesting birds. ""This investment in The Sanctuary ensures that Derby's green spaces not only survive but actively thrive as crucial stopovers and breeding grounds for a wide range of birds."" Nick Moyes, who initiated the creation of The Sanctuary, said: ""The Sanctuary is one of Derby's least known spaces for wildlife, yet its location close to the city centre, and its valuable habitats for many unusual visiting and breeding bird species, make this particular local nature reserve one of the most important in the region.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lpz0l1x91o

Endolys Ltd has pledged to invest up to £120m in the region after taking over the former Cleveland Bridge site in Darlington. The chemical recycling company said it will create up to 120 jobs with the installation of pyrolysis oil production units at the Yarm Road facility. Micahel Fox, CEO of Endolys, said the project would ""create high quality jobs"" at the site which had an ""excellent building"". Councillor Chris McEwan, Darlington Borough Council's cabinet member for the economy, said it was a ""significant step forward"". ""It marks a proud moment in the town's journey toward a cleaner, greener future,"" he said. Endolys said £60m had already been secured for the first phase of the development, which will involve six units processing 60,000 tonnes of shredded plastic film waste into 40,000 tonnes of pyrolysis oil each year. During the second phase, costing a similar amount, a further 60,000 tonnes of film waste would be processed into 40,000 tonnes of oil, the All of the waste will be sourced from municipal waste facilities. Subject to planning and environmental approvals, phase one operations are expected to begin at the end of 2026. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he hoped the plant ""will breathe new life into the iconic former Cleveland Bridge site"". ""As well as creating scores of well-paid, good-quality, skilled jobs, it will also put our region at the forefront of innovation in recycling and clean growth,"" he said. Matt Vickers, MP for Stockton West, said: ""This is fantastic news for Teesside. ""It means more jobs and opportunities for local people, the arrival of world-leading technology in our region, and the regeneration of the former Cleveland Bridge site.""

2025-10-26,'Hidden' environmental impact of deepfake videos,science,BBC,"You can barely scroll through social media at the moment without seeing deepfake videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Platforms, such as Open AI's Sora, have gone viral due to their ability to make hyper-realistic videos, leading to people sharing faked scenes of deceased celebrities and historical figures in bizarre and often offensive scenarios. The videos have even forced the families of deceased figures, , to appeal to AI firms to ban their loved-ones from featuring. But behind the emotional impact of the deepfakes, a lecturer at the University of Oxford is now warning about their environmental footprint. Dr Kevin Grecksch explained that there was ""quite a huge hidden impact on the environment"" because ""somewhere these videos have to be produced - and that's typically not on your phone"". ""It happens in a data centre which could be somewhere across the world, or maybe just around the corner, you never know,"" he said. ""First of all that uses up a lot of electricity and secondly it uses a lot of water."" Data centres use large amounts of fresh water to cool servers on an industrial level scale. The new apps make it easy for users to post videos they have created to social media, and has resulted in a deluge of videos on social feeds. Earlier this month, Sora was downloaded more than a million times in less than five days - with the app still topping the Apple App Store charts in the US. But Dr Grecksch warned that people should be ""mindful"" of the platforms environmental impact. ""There's a lot of water involved and I think we just need to think about what we're using it for, how we're using it, and how often we're using it,"" he said. He said the ""cat was out of the sack"" with regards to AI, but urged people to have ""a little bit more integrated thinking around where we put  data centres and how we are cooling them"". ""The government sees south Oxfordshire as one of the first AI growth areas, but that's a massive problem because apparently no one has thought where the water is going to come from that's going to cool down those servers.""

2025-10-26,Weekly round-up: Stories you may have missed,science,BBC,"A kitten trapped in a police car wheel arch, a topless swimmer and Japanese art from bamboo were among the stories you may have missed this week. We have selected six articles from the past seven days for Devon and Cornwall. An organisation supporting film productions in Devon , building a comprehensive database to attract more productions to the region. From windswept moors to chocolate-box villages, the film office is working to ensure Devon's landscapes are front and centre in the UK's screen industry. Recent high-profile productions such as a Harry Potter TV series have already demonstrated the county's appeal. Claire Horrocks, who leads the initiative for Screen Devon, said the goal was to make it easier for producers to find the perfect backdrop for their stories. Experts in Japanese bamboo crafting The tradition of takezaiku - which translates as ""bamboo craft"" - has been used for centuries to create items ranging from chopsticks to entire bridges. The team from Japan has been exploring the giant bamboo groves at Trebah Gardens, near Falmouth, and demonstrating how they select and cut the right canes for their intricate woven designs. It was hoped the results of the Cornish collaboration could be selected to be shown at the 2026 RHS Chelsea Flower Show, project leaders said.

2025-10-25,'Brothers in the forest' - the fight to protect an isolated Amazon tribe,science,BBC,"Tomas Chavez Loma was working in a small clearing in the Peruvian Amazon, when he heard footsteps approaching in the forest. He realised he was surrounded, and froze. ""One was standing, aiming with an arrow,"" he says. ""And somehow he noticed I was here and I started to run."" He had come face to face with the Mashco Piro. For decades, Tomas - who lives in the small village of Nueva Oceania - had been practically a neighbour to these nomadic people, who shun contact with outsiders. However, until very recently, he had rarely seen them. The Mashco Piro have chosen to be cut off from the world for more than a century. They hunt with long bows and arrows, relying on the Amazonian rainforest for everything they need. ""They started circling and whistling, imitating animals, many different types of birds,"" Tomas recalls. ""I kept saying: 'Nomole' (brother). Then they gathered, they felt closer, so we headed toward the river and ran."" A new report by the human rights organisation, . The Mashco Piro is believed to be the largest. The report says half of these groups could be wiped out in the next decade if governments don't do more to protect them. It claims the biggest risks are from logging, mining or drilling for oil. Uncontacted groups are extremely vulnerable to basic disease - as such, the report says a threat is posed by contact with evangelical missionaries and social media influencers looking for clicks. Recently, Mashco Piro people have been coming to Nueva Oceania more and more, according to locals. The village is a fishing community of seven or eight families, sitting high on the banks of the Tauhamanu River in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, 10 hours from the nearest settlement by boat. The area is not recognised as a protected reserve for uncontacted groups, and logging companies operate here. Tomas says that, at times, the noise of logging machinery can be heard day and night, and the Mashco Piro people are seeing their forest disturbed and destroyed. In Nueva Oceania, people say they are conflicted. They fear the Mashco Piro's arrows but they also have deep respect for their ""brothers"" who live in the forest and want to protect them. ""Let them live as they live, we can't change their culture. That's why we keep our distance,"" says Tomas. The people in Nueva Oceania are worried about the damage to the Mascho Piro's livelihood, the threat of violence and the possibility that loggers might expose the Mashco Piro to diseases they have no immunity to. While we were in the village, the Mashco Piro made their presence felt again. Letitia Rodriguez Lopez, a young mother with a two-year-old daughter, was in the forest picking fruit when she heard them. ""We heard shouting, cries from people, many of them. As if there were a whole group shouting,"" she told us. It was the first time she had encountered the Mashco Piro and she ran. An hour later, her head was still pounding from fear. ""Because there are loggers and companies cutting down the forest they're running away, maybe out of fear and they end up near us,"" she said. ""We don't know how they might react to us. That's what scares me."" In 2022, two loggers were attacked by the Mashco Piro while fishing. One was hit by an arrow to the gut. He survived, but the other man was found dead days later with nine arrow wounds in his body. The Peruvian government has a policy of non-contact with isolated people, making it illegal to initiate interactions with them. The policy originated in Brazil after decades of campaigning by indigenous rights groups, who saw that initial contact with isolated people lead to entire groups being wiped out by disease, poverty and malnutrition. In the 1980s, when the Nahau people in Peru made initial contact with the world outside, 50% of their population died within a matter of years. In the 1990s, the Muruhanua people faced the same fate. ""Isolated indigenous peoples are very vulnerable - epidemiologically, any contact could transmit diseases, and even the simplest ones could wipe them out,"" says Isrrail Aquise from the Peruvian indigenous rights group, Femanad. ""Culturally too, any contact or interference can be very harmful to their life and health as a society."" For the neighbours of uncontacted tribes, the reality of no-contact can be tricky. As Tomas shows us around the forest clearing where he encountered the Mashco Piro, he stops, whistles through his hands and then waits in silence. ""If they answer, we turn back,"" he says. All we can hear is the chatter of insects and birds. ""They're not here."" Tomas feels the government has left the residents of Nueva Oceania to handle a tense situation by themselves. He plants food in his garden for the Mashco Piro to take. It is a safety measure he and other villagers have come up with to help their neighbours and protect themselves. ""I wish I knew the words to say, 'Here have these plantains, it's a gift,'"" he adds. ""'You can take them freely. Don't shoot me.'"" Almost 200km south-east on the other side of the dense forest, the situation is very different. There, by the Manu River, the Mashco Piro live in an area that is officially recognised as a forest reserve. The Peruvian Ministry of Culture and Fenamad run the ""Nomole"" control post here, staffed by eight agents. It was set up in 2013 when conflict between Mashco Piro and local villages resulted in several killings. As the head of the control post, Antonio Trigoso Ydalgo's job is to stop that from happening again. The Mashco Piro appear regularly, sometimes several times a week. They are a different group of people from those near Nueva Oceania, and the agents don't believe they know each other. ""They always come out at the same place. That's where they shout from,"" Antonio says, pointing across the wide Manu River to a small shingly beach on the other side. They ask for plantain, yucca or sugar cane. ""If we don't answer, they sit there all day waiting,"" Antonio says. The agents try to avoid that, in case tourists or local boats pass by. So they usually comply. The control post has a small garden they grow food in. When it runs out, they ask a local village for supplies. If these aren't available, the agents ask the Mashco Piro to come back in a few days' time. It has worked so far, and there has been little conflict recently. There are about 40 people who Antonio sees regularly - men, women and children from several different families. They name themselves after animals. The chief is called Kamotolo (Honey Bee). The agents say he is a stern man and never smiles. Another leader, Tkotko (Vulture) is more of a joker, he laughs a lot and makes fun of the agents. There is a young woman called Yomako (Dragon) who the agents say has a good sense of humour too. The Mashco Piro don't seem to have much interest in the outside world but are interested in the personal lives of the agents they meet. They ask about their families and where they live. When one agent was pregnant and went on maternity leave, they brought a rattle made from the throat of a howler monkey for the baby to play with. They are interested in the agents' clothes, especially sports clothes in red or green.  ""When we approach, we put on old, torn clothes with missing buttons - so they don't take them,"" Antonio says. ""Before, they wore their own traditional clothing - very beautiful skirts made with threads from insect fibres that they crafted themselves. But now some of them, when tourist boats pass, receive clothes or boots."" says Eduardo Pancho Pisarlo, an agent at the control post. But any time the team ask about life in the forest, the Mashco Piro shut the conversation down. ""Once, I asked how they light their fires,"" says Antonio. ""They told me, 'You have wood, you know.' I insisted, and they said, 'You already have all these things - why do you want to know?'"" If someone doesn't appear for quite a while, the agents will ask where they are. If the Mashco Piro say, ""Don't ask"", they take it to mean that person has died. After years of contact, the agents still know little about how the Mashco Piro live or why they remain in the forest. It is believed they may be descended from indigenous people who fled into the deep jungle in the late 19th Century, escaping rampant exploitation and widespread massacres by so-called ""rubber barons"". Experts think the Mashco Piro may be closely related to the Yine, an indigenous people from south-eastern Peru. They speak an antiquated dialect of the same language, which the agents, who are also Yine, have been able to learn. But the Yine have long been river navigators, farmers and fishermen, while the Mashco Piro seem to have forgotten how to do these things. They may have become nomads and hunter-gatherers to stay safe. ""What I understand now is that they stay in one area for a while, set up a camp, and the whole family gather,"" says Antonio. ""Once they've hunted everything around that place, they move to another site."" Isrrail Aquise from Fenamad says more than 100 people have come out in front of the control post at various times. ""They ask for bananas and cassava to diversify their diet, but some families disappear for months or years after that,"" he says. ""They just say: 'I'm going away for a few moons, then I'll come back.' And they say goodbye."" The Mashco Piro in this area are well protected but the government is building a road which will connect it to an area where illegal mining is widespread. But it is clear to the agents that the Mashco Piro do not want to join the outside world. ""From my experience here at the post, they don't want to become 'civilised',"" Antonio says. ""Maybe the children do, as they grow up and see us wearing clothes, perhaps in 10 or 20 years. But the adults don't. They don't even want us here,"" he says. In 2016, a government bill was passed to extend the Mashco Piro's reserve to an area that would include Nueva Oceania. However, this has never been signed into law. ""We need them to be free like us,"" says Tomas. ""We know they lived very peacefully for years, and now their forests are being finished off - destroyed.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw92x915xlo
2025-10-24,Slater claims 'no reason' to expect UK to block recycling scheme,science,BBC,"Lorna Slater has told a court the Scottish government had no reason to expect UK ministers to block Holyrood's deposit return recycling scheme. The project collapsed in 2023 after a row over internal market rules, leading waste firm Biffa to sue for £50m in damages. The firm said Slater should have been up front about the risk posed by those rules when telling them of the government's unwavering commitment to the project. But she told the Court of Session she had expected problems to be resolved, because the whole of the UK was moving to set up similar schemes. Biffa initially claimed for more than £166m, including lost profits from a 10-year contract, but is now seeking £51.4m for the money it invested in infrastructure for the scheme. Biffa has said a letter from then minister Slater in May 2022 was ""foundational"" in its decision to sign a contract and ultimately invest tens of millions in infrastructure. The letter stated the government's ""unwavering"" commitment to launching the scheme on schedule in August 2023, and the firm said it was ""akin to a guarantee"". Slater told the court her letter to Biffa was not a project update, but that she had been asked to address specific points including the government's commitment to it - having recently delayed it by a year. She said she had invited the firm to ask any questions, and that they could have come back to ask about risks. She also said internal market rules were only one of a number of potentially existential risks to the scheme, but that the government was committed to working through them. Slater said the fact that the governments had recently agreed an internal markets deal for a ban on single-use plastics had shown that the process could be worked through, and that she did not think of it as an application which could be accepted or rejected. She said: ""There was no reason at all to expect the UK government to block the scheme. In fact it was in their interest to back it as a sort of pilot scheme so lessons could be learned for the rest of the UK. ""It wouldn't make the slightest bit of sense to hinder Scotland's DRS (deposit return scheme) when all nations of the UK were moving in the same direction."" Lorna Slater is due to continue her evidence on Tuesday. Former Scottish Secretary Alister Jack earlier told the court that the Scottish government was ""utterly irresponsible"" in encouraging firms to invest in its deposit return scheme. He said it had been clear to Scottish ministers for some time that the scheme would need an exclusion from the Internal Market Act, but they did not make a formal application until 2023. Lord Jack said writing to firms in 2022 voicing confidence in the scheme without mentioning risks was ""akin to building a house and then asking for planning permission"". The Scottish government has always insisted it was not to blame for the collapse of the plans and that it followed the proper processes around internal market rules. But Lord Jack told the court there was not a ""viable scheme"" until the point an exclusion to internal market rules had been granted. ""The letter may have been true in what it said but it was missing an awful lot of material facts that I think, as a politician and a businessman, were commercially sensitive in decision-making,"" he said. ""Irrespective of the process being followed, for me it was irresponsible not to tell companies that are spending money what the risks are, and there was no mention of risk. There was a huge level of risk and it was utterly irresponsible to send that letter."" The Scottish government has sought to play down the significance of the letter, and says the firm understood there were risks. It points to the fact Biffa had taken out a £20m insurance policy against any delay. Both then first minister Humza Yousaf and Slater accused Lord Jack of ""sabotaging"" the scheme when it collapsed in 2023. Lord Jack said the Scottish government should have asked for an exclusion from the Internal Market Act a year earlier when it was clear it was needed. ""I can't understand why they made such a hash of it,"" he said. ""The first minister had written letters, the minister for circular economy too, encouraging stakeholders to make financial commitments when they didn't have a viable scheme. ""Divergence was very clear from a very early stage. My responsibility was to protect free trade, consumers and business who were very concerned about this in relation to the economy."" Lord Jack said he was worried about ""massive inflation"" - more than 1,000 firms had written to him to voice concerns ""I wanted answers to these questions that were going to hit the economy, hit consumers and hit the least well off,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ex4161exo
2025-10-23,Wildlife trust sells woodland 'as resources low',science,BBC,"A wildlife trust has revealed it is going to sell a woodland to enable it to focus its ""limited resources"" on larger nature reserves. Herefordshire Wildlife Trust has confirmed the 4.5-hectare Merrivale Wood, is to be sold as part of a review of the trust's landholdings, which it says will ""ensure funds are targeted at conservation and nature recovery priorities"". The trust, which manages nearly 60 sites across the county, said looking after smaller reserves, like the wood outside Ross-on-Wye, had become ""very expensive"" to maintain. Now, local residents Jess and Jody Shaw have begun a campaign to keep the woodland open to public access, with the hope of raising the £90,000 to buy it. They launched a GoFundMe page this week and have so far raised just over £1,100. The estate agents handling the sale, Sutherlands, said the site would be delisted as a local nature reserve and access would only remain via an existing public footpath. The trust said it wanted to find a buyer who would ideally maintain the land as a nature reserve. The Shaws said that although hitting the target by the 30 October deadline was ""unlikely"", they hoped to demonstrate they could ""generate funds over a period of time and show them the benefit of maintaining the wood for community use"". Independent town councillor Daniel Lister, who is backing the campaign, said: ""It's ambitious, I know, but wouldn't it be great to get it into community ownership and keep the woodland open for everyone to carry on using? ""Under a private sale, they could stop the public walking through it. That would be a devastation."" The trust said it had been in touch with community representatives and welcomed their plans to submit a proposal, which its board would consider. Merrivale Wood is described by Sutherlands as ""hugely popular with the residents of the town"" and offering ""a fantastic opportunity to make the woodland a special visitor attraction"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xv4dqw01o
2025-10-24,Chicken rescued from bin after being left for dead,science,BBC,"A chicken found wrapped in a carrier bag and dumped in a public bin has been saved. The bird was discovered by refuse collector Richard Colgrave who was doing his round in Winchester at about 07:00 BST on Wednesday. His daughter Gemma Fullick-Colgrave said her father was ""disgusted"" and ""angered"" by the animal cruelty. After speaking with Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary and the RSPCA, she decided to give the bird to a local family friend who already kept chickens. She said her father was ""startled"" as he initially thought the animal was dead. He put it in his truck to ""try and warm it up"" and ""gave it a drink and some food"" while he carried on with his work. Mrs Fullick-Colgrave took the bird off her father's hands and said: ""She was very unwell, cold, her crest was very pale, and there was not really any life in her eyes. ""I think she was on the brink of death."" She appealed on social media to find the owner but she says she did not get a response. Louis Page, who has now taken the bird in, said he was ""glad to be rehoming this chick"", calling it ""another one to join the clan"". He said she had began to settle into her new home, adding: ""At first she was shy and not wanting to get along with the others but slowly she's getting more confident  and has started to move about and try some food."" A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: ""We are sad to hear that this chicken was abandoned this way and we are grateful to the member of the public who has kindly given the chicken a home. ""Sadly we are seeing rising numbers of animals being abandoned and are struggling with increasing numbers of animals coming into our care right now. , but like with any animal, they have specific behavioural and environmental requirements, and it's important that people have the appropriate time, knowledge and resources in place to be able to offer them a life-long home."" which showed reports of animal cruelty rose by a third across England and Wales in 2024.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9v1y9kex90o

2025-10-23,Can the plastic recycling industry be saved?,science,BBC,"In the plastic recycling industry, the casualties keep coming. Waste management company Biffa's Sunderland plant closed in February after opening in 2022 at a cost of £7m, while rival Viridor closed its Avonmouth plant in 2022, Skelmersdale in 2023 and confirmed this summer that its Rochester plant would close, too. Like falling dominoes, plastic recycling plant closures have been endemic across Europe too: another big name, Veolia, will close its two German operations this year, while seven plastic recyclers closed in the Netherlands last year. Meanwhile, companies Borealis, Dow and Neste to construct new plastic recycling plants in Europe. Industry body Plastic Recyclers Europe equates this to the loss of nearly of plastic recycling capacity since 2023. ""Without decisive political action, Europe will replace its recycling industry with dependency on unsustainable imports and growing volumes of waste, undermining both its economic resilience and its climate leadership,"" the organisation told the BBC in a statement. And more closures are likely, warns James McLeary, managing director for Biffa's polymers division, as the industry here and in Europe faces its most challenging year yet. High energy and labour costs here are two factors, in parallel with the fact that is currently cheaper than buying European recycled plastic. Plastic recycling plant closures , also prompted by the low price of virgin plastic, causing the country to miss its recycled content targets, as ""There's a big global dependence building on Asian plants, and we then have the situation where (plant operators in the UK and Europe) are going to make very tough decisions. Either they run their plants at a point where they're literally not making anything, or they decide to close,"" explains Mr McLeary, who is based in County Durham. A dependence on exporting plastic waste also hasn't helped. The UK exported around 600,000 tonnes of plastic waste last year, according to environmental analysts Loopholes in current UK legislation mean plastic waste collectors are inadvertently incentivised to export rather than process domestically. Meanwhile, manufacturers using plastic packaging are still inclined to use cheaper virgin plastic from abroad, and stomach being taxed for it. Ahmed Detta, CEO and founder of plastic waste recycler Enviroo, is frustrated by the flaws and contradictions that he feels are plaguing the industry and disrupting the goal of creating a circular economy that keeps materials in use for as long as possible. ""For me, a circular economy is a win-win. Every single person in that journey has to have some benefit, and that's not working,"" says Mr Detta, who is based in London. ""Brands aren't aligning with the circular economy. They're saying, 'why should I buy recycled material when it's cheaper for me to pay the fine for the plastics packaging tax, than actually pay for recycled materials? No one is saying, 'let's unite'."" So concerned is RECOUP, a UK-based plastic recycling independent authority, that its head of policy and infrastructure, Steve Morgan, warns: ""We are almost witnessing the demise of plastic recycling as we know it, unless we have some interventions. There's no way a lot of recyclers in the UK can compete."" UK regulations have benefited foreign markets more than they have the UK, and serious reform is needed, Mr Morgan argues. ""There are an awful lot of fantastic technologies developing. But it's a scale up of those and how they can actually make money, to continue to exist and then also thrive, is the secondary thing,"" says Mr Morgan, who is based in Peterborough. ""The commercial viability long term is just not there at the moment. There are some really good people producing technologies that we couldn't even dream of 10 years ago. But I just feel we're not going to see any real change in the next two to three years without some intervention."" RECOUP is urging the UK government to introduce a single plastic recycling certification scheme aimed at reducing the export of plastic waste and making more companies more inclined to use recycled packaging. Mr Morgan is optimistic that a UK government consultation this year will seriously consider what changes should be implemented to save the plastic recycling industry. Packaging reforms are indeed being implemented, alongside £10bn of investment in new plastic sorting and processing facilities, according to a spokesperson from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). They also say the Deposit Return Scheme, launching in October 2027, will create higher quality material for recycling, as consumers will be encouraged to return drinks bottles and cans to collection points to collect the small deposit they will have paid on purchase. The government has also convened a Circular Economy Taskforce. ""Our collection and packaging reforms will support UK-based recycling, meaning we can reduce our dependency on exports of plastic waste,"" says the spokesperson. ""The export of waste is subject to strict controls set out in UK legislation."" Over in Brussels, Virginia Janssens is the managing director at Plastics Europe, which represents plastic producers, including those with recycling operations and that use recycled materials. She's concerned that the plastic recycling industry is set to flourish outside Europe. ""Business will go where it makes sense and where it's cheapest to build. If those big production plans are built somewhere else, with huge investments of billions, they're not all of a sudden then going to decide to go back and build one in Europe,"" says Ms Janssens. ""It will have a huge effect on our value chain. It would set us back to 20 years ago, when we would have to incinerate or use landfill more, and that would be a real shame. Nobody wants this."" But there are some bright spots in an otherwise struggling industry. Biffa, for example, has recently acquired bottle manufacturer Esterform, which uses recycled PET. Meanwhile, Enviroo recently secured £58m to build a new recycling facility in the north-west of England, specialising in converting PET drink bottles into a recycled granulate that can be used in food packaging. Due to be operational by 2026, the plant is expected to process up to 35,000 tonnes of plastic annually. Mr Detta believes being a specialist in an industry of generalists, and going back to the fundamentals of plastic recycling, will be his key to success. ""I'm not here to tell you I've got the most innovative technology. No - I've looked at the real, hardcore problems and said, 'What is it that I need to resolve?"" Plastic Energy, meanwhile, is successfully converting plastic waste into pyrolysis oil that can be used to make food and medical grade plastic. Headquartered in London, the company has plants in Spain, France and the Netherlands. CEO Ian Temperton is preparing to benefit from an anticipated under supply of recycled plastic as recycled content targets kick in across Europe: by 2040, plastic drinks bottles must contain at least 65% recycled content. ""We're about developing and continuing to enhance the technology that deals with waste plastics. Having partners commit to new investments over the next couple of years is going to be a bit harder, but it's very clear the market will be very significantly under-supplied against any version of the targets,"" says Mr Temperton. ""So I will keep my team focused on the best technology for when that comes.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv8e0prg9o
2025-10-24,Minister apologises to farmers and says he'll fix Lough Neagh issues,science,BBC,"Northern Ireland's agriculture minister has apologised to farmers for decisions made by predecessors that incentivised agricultural growth but contributed to pollution in Lough Neagh. Andrew Muir said ""we got things wrong in the past and I apologise for that"" but vowed to ""fix the situation"". The UK's largest lake has been blighted by blooms of toxic blue-green algae at levels not seen since the 1970s, with fertiliser run-off from farming seen as one of the primary causes. When asked if farmers were owed an apology after being incentivised to accelerate agricultural production under published in 2012, Muir said it was something Stormont had to ""own up to"". aimed to significantly increase the agri-food industry's value and create jobs. The strategy, jointly sponsored by the then agriculture minister Michelle O'Neill and her economy counterpart Arlene Foster, incentivised an expansion of Northern Ireland's agricultural output, including the beef and dairy sector. However, the expansion has meant more slurry being spread on farms, the run-off of which often finds its way into waterways like Lough Neagh. Phosphorous, a mineral found in slurry and fertilisers, has been shown to be a leading cause of algal blooms. Northern Ireland's Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute has said that , with most phosphorous in waterbodies coming from agriculture. Farmers are now being asked to scale back their production through the Northern Ireland Nutrients Action Programme (NAP), which tightens fertiliser and manure limits and brings in tougher environmental rules to curb pollution. ""I would say, as minister of agriculture, environment and rural affairs, we got things wrong in the past, and I apologise for that,"" Muir told BBC Newsline. ""But what I want to do is to work with people. I want to fix the situation that we're seeing around this, and that's what I'm committed to doing."" Lough Neagh has been beset with pollution and environmental issues in recent years. High levels of blue-green algae appeared on the lough in 2023 and has become a recurring problem. It can cause minor health affects in people but poses a bigger risk to pets, livestock and wildlife. Long-term pollution - largely from agriculture - is a key part of the problem. Those who live by the lough and who use it for work and for pleasure have Muir said there were a ""number of science-led interventions"" under way to treat the algae issue. ""This is in relation to predicting, but also managing the blooms."" , including using space technology to detect where and when blooms may form, solar-powered booms to contain algal mats and even removing chunks of them for biomass fuel. Muir also said he is hopeful he can introduce legislation that will increase fines for polluters and act as a deterrent before the next election. ""I've been on record on my disappointment in terms of lack of support in recent months, but in recent weeks I've had a bit more hope in terms of my engagement with party leaders,"" he said. ""I'm a glass-half-full kind of person and there's an opportunity ahead over the next number of months to chart a better course for Lough Neagh, and I'm hopeful about that.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy16yx7x68o
2025-10-24,Anti-solar group fears voices will not be heard,science,BBC,"Campaigners are concerned local voices will not be heard over plans for a giant solar farm that could power 200,000 homes. Energy firm Aukera is behind the Tasway Energy Park near Long Stratton, in Norfolk, which would cover 3,600 acres and generate 700 megawatts. The Stop Tasway Solar campaign has raised concerns about the loss of farmland, ""industrialisation of the countryside"", and claimed local views would be ignored by central government, which would approve or reject the application instead of the  the local council in this case. Steve Milburn, from Aukerer, said: ""It's very important the community engage with the project and we want to hear from them."" Myles Jeeves, from the campaign group, said there was ""a huge amount of worry and sadness"" and fields would be replaced by ""a carpet of concrete and glass"". ""I think given the scale of it — we are not talking a couple of panels in a field, but a power station — the bigger concern is there isn't a viable route for criticism of this because it's going to go to Ed Miliband,"" he said. Due to the size of the project, the final approval would rest with Miliband's Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ). Earlier this month the department approved a similar-sized project in Lincolnshire, with the secretary of state concluding the benefits of the proposed development The decision marked the 17th nationally-significant ""clean"" energy project approved by the government since July 2024. Several major energy projects were already planned for south Norfolk, including the 2,700-acre which would run through the Long Stratton area between Norwich and Tilbury, in Essex. South Norfolk's Labour MP Ben Goldsborough another solar farm was ""unfair on residents"". A DESNZ spokesperson said: ""Solar is the cheapest power – getting us off fossil fuels and delivering energy security so we can get bills down for good. ""All projects are subject to rigorous planning processes, and the views of the local community must be taken into account."" virtually, with in-person events in Ashwellthorpe, Forncett St Mary, Bunwell and Tacolneston. Mr Milburn, the firm's senior project development manager, said the Tasway project was in its early days, but a planning application was due to be submitted in 2027. He said demand for electricity was at an ""all time high"" and was projected to double by 2050. ""We will endeavour to design a project which is sensitive to local community needs,"" he said. ""[Tasway would] make a significant contribution not only to the nation's energy security but also to the government's ambitious greenhouse gases net zero target.""

2025-10-24,Coastguard sinks two boats bought for £1 after rescue,science,BBC,"A £1 dream of a life on the ocean ended up underwater when two boats were sunk by authorities after drifting for days in shipping lanes. There is a growing issue with abandoned boats, which are left for councils and harbours to try to deal with - some offering these vessels for sale for small sums or for free. The maiden voyage of bargain hunters, who bought a 60 tonne boat for £1, ended when they , with coastguards taking the ""unusual"" decision to sink the vessels in a ""controlled operation"". Sold by Brixham Marina for £1, the Faithful, formerly a fishing boat and AirBnB, came into difficulty 30 miles (48.2km) into its journey on 7 October. What happened next would cause maritime authorities a headache that would last for several days - a large boat drifting in Devon's shipping lanes, without power or crew. In what sources said was a ""highly irregular"" decision, on 11 October, the coastguard authorised and tasked a salvage company to sink the vessel, which was carrying two tonnes of diesel. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said its decision was due to the ""unseaworthy condition of the former fishing vessel and self-declared inability of the owner to carry out recovery"". Fishing industry experts said they had not been informed of the wreck's exact location and warned it was potentially a ""massive maritime hazard"". Brixham fisherman Richard Fowler said trawlers nets, which run along the seabed,  could ""catch"" on the large wreck, possibly causing damage or the capsize and sinking of the fishing boat. ""[If] they lose the boat, there's a possibility of three, four, five lives being lost,"" he said. ""Why haven't we been informed?"" The MCA said the vessels ""were sunk at a depth not requiring a Notice to Mariners"" and it had shared the area where the boats had gone down but ""the exact position on the seabed is yet to be confirmed"". It said a navigation warning had been issued online and to the local harbour. While the BBC has been unable to trace the new owners, locals suggested the boats were bound for Ireland. At the time the Faithful left port it was pictured with the second smaller yacht tied to its side. The BBC tried to speak to the person who took the image but was unable to identify them. The coastguard said the location of the wreck was about 20 miles (32km) south-west of Salcombe, ""away from sensitive marine areas and sub-sea infrastructure"". Fishers said exact locations of hazards were normally communicated with the industry for safety reasons but even the approximate position was causing alarm. A navigation warning had been broadcast on a maritime safety website since the sinking, the MCA said. Beshlie Pool, executive officer of South Devon and Channel Shellfishermen, said it was ""extremely important that all information about obstacles and hazards at sea are communicated swiftly, accurately and widely to prevent risks to safety"". Trawler owner Michael Sharp said he had never known the coastguard to sink a boat. ""There's places it [Faithful] should have been towed to, to sink clear of fishing ground,"" he added. Chris Graham, from the Marine Conservation Society, said sinking a vessel carrying diesel would have been a ""last resort"", which would likely have an environmental impact despite it being a small amount compared with oil spills. ""It's only a matter of time - a ticking time bomb - before that fuel gets out of the vessel... you'll get that fuel into the water column, onto the seabed, onto the surface, where they'll be affecting birds and fish, and other life,"" he said. Describing the case as ""unusual"", he added: ""We want to really minimise and stop environmental impact from human activities such as this."" The coastguard said there ""was no significant pollution"" at the time and it used aircraft and counter pollution satellite surveillance to monitor for pollution. It said where necessary it would take action. It added it was ""vital"" boat owners took the conditions of their boats seriously, adding: ""Unseaworthy vessels drifting without power or crew into busy waters have the potential to pose a serious danger to life and other vessels."" Mr Fowler was still concerned about the coastguard's course of action: ""It's bad enough the fact that they've sunk it, they've had plenty of time to do other things."" The BBC understands the coastguard had been trying to find a port to take in the boats but were not met with enthusiasm due to the left to dispose of abandoned boats with no insurance. The Faithful had previously been used as a short-term holiday let and most recently a live-aboard boat, until the former owner died. As a result, Brixham Marina said it was left to deal with the boat with no money in the former owner's estate to pay the bills. The 58ft (17.5m) boat was possibly an attractive purchase on the surface, but the advert had warned of the need for ""substantial repairs"". There is a growing graveyard of abandoned boats blighting coastal communities and it is a problem that councils and harbours struggle to deal with. Tor Bay harbour master Nick Burns said ports like his continued to face ""significant challenges"" from abandoned vessels as ports are often left paying for responsible disposal. ""While the idea of acquiring an old or abandoned boat at a low price may seem appealing, buyers should be aware that such purchases often come with significant hidden liabilities,"" he said. For those who may romanticise about a boat-owning life, he strongly advised conducting ""thorough due diligence"". ""Ownership of a neglected vessel can quickly become a financial and legal burden, far outweighing the initial cost,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wvp5j4qqko
2025-10-24,New consultation launched over major solar scheme,science,BBC,"A fresh consultation has been launched into proposals for what, if approved, would be one of the UK's largest solar energy schemes. Energy developer Island Green Power wants to build the 500MW Light Valley Solar project, consisting of seven solar farms on a 2,520 acre (1,020 hectare) site, between York and Selby. Annette Lardeur, senior project development manager, said this third consultation concerned changes to the plans which were ""minor in nature"" and would ""improve safety and access"". However, Louise Billingham, from campaign group Rooftops Not Countryside, said its members remained opposed to the plans due to the site's ""vast scale and inappropriate placement"". Further land on the development would be used for underground cabling to connect the sites to the national grid at Monk Fryston substation, meanwhile a 500MW battery energy storage system (BESS) was also proposed. Due to the size of the proposed development, which would be located between the villages of Escrick, Monk Fryston, Hambleton, Chapel Haddlesey and South Milford, the Light Valley Solar scheme has been declared a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project. That means planning permission will be decided by the national Planning Inspectorate, rather than North Yorkshire Council. , Ms Lardeur said she wanted to ""encourage people to share their views"" as part of the new consultation. ""The changes we are consulting on are minor in nature and have been introduced to improve safety and access if the scheme is consented,"" she explained. ""As well as this, they aim to reduce the amount of construction traffic passing through villages. I encourage people to share their views."" Ms Billingham said the campaign group, which had collected nearly 3,000 signatures against the plans, said if the solar farm went ahead, ""our countryside will no longer be countryside, it will be a vast industrial estate"". ""This impromptu round of consultation is for Light Valley Solar to make changes that will remove established hedgerows, trees and nature and also build lay-bys and roads,"" she said. ""They plan to build one million 4m high solar panels, numerous substations and BESS sites, as well as cable corridors, high-security fencing and CCTV across 13 miles of countryside between Monk Fryston and Escrick."" The group had so far raised at least £2,000 through crowdfunding for the campaign against the plans, which would pay for banners and leaflets to raise awareness of the proposed solar farm, Ms Billingham added. If approved, Light Valley would be bigger than what is currently the largest operational solar scheme, at Cleave Hill in Kent. The scheme would provide enough power for 115,000 homes a year, according to Island Green Power.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyl1741xqlo
2025-10-23,South Korea's fishermen keep dying. Is climate change to blame?,science,BBC,"Hong Suk-hui was waiting on the shore of South Korea's Jeju Island when the call came. His fishing boat had capsized. Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned. ""When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,"" said Mr Hong. Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats had sunk or capsized. ""The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,"" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association. ""Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change."" Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents. This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training. The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C. Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense. They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living. Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to ""stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters"". On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations. ""I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,"" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. ""The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous."" A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half. Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan. ""Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,"" he said. ""If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out."" Professor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024. ""Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,"" he told the BBC. Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed. One foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled. As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes. ""In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,"" he said. ""But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish."" This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%. Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed. ""The haul is basically worthless,"" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages. ""The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,"" Park continued. ""I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading."" And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier. Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers. Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as ""a vicious and tragic cycle"". When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, ""you have a higher chance of meeting disaster"", she explained. On 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery. One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat. ""It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,"" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death. Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. ""Ultimately it is their call when to go out,"" she said. As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. ""Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,"" she said. Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. ""Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced."" The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels. The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates. Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire. Because the problem will likely worsen. forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories. ""The future looks very bleak,"" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last. ""Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward."" ""These days it's just really tough.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg924nrgd3o

2025-10-24,Barrier at beauty spot to deter dirty campers,science,BBC,"A barrier is to be installed at a Loch Leven car park this winter in an attempt to stop antisocial ""dirty"" campers using the site in the summer. It will be installed at the Burleigh Sands car park after Scotland's nature agency, NatureScot, said it had seen ""unprecedented"" levels of use. The beauty spot has previously been described as being ""like the wild west,"" with campers verbally abusing and threating staff, and leaving behind litter and human waste. NatureScot's planning application to install the barrier and gate at Burleigh Sands car park was unanimously approved by Perth and Kinross councillors at a meeting earlier this month. During the meeting, councillors heard claims that the majority of campers are going beyond the accepted definition of wild camping by arriving by vehicles, putting up large tents and camping for multiple nights. A report presented to the council by Savills on behalf of NatureScot told councillors that the amount of people staying overnight increased during 2024 with more than 800 motorhomes using the car park and many of them have no on-board toilet facilities. In order to tackle the problem, NatureScot proposed installing a bright yellow 2.1m high barrier and six-metre long hinged gate across the car park's entrance. A code will be given to the emergency services and other services that require it to open the barrier. Bailie Mike Williamson, a senior councillor, said there was an issue with how tourism was managed in Perth and Kinross more generally. ""I believe there needs to be a much wider conversation about some of the negative impacts of tourism,"" he said. ""My fear is we could lose our right to roam unless it's dealt with or managed more properly."" Kinross-shire ward councillor Dave Cuthbert said the woodland car park, which has space for 30 cars, was not the actual problem. He said he was concerned the barrier could impact on usage of the car park by people just coming to walk. A NatureScot spokesperson said Loch Leven is first and foremost a nature reserve. They said the emphasis was on protecting wildlife while welcoming responsible visitor access. ""Unfortunately, in recent years there have been unsustainable levels of campervan and car camping at the Burleigh Sands car park, with associated issues including toileting, litter, fires and damage to vegetation"" the spokesperson said. They said the high levels of people using the carpark had a negative impact on the reserve, its wildlife and visitors enjoyment, meaning locals less keen to go to the reserve during the busier summer months. NatureScot said the gate would be used to manage high numbers of visitors or antisocial behaviour. They added: ""There are currently no plans to open and close the gate at set times."" If the gate is closed people will still be able to access Loch Leven through other gateways and footpaths around the loch, NatureScot said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypgz4vz39o
2025-10-24,"Busway through orchard will ruin trees, says owner",science,BBC,"The owner of a historical orchard said its apple trees will not survive being dug up and moved to make way for a proposed busway. Coton Orchard lies in the path of the proposed £200m Cambourne to Cambridge (C2C) guided busway. Planners hoped that linking the town and city will ease congestion on local roads and 10,000 trips will be made each day on the new route. However, Anna Gazeley, whose family owns the Coton Orchard, told an ongoing public inquiry into the proposals that 12 of the oldest Bramley apple trees on the site were ""fragile"", vital to the area's ecosystem and would not survive the move. The C2C Busway project has been put together by the Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) on behalf of Cambridgeshire County Council. If it goes ahead it will see a new busway built from Cambourne to Cambridge, via the Bourn Airfield development, Hardwick, Coton, and the West Cambridge Site. A pathway alongside the busway is also proposed for pedestrians and cyclists. A travel hub is also planned at Scotland Farm. The proposed route would run through Coton Orchard, which is a century-old 60-acre site. Ms Gazeley told the inquiry on Wednesday that her father bought the orchard in 1996 after he had seen other orchards he knew from his childhood disappear. She told inspectors about the ecological importance of the orchard, and shared fears about the impact the development would have on its ""fragile"" trees. It was ""one of the largest remaining traditional orchards in Cambridgeshire"" and had been designated a priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and a county wildlife site, she said. ""This is a habitat with ecological memory - more than 100 botanical species have been recorded in its understory, such as mosses, liverworts, fungi... confirming as ecological evidence has shown that this site has matured far beyond commercial cultivation,"" she added. She said the trees were ""fragile"" and argued they would not survive the move. ""The applicant now accepts the veteran status of those founding Bramleys, yet still asserts that no loss or deterioration would result from the scheme,"" she said. One of the legal representatives of the Cambridgeshire County Council challenged Ms Gazeley on her evidence and questioned its credibility. They highlighted an example in her written submission of a reference she made to an article about the impact of moving trees, which they said did not actually exist. They said: ""You referred to a reference that does not exist. It has been made up and hallucinated by AI."" Ms Gazeley said she had used AI to help create her submission and accepted it may not be a perfect document. However, she said there were other references made and advice taken from experts about the impact of moving the trees. She said: ""Those trees, they are hollow, they are fragile, the features that make them veteran trees is what makes them structurally very poor. ""The thought that you can sever the roots, pull them up, drag them the length of the orchard to put them in a hole and expect them to survive with no deterioration defies credibility."" At the conclusion of the inquiry, which is taking place in Cambourne and expected to last until November, inspectors will make recommendations to the government about the scheme.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvnee3qw8o

2025-10-26,Hurricane Melissa strengthens as it barrels towards Jamaica,science,BBC,"Hurricane Melissa is forecast to become a rare category five storm as it turns towards Jamaica, bringing life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. The cyclone, which had winds of up to 120 mph (195 km/h) as of 06:00 GMT, is currently turning north-west in the Caribbean and is expected to make landfall by Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC). It warns of power cuts and damage to infrastructure as Melissa brings up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain and sea level surges as high as 13ft (4m) above ground. ""Seek shelter now,"" residents have been told. Melissa is the 13th hurricane in this year's Atlantic season, which typically ends in November. A category five hurricane is the strongest type, with winds of at least 157mph. While Melissa is set to weaken to a category four before reaching Jamaica, the NHC said there was ""very little practical difference in the overall impacts"" upon landfall, and that the hurricane will be ""at least that intensity"" when it hits the island. With tropical storm-strength winds and rain already expected well before it passes over central Jamaica - including potentially the capital, Kingston - it warns that ""preparations should be rushed to completion"". ""A multi-day period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall have begun and will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides,"" the meteorological agency urged residents. It also said the storm is moving slowly - at 5mph - which is causing more damage. ""This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,"" said NHC deputy director Jamie Rhome. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: ""I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so: you should be concerned. ""But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared."" Residents are being told to secure their homes with sandbags and wooden boards, and to stock up on essentials. Warnings are also in effect parts of Haiti including the capital, Port au Prince, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is anticipated to bring similar effects by the middle of next week. Landslides already being caused by the hurricane have already killed two in Haiti, the nation's Civil Protection agency has said. Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Antillas Mayores and out into the Atlantic. By the time it reaches Cuba, it is predicted to have weakened to a category three  storm. While it is hard to link individual weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making weather phenomena more common and more severe. Warmer oceans produce more moisture in the air, helping fuel the formation of hurricanes. Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity, citing warmer seas and potential stronger monsoon activity around West Africa - where Atlantic storms often form.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkqvxkzx0o

Gosforth Nature Reserve, on the outskirts of Newcastle, is one of the oldest reserves in the region and is home to marshland, wetlands and reed beds. Every year volunteers are needed to cut back reeds, clear organic build-up and plant seeds for the coming spring. Paul Drummond, reserve warden for more than 30 years, said help was needed to ""wind back the clock"" at rare habitats and that volunteers needed to be prepared to ""get muddy"". He said: ""We have a range of special habitats and we need to get them ready for next year. ""Maintenance work is important to keep them stable and not allow nature to transform them."" The reserve is owned by the Arena Racing Company, which also owns Newcastle Racecourse, and it has been leased to the history society for the last 101 years. Mr Drummond said habitats like the wetlands are vital for rare birds like bitterns and more common ones like reed warblers. Work needs to be done to clear reeds and make sure trees do not grow and transform the area into woodland. The reserve warden said anyone considering volunteering needed to bring wellies or boots. ""Coming and helping with the maintenance work is good for people and it is good for the environment,"" he said.

His company, Matter, could win £1m at the Earthshot awards on 5 November, whose winners are commended for innovative solutions they create to help the planet. Microplastics have been found on every part of Earth, including and inside the guts of animals living in the deepest ocean trenches. Concerns have persisted over their potential risk to Mr Root told BBC Essex's Sonia Watson that microplastics had become one of the ""biggest pollution sources on the planet"". ""I was looking at how we solve that and started developing solutions,"" said the inventor, who built the prototype after leaving his engineering job eight years ago. He said creating Regen - his self-cleaning, reusable product - was ""challenging"" and was the result of four years of work in a laboratory. ""I was also working off my mother-in-law's dining table for about nine months,"" recalled Mr Root, whose head office is now in Bristol. ""I then upgraded to working out of a stable for a little while in the rural parts of Essex, and eventually made it 'big time' and got a unit on a turkey farm."" Mr Root was supported by a £250 grant from The Prince's Trust, now The King's Trust, to begin building his invention. He also had the support of his wife, who gave up her job and helped. The business started off building filters for household washing machines, but has since raised more than £15m for its work and employs about 45 people.

""Now, we can work with ecologists to protect the dormice at this site and encourage this population's recovery."" The tiny nocturnal species has already disappeared from 20 counties in England since the 19th Century. The loss of traditional skills such as coppicing has led to their habitats being lost, which also makes it more difficult for populations to travel between locations.

National Infrastructure Commission chairman Mr Clubb believes the initial focus should be Wales' ""oldest housing stock in western Europe"" which he believes leaves many in fuel poverty. ""For Wales, probably the first thing we should be doing is looking at a programme of insulation, and UK government should be putting money into that,"" Mr Clubb said. Ministers have talked about a £20 billion investment in carbon capture and storage, which he said is ""likely not going to make a big impact on our ambitions for net zero by 2050"". Mr Clubb, a green energy technology expert, said it was far better to invest first in making homes warmer and easier to heat ""than to be spending huge sums of money, which will create jobs, yes, but in a very localised area"". One of the areas to benefit from clean energy investments is Pembrokeshire College, in Haverfordwest. Its hoping to start training 200 new students in the coming months in trades from plumbing to engineering. It is part of a pilot scheme to develop skilled workers needed in the transition to clean energy that ministers say will bring 15,000 new jobs to Wales. Seventeen-year-old Theo, from Monkton said he believes there will be a ""lot of money"" in the new green jobs. ""[There is] a lot of opportunity so I thought I might as well pursue it, and I've enjoyed it ever since,"" he said. Welding student Bethany, also 17, from Haverfordwest, is hoping to end up in a clean energy job. ""It's amazing how far they've come with everything,"" she said. ""I'm just excited to be part of that new whole thing going on."" Mr Clubb welcomes the jobs, but questioned whether large scale green projects will benefit Wales. ""For me, and the Infrastructure Commission... we're disappointed that ownership of these projects is not being considered,"" he said. Most projects are owned outside of the country, he said, with only a few developed by the the community energy sector and small companies in Wales. ""We would like to see a renewable energy bill that gave the opportunity for local organisations and people to buy into projects,"" he said. Sam Kurtz, the Conservatives' economy and energy spokesperson and Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MS, also welcomed the new investment but raised concerns about the implications for oil and gas. ""We need to look at this in the wider context of where energy bills have got to after Labour have come to power, and that promise of cutting £300 off energy bills,"" he said. ""Energy bills are now nearly £200 more expensive in the 12 months since the General Election, so the promise of jobs is welcome, but the alienation of our traditional oil and gas industries as well, is driving up the cost of people's bills."" The Welsh government welcomed the clean energy jobs, saying they are ""central"" to the its vision for Wales . A spokesperson said: ""The impact of high energy prices in recent years shows that it is essential for us to improve our energy security and reduce our dependence on imported energy. ""With our abundance of natural resources, Wales is in an ideal position to accelerate our renewable energy contribution and at the same time address climate change challenges. ""We are committed to ensuring carbon capture and storage is deployed to support industry to decarbonise.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q1057vy7lo
2025-10-25,Bird flu prevention zone measures introduced to prevent disease's spread,science,BBC,"Bird flu measures that require flock owners to adhere to strict biosecurity rules to prevent the disease's spread will come into effect on Saturday 1 November. Known as Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) measures, the rules allow poultry and captive birds to go outdoors but steps must be taken to ensure no wild birds can access their food or water. Mandatory rules on cleaning and disinfection must also be followed. Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir said the measures were ""vital tools"" in the fight against disease. He added that similar requirements have been introduced in the Republic of Ireland at the same time. He said the onset of winter migration meant the risk of bird flu being introduced via wild birds is ""heightened"", adding that the disease ""can cause devastating impacts for those affected and our wider industry"". Muir has asked all bird keepers to take the appropriate action to protect their birds, the Northern Ireland flock and wider agri-food industry. Chief veterinary officer Brian Dooher added that ""stringent, mandatory biosecurity measures"" help prevent the spread of the disease from wild birds. ""There is currently no requirement for poultry to be housed, and bird gatherings are not prohibited at this stage, but this will be kept under constant review,"" Mr Dooher said. ""I would encourage all flock keepers, even if you keep just one bird, to review and reinforce your biosecurity in order to prevent an incursion of the disease into our poultry flock. ""Avian influenza can have a significant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy, it is imperative that we do not become complacent.""

2025-10-26,Joseph Banks: the man who collected the world,science,BBC,"Born in 1743, Banks grew up on his father's estate, Revesby Abbey, near Horncastle, where he became fascinated with nature, as the ""He would have seen all of the Lincolnshire Fens before they were drained and there would be ponds and lakes and lagoons and birds. It was described as the aviary of England,"" says Paul Scott, who works at the Sir Joseph Banks Society in Horncastle. Banks developed his interest in botany while studying at Eton. ""He noticed old ladies picking plants,"" Paul adds. ""They told him that they were collecting [them] for apothecaries and quacks for medicines."" ""He was paying the old ladies a few pennies a time to tell him what the plants were and what they were used for."" Banks deepened his love for exploration by embarking on a voyage across the Atlantic to Newfoundland and Labrador, in northern Canada, in 1766. According to Paul, Banks ""was interested in everything"" he found in these lands –  the way that the indigenous peoples lived, the clothes they wore, the food they ate and the tools they used."" Sir David Attenborough, the patron of the society, has spoken of how Banks methodically collected ordinary items, such as a fishhook, made by people who had no knowledge of European technology. But while Banks was passionate about exploration, the sea was not his friend. ""He was really seasick for most of the time on that voyage which must have been fairly miserable,"" Paul says. Despite this, in 1768, Banks joined Cook's voyage to the South Pacific on HMB Endeavour. Paul says it was ""the first purposeful scientific mission"" launched from the UK. ""Going around the world was pretty common, still very dangerous, but nobody had ever equipped a vessel with scientific equipment and scientists to go and do science."" The aim of the mission was to witness the transit of Venus in Tahiti. It would last three years and Endeavour, a former cargo ship less than 100ft (30 metres) long, was home to 98 people. When they reached Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the governor barred them from landing. ""But this didn't stop Banks, says Paul. ""He sent his servants at night out in a rowing boat to collect plants up the river... under the governor's nose."" From there they went further south, round Cape Horn, at the tip of South America, before reaching Tahiti. ""There were some relationships between some of the crew and some of the Tahitian women,"" Paul says. ""Banks also took part in that. He had a relationship with the princess or the queen of Tahiti. ""Rather famously, one evening he spent with her, he fell asleep and she stole his trousers. So, he had to go back onto Endeavour with no trousers, which must have been hilarious for the crew."" The Endeavour moved on to New Zealand and Australia, where the crew found plants and animals, such as kangaroos, that no Europeans had seen before. However, it was not an easy journey. ""Half the crew died in this voyage,"" says Paul. ""This was not a Thomas Cook cruise, it was a James Cook expedition."" Nine Maori people were killed during their first encounter with Cook in what is now the city of Gisborne, New Zealand, an incident that continues to cause controversy and led to a "" "" by the UK government in 2019. And the traditional celebration of Cook as the ""discoverer"" of Australia has become increasingly controversial because Aboriginal people lived on the land for tens of thousands of years before he arrived. In 2023, it was announced that spears belonging to Aboriginal people and taken by Cook's crew when they first arrived in Botany Bay, Australia, would be given back. They were taken after a violent encounter with members of the Gweagal clan. Meanwhile, the role of indigenous peoples, including Polynesian and Maori societies, in helping Banks identify and describe hundreds of species of plants has recently been highlighted in However, back in 1771, when the Endeavour's crew returned to Britain, Paul says ""people couldn't believe what they'd found and seen"". ""They became very well known in society. ""Everybody in London wanted to invite them for dinner, including the king. They were celebrities."" Later, King George III tasked Banks with creating the finest botanic gardens in the world, at Kew. He also served as president of the Royal Society for more than 40 years, until his death in 1820 aged 77. He was, says Paul, a man of huge wealth and influence. ""This was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Everything of any significance went across his desk. ""Our empire was expanding, the map was changing and Britain's importance in the world was expanding, and Banks was at the centre of all of that."" Today, Banks is honoured around the world in place names such as the Banks Islands, in Vanuatu, and the flowering plants known as Banksia. But in recent years, conversations have opened up about more controversial, colonial legacies. He was instrumental in recommending the establishment of the penal colony in Botany Bay, stating that there would be there would be ""little probability of any opposition from the natives"". This would turn out to be incorrect, The Aboriginal warrior Pemulwuy led resistance against the Sydney colonists, but was shot dead in 1802. His severed head was . In 2010, during a visit to Australia by Prince William, there were , though their whereabouts are at present unknown. Beyond his imperial legacy, Banks also had a big impact in his home county of Lincolnshire. ""We just need to look at our canal system – the Horncastle to Tattershall canal, the Sleaford canal, the Grantham canal,"" Paul explains. The Horncastle canal opened in 1802 and over the next 20 years, the town ""became prosperous and connected to the rest of the country"". Banks was also behind the drainage of the Fens. ""All that land now is perhaps some of the finest growing land in the country and it was Banks that was instrumental in having those fens drained.""

2025-10-28,'Bogus' snail farms set up to avoid business rates,science,BBC,"Boxes of snails have been found in central London offices by council officers investigating tax avoidance schemes. Crates of gastropods have been discovered in the past in what Westminster City Council described as ""unscrupulous traders"" trying to claim agricultural business tax exemptions by saying they were running snail farms. Council leader Adam Hug says the recent discovery, at two buildings in Old Marylebone Road, ""vividly illustrates an issue of business rates avoidance based on a ludicrous notion"". from paying business rates if they are . The government has been asked for comment. To date, the council says it has lost about £370,000 due to this avoidance scheme, which it says building landlords are also ""complicit"" in. Four such ""snail farms"" have been liquidated by Westminster City Council for non-payment of business rates and the authority said it was trying to wind up a further two through a legal process. The council said it had also asked the Insolvency Service to consider banning the  directors of these companies from any other future directorships. But Hug said a new law was needed to give councils the power to shut down avoidance scams quickly, rather than by going to court. ""Rather than unscrupulous traders dropping on one avoidance scheme after another, it would be good to see a general clause on business rate avoidance and evasion which stops these kinds of activities in their tracks,"" said Hug. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, which sets tax policy, has been approached for comment. Although local authorities are responsible for collecting business rates, The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is responsible for deciding whether a property is exempt. It also carries out checks to assess if properties are being used for legitimate agricultural purposes. As such, Westminster Council said it was unlikely the VOA would consider these premises to be exempt.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9v1rjlekpeo

Libraries Unlimited, the charity that runs the Devon County Council and Torbay's libraries, described the scheme as ""cost-effective"" as it was designed to prevent the public from purchasing costumes that would only be worn once. Katheryn and her daughter Sophie visited Pinhoe Library, Exeter, on the hunt for a Halloween costume. Sophie chose a Rapunzel costume for this year, and Katheryn said the scheme was ""really useful"" as her daughter could pick what she wanted to dress up as. Katheryn said her daughter had started asking for a new costume, but felt they were ""quite expensive in the shops"", so the initiative was a really good idea. She said: ""We do try and pass them down to friends and get some passed down to us as well, but it is really useful to just come here and have a pick of what they want to dress up as."" Katheryn also said the initiative had helped her on other occasions too, as it was offered for events such as World Book Day, and she could come in and borrow costumes when needed. Zoe Woodbridge, supervisor of Libraries Unlimited, said about 40% of Halloween costumes sold every year only get used once and the scheme was also ""a bit of an environmental initiative"" to reduce plastic waste.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6gwynwg6o

2025-10-28,Most countries fail to submit new climate pledges ahead of summit,science,BBC,"Only 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon, the UN says, despite all being required to do so ahead of next month's COP30 summit. Added together these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C, a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change. While the UN review does show progress in curbing carbon emissions over the next decade, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target. The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering. Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny. Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade. But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions. In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035. However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C. To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, ""This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement. ""It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation."" The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said. for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates. ""One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,"" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week. ""Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come."" Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope. Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil. Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035. Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts. ""It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,"" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change. ""They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot."" The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century. They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming ""greenhouse"" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere. One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden. While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

The presenter filmed with Bournemouth University researchers and students at an archaeological dig near Winterborne Kingston in Dorset where an Iron Age settlement and cemetery was excavated. During the episode of the Channel 4 show, called Hidden Wonders, researchers discovered the skeleton of a teenage girl buried face down in a pit, believed to have been murdered as a human sacrifice. Throughout the series, Toksvig, who has a degree in archaeology and anthropology from the University of Cambridge, explores four sites to unearth the secrets of Britain's past. Dr Miles Russell, the university's principal academic in prehistoric and Roman archaeology, worked with the former Great British Bake Off host during filming. He said: ""The team were particularly shocked to hear that this could have been a human sacrifice, but it was obvious from Sandi's own interest in archaeology that she was deeply moved by what had been uncovered."" ""Sandi was also very interested in the artefacts discovered by students in the pits and with the deceased, such as bronze brooches, a bronze bangle and a bone comb. ""The finds were often in a Roman style, demonstrating a blend between Roman and traditional Iron Age customs, helping us to build up a picture of the how these people lived and died 2,000 years ago."" Researchers have been examining DNA and isotopes recorded for the burials at the site where Their analysis suggests that the tribal lineage can be traced back to a single woman and that the communities were centred around the mothers of families, with men invited to live with women rather than the other way round. Dr Russell said it marked the first time researches had found evidence that some ancient western European societies were led by women and passed belongings down through the mother's side of the family.

Simon Johnson, 33, who lives in Harbour View in Kingston with his wife and two sisters, said the family had experienced hurricanes before - ""but not one of this size"". Living just 200m (650ft) from the harbour, he told the BBC he was ""feeling anxious"". They have stockpiled a week's worth of food, he added, but many of the supermarkets were empty and he could not find any bread in the neighbourhood. Officials warned people as the storm arrived to cover themselves with a mattress, move to an indoor room, and to wear a helmet if possible. Jamaican health officials also warned that flooding may displace crocodiles from their natural dwellings. Melissa is the strongest storm on record for the island nation - and the strongest globally this year. The NHC warned of ""catastrophic and life-threatening"" conditions once it landed in Jamaica, with torrential rainfall, deadly flash flooding and landslides. Three storm-related deaths were recorded on the Caribbean island, another three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic. Tourists in Jamaica described being ""stuck in limbo"" with the country's two international airports closed, flights cancelled and limited information from airlines. Rebecca Chapman, who travelled to Jamaica for her 25th wedding anniversary, said she had arrived on Thursday evening just as storm preparations began. She was staying in Lucea with her husband and their three teenage sons. ""The birds have all gone so it's all gone really quiet. It's like a ghost town,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme before the storm hit on Tuesday. The Foreign Office has advised Britons in Jamaica to follow local authority advice, ""especially in the event of any evacuation orders"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drjx9r0l8o
2025-10-28,"Jack 'undermined' recycling scheme, Slater says",science,BBC,"Scotland's deposit return recycling scheme was ""single-handedly undermined"" by former Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, ex-minister Lorna Slater has claimed. The plans collapsed in 2023 after a row between the Scottish and UK governments over internal market rules, leading waste firm Biffa to sue Holyrood ministers for more than £50m. Slater, giving evidence at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, accused Lord Jack of vetoing the scheme for political purposes. Lord Jack told the court last week that the Scottish government had been ""utterly irresponsible"" in encouraging firms to invest in the initiative. Slater, a Green MSP who stepped down as a minister last year following the collapse of her party's power-sharing deal with the SNP, said she had expected the UK government to ""act in good faith and work collaboratively"" to grant the scheme an exemption under the Internal Market Act. Downing Street refused to do so unless the Scottish government conformed to a UK-wide approach excluding glass, leading to the collapse of the Holyrood scheme. Slater told the court: ""I believe Alister Jack saw a political opportunity to give the SNP a black eye and to undermine my credibility, because he had this effective power of veto."" Roddy Dunlop KC, representing Biffa, questioned Slater over her claim that the UK government had acted in ""bad faith"". He raised issues over the inclusion of glass in the Scottish scheme and the 20p deposit rate that would have been applied to recyclable items - key sticking points in the discussions about granting an internal market exemption. Slater told the court that UK ministers could have signalled much earlier that they would not tolerate a divergence on glass, but instead had done so ""at the 11th hour"". She said UK ministers were also ""setting a condition that couldn't possibly be met"" by calling for alignment on the rate of the deposit - because that detail had not yet been agreed for a scheme south of the border. Mr Dunlop put it to the former minister that it reflected very poorly on the Scottish government to allow Biffa to ""sale into a situation"" where tens of millions of pounds were at stake without at least mentioning the internal market risks. Slater said there was ""no actual reason"" to use the Internal Market Act to block the scheme, unless it was for political purposes. The former minister added that she did not anticipate the risk of legislation being used in that way. The Scottish government has always insisted it was not to blame for the collapse of the plans and that it followed the proper processes around internal market rules. Lord Jack, now a peer in the House of Lords, told the court that the scheme was not ""viable"" unless it had an exemption from internal market rules. He said the Scottish government did not submit a detailed application until 2023, in the months before the scheme was due to go live. Lord Jack told the court the application should have been made a year earlier when he said it was clear an exemption was needed. ""Divergence was very clear from a very early stage,"" he said. ""My responsibility was to protect free trade, consumers and business who were very concerned about this in relation to the economy."" Scotland is not expected to have a deposit return scheme until October 2027 at the earliest, when Holyrood ministers are expected to align their plans with a UK government initiative.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd67n4l9zezo

2025-10-29,Hedgehog rescue urging caution around bonfires,science,BBC,"A hedgehog rescue centre preparing for an influx of cases urged caution ahead of bonfire night. Rachel Matthews and her husband Dominic set up Deanshanger Hedgehog Rescue on the border of Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire in 2021 and look after about 250 of the creatures each year. Mrs Matthews warned residents not to build bonfires too early, as a stack of logs, leaves, and other garden waste could appear inviting to a hedgehog looking to hibernate. ""Build it on the day and ideally, light it from one side so that if anything is in there, it has the chance to escape,"" she said. October to November is the centre's second busiest period, and it often deals with a large number of dehydrated hedgehogs, which it can treat ""quickly and effectively"". The influx of cases is not just down to bonfire night but due to the second hoglet season, which means hedgehogs are giving birth late in the season, whilst there's a scarce amount of food around. Hedgehogs eat insects like beetles and caterpillars, which tend to be harder to find as the temperature drops. Mrs Matthews said it was vital that people understood when a hedgehog needed to be rescued. ""No matter how well a hedgehog looks, if they are out in the day, there is something wrong with it, and you need to give us a call,"" she said. Hedgehogs have been classified as vulnerable to extinction since 2020. Fay Vass, CEO of The British Hedgehog Preservation Society, said one of the biggest reasons hedgehogs have declined 75% since 2000 is due to loss of habitat. ""All of us should be concerned that a pretty simple to please creature like the hedgehog is not managing to find what it needs to survive,"" she added. The couple are currently trying to raise £50k to open a ""hogspital"" with more space to treat the creatures. In the summer months - their busiest time - they have had to turn away hedgehogs in need due to capacity. Mr Matthews said the aim is to be the biggest regional rescue centre for hedgehogs and other wildlife, and not have to turn anyone away. Mrs Matthews added: ""When you have really poorly hedgehogs come in and then they get to the point of being released... that's what drives you.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4ldrw4y1o

The documentarian made a video plea on behalf of The Wildlife Trusts and Northumberland Wildlife Trust (NWT) appeal for £30m to buy the Rothbury Estate from the Duke of Northumberland's youngest son, Lord Max Percy. on Wednesday, inspiring thousands of people to donate to the trusts and their aim to boost wildlife and promote nature-friendly farming on the land. NWT's chief executive Mike Pratt said the broadcaster had put his ""time and priority"" into the fund, which has now topped £9m. Mr Pratt said people were not used to spending large sums of money to restore the environment, but added: ""If we want nature to thrive into the future, we really need to invest at that sort of scale and this is such a unique opportunity,. ""People can see that. David Attenborough has articulated that in his 100th year."" The Rothbury Estate stretches across more than 3,800 hectares (14.7 sq miles) and is roughly the size of the Greek capital Athens. It is the largest area of land to be put on sale in England in decades and sits in the heart of what nature experts said could be a 40-mile (64km) ""wild"" corridor, from the coast to Kielder and the Scottish border. Home to red squirrels, skylarks, curlews and salmon, it is a popular destination for walkers and cyclists. The charity has already purchased one parcel of the land, the Simonside Hills, and has a year to raise the £30m needed to secure the entire estate, or risk it being broken up and sold off. The Wildlife Trusts said Rothbury had ""clearly touched the hearts"" of the public. It received 8,624 donations in the 24 hours after Sir David's call to action. Individual gifts ranged from £1 to £10,000 and included some from mainland Europe and Australia. ""We're immensely grateful to each and every person who has donated and to the many who have shared their reflections about this wonderful landscape,"" the organisation said. ""Our deep gratitude goes to Sir David Attenborough, for supporting our appeal."" In his appeal, Sir David said: ""With the communities who live and work at Rothbury, The Wildlife Trusts will create a place where people and nature can thrive side-by-side.

Tommy, from Bury in Greater Manchester, has been given the title by waste management and recycling firm Biffa for helping his mum and dad drastically cut down their household waste. The 13-year-old said he likes ""seeing the bins getting filled up and also knowing that we don't waste anything"" after encouraging his family to switch from disposable to reusable everyday items. His mum Gemma said: ""We've saved thousands since we started recycling six years ago, it all adds up."" Tommy encouraged his parents to move to reusable everyday items including cloths, food bags and wet wipes. Artist Gemma, 42, and her husband Chris, 44, now have three waste bins in every room for paper, non-recyclables, bottles and cans, while in the kitchen, they have an extra one for flexible plastics. Gemma said she had been amazed by how much money the family had saved by making some simple swaps. She said: ""I've stopped using kitchen roll and replaced it with reusable kitchen roll that you wash. I've swapped a disposable mop for washable mop pads. ""Instead of cling film I use stretchy covers and kitchen foil has gone and instead I use washable silicone sheets."" The family also use reusable food bags and washable make-up remover pads. ""We also use biodegradable toothbrushes, tooth flossers, earbuds and have a bio bin upstairs,"" Gemma said. As a result of their recycling efforts, she said their general waste bin can last up to 12 weeks before it needs to be emptied. For anything that cannot be recycled from home, the family take it elsewhere. This includes flexible plastic and batteries to supermarket recycling facilities, and old clothes, electronics,  and old pens are taken to high street shops which run recycling schemes. ""Only dog poo and the occasional wet wipes go in the general waste bin, in biodegradable bags,"" she said. Tommy added: ""It's fun to be able to recycle. I like seeing the bins getting filled up and also knowing that we don't waste anything."" Georgia Gibson, Biffa's Social Value Manager in Manchester, said it was ""wonderful to see Tommy and his family inspiring people to waste less and recycle more"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874e2ggj3po
2025-10-30,Brits told to expect 'gappy' Christmas trees,science,BBC,"Britons are being told to expect ""gappy"" and shorter Christmas trees this year – thanks to volatile weather. One Lincolnshire grower explained that dry conditions – which triggered domestic hosepipe bans in parts of the UK – had stunted growth, leaving gaps between branches on trees, including spruces and Nordmann firs. While he made clear ""bushy trees"" would still be available, he planned to ""educate"" his customers about the volatility of the climate and the impact on the appearance of trees. Oliver Combe, from the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA), confirmed dry weather after an ""exceptionally wet"" 2024 had resulted in reduced growth. Mr Combe, the group's vice-chairman, has been growing trees in North Yorkshire since 1998. He said: ""Last year was really wet – the worst I can remember. That created a lot of problems with nutrient uptake and damage to roots because the trees were sitting in continuously waterlogged soil. ""This year it has been exceptionally dry, certainly in the east of the country. We had no appreciable rain from Easter until the middle of July – the time when trees put their maximum growth on. There was no rain to wash the nutrients in, so that's why we are getting restricted growth."" Staff at Fillingham Christmas Trees in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, said ""more gappy"" trees were the result. Owner William Rose added: ""Christmas trees don't like inconsistency. They might not have as many branches this year but we can't control that. That's nature."" Mr Rose said there would still be ""bushy trees"" available, pointing out that all trees – whether filled out or not – ""still look great"". Explaining why, in his opinion, real trees trumped artificial ones, he said: ""It's the joy of coming out to a farm and choosing your tree and, of course, the smell. You don't get that with an artificial tree."" Mr Rose added staff were ""educating"" customers about the challenges posed by unpredictable weather – a move applauded by the BCTGA. Joe Hoyes, owner of Town Gate Farm near Grimsby, agreed that 2025 had been challenging. He said: ""Christmas trees aren't irrigated, so they really do rely on the weather. The lack of rainfall has led to a shortening in growth. ""The top bit of trees, where people put the star, is shorter due to the dry weather preventing growth. There are also fewer 6ft and 7ft trees, also a result of the weather."" Neil Wright, owner of Newsholme Christmas Trees, near Goole, East Yorkshire, said: ""This spring, our transplanted trees took a battering because of the lack of rainfall."" He said he was planning to delay planting saplings – a practice already adopted by many Christmas tree growers – to increase the chances of plentiful rainfall. ""We are endeavouring to move transplanting to the autumn, so the trees have  winter – and the rainfall – to settle,"" he said. But the approach comes with risks, with Mr Wright explaining that trees could die if they have not properly ""shut down"" for winter. ""It's a very tight window,"" he added.

2025-10-30,'Jamaica will rise up together after hurricane',science,BBC,"Stafford Geohagen, a Brixton restaurateur, is one of many Londoners with family in Jamaica waiting for updates from their loved ones in the wake of Hurricane Melissa. The strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history, - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people. Jamaican authorities reported that at least five people had died in the St Elizabeth area on the southwest coast. Mr Geohagen said: ""When the dust has settled and we evaluate the damages, as a nation we shall come together and we shall rise up again."" In Jamaica, much of the country is isolated without power or phone coverage, and information is slowly trickling through. Three-quarters of the country had no electricity overnight, and many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds. Prime Minister Andrew Holness said Hurricane Melissa has caused ""total devastation"" in parts of the island, with the town of Black River completely destroyed. In nearby Haiti, at least 20 people - including 10 children - have died in river flooding caused by the hurricane, and a further 10 people are missing, the country's civil defence agency said. Haiti, significantly less developed than its neighbours, is likely to see ""extensive damage and isolation of communities"". Mr Geohagen, owner of Jamaican food outlet Healthy Eaters, said his parents, siblings and extended family all lived in Jamaica. ""We have to be very strong and maintain togetherness when these things happen. The rebuilding is always quite difficult. ""But one thing I can assure you - Jamaicans are strong, they are resilient, and they are always ready to weather the storm and take on whatever challenges that might present."" He said he urged his father to go and stay with his brother before the storm hit, and warned him that it would be a ""suicide mission"" if he stayed put. ""They went to stay with my elder brother,"" Mr Geohagen said. ""He's got more of a slab roof and he boarded up all his yard storm shutters. So that was the perfect place for them to go during this serious storm."" He said he had been trying to check in every hour with his family. ""I know there's a lot of power outages. ""My brother uses a different type of system that is more stable in terms of internet. ""Other family members I have been unable to get to. Most other people rely on the other providers in the island, and without power, most of these connection is gone. ""It's quite frustrating now, not knowing what is happening with the other members of the family."" He said the hurricane had brought the nation together, adding: ""Despite all the challenges that they might face otherwise, I'm quite certain Jamaica will build itself up. ""When the dust has settled and we evaluate the damages, together as a nation we shall come together and we shall rise up again together."" BBC London spoke to other Londoners who had family impacted by the hurricane. Jenna Gilbert said her relatives had to move to higher land after their house was flooded. ""Because they're right down by the sea, they have had to relocate. ""We have been getting barrels ready to send and they are in our prayers every day."" Another woman said she was ""very worried"", adding: ""I can't help. That makes me worried even more."" Brent resident Mandy Tomlin was on holiday in Ochi on the northern coast of Jamaica when the hurricane hit. She said people were ""fighting for survival"" and taking food from the hotel's restaurant when it went into lockdown. Ms Tomlin described hearing ""trees snapping and the wind rattling the doors"" as the hurricane arrived. ""It was terrifying, because obviously we have never been in a situation like this before so we didn't know what to do,"" she said. ""A lot of people were hiding in bathrooms."" The Jamaican government has ordered evacuations from high-risk areas, and all of the country's airports are shut. As many as 8,000 British nationals are in Jamaica, and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has urged them to register their presence through the government website to receive updates.

2025-10-30,Who are the workers who will fire Scotland's space industry?,science,BBC,"Millie Brown says she had never considered a career in the space industry. The fourth-year mechanical engineering student at the University of Strathclyde didn't think it was an option. But now she says the people and companies she has met during her course have opened her eyes to opportunities - and to Scotland's potential as a space leader. There are about 8,000 people working in jobs in Scotland related to the space sector. But over the next 10 years, as Scotland becomes a regular location for launches, there is an ambition to push that to 20,000. ""The Scottish space sector is growing at a really quick rate, so the skills I've learned here are going to be really helpful going forward,"" says Millie. The first launches of satellites into orbit are expected from in 2026. When operational, the spaceport is expected to launch up to 30 rockets per year. So with that, and other projects around Scotland, staff are required in large numbers. ""There's a vast gap in some major roles,"" explains Derek Harris, business operations manager at rocket manufacturer, Skyrora. A lot of them are specialist positions, like embedded engineers and system engineers, he explains, but they also need more traditional manufacturing workers, such as welders. ""All of these things are in demand by these (Scottish space companies) looking to grow. ""At present we have about 85 staff here in the facility in Cumbernauld. Once we scale up to do our launches on a commercial scale, that means we'll need somewhere between 250 and 300 staff here,"" Derek adds. Other space companies have seen and are expecting similar growth. This includes satellite producer AAC Clyde Space - which formed out of a merger between Clyde Space and the Swedish company AAC Microtec in 2019. Chief technical officer Andrew Strain points out that Clyde Space started making satellites 20 years ago with just two staff members. ""The company now for us is around 200 people across eight locations around the world,"" he adds. So where has this growth in staff come from? ""We have people coming from local colleges and universities, we have apprentices. We have people that have worked in parallel industries like assembly and manufacturing that we've picked up who have never worked in space before,"" Andrew says. Of the roughly 230 space companies and organisations operational in Scotland, they are often competing with sectors like renewables, oil and gas, defence, or manufacturing to secure workers. ""It's an ever-evolving thing, it's growing,"" says Ingmar Kamalagharan, the UK Space Agency's head of education and future workforce. About 55,000 people work in the space sector across the UK. He says: ""The sector has grown massively over the past 10 years. If we project forwards 10 years, we'll probably need the same number of people again."" Some of those people are being trained and hope to be employed directly from university. ""I've been always passionate about space, I remember my seventh birthday cake was a space shuttle,"" explains Farboud Foroughi, an engineering student at the University of Strathclyde. Both he and classmate Anushka Bansode have ambitions to go directly into the Scottish space industry. ""I would like to become either a navigation and control engineer for satellites or a systems engineer for typical space systems,"" says Farboud. Anushka added: ""When I was a kid, I was always interested in planets and the solar system and the galaxy and how it all works. And then later on, I got interested in engineering. ""I realised that I can combine these two and become a mechanical engineer who works in space."" A senior engineering lecturer at their university says Scotland is an exciting place for future workers. ""Scotland 15 years ago didn't do any launch - 25 years ago, we didn't make any satellites,"" says Dr Christie Maddock. ""Now we do launch systems, there are two or three space ports. We do almost all the aspects of it. ""Space science, astronomy, radio telescopes. So the space sector is and will continue to be massive and growing."" For Millie, a job in space is ""definitely on the cards"" but she says after a possible semester abroad, she may look at something overseas. And the challenge for Scottish companies is to retain people in a competitive market.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3epzvp3nxzo
2025-10-29,UK to provide £2.5m in support to Jamaica after hurricane,science,BBC,"The UK will provide £2.5m in emergency humanitarian funding to Jamaica, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has announced. UK relief supplies and technical experts have also been deployed to assist with the disaster response and recovery from the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons: ""The scenes of destruction emerging from Jamaica are truly shocking."" The £2.5m funding will go towards delivering emergency supplies such as shelter kits, water filters and blankets, according to the FCDO. The PM also told MPs that naval vessel HMS Trent had been ""pre-positioned in the region"" to provide support. As many as 8,000 Britons are understood to be in Jamaica and the FCDO has urged them to to receive updates on the hurricane. A specialist FCDO team has travelled to Miami to provide consular assistance to affected British nationals In a statement on X, King Charles said he and Queen Camilla had been ""deeply concerned and profoundly saddened to see the catastrophic damage caused by the ferocity of Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean"". ""Above all, our most heartfelt sympathy is with the families, friends and loved ones of those who have tragically lost their lives,"" the statement added. Hurricane Melissa - now a category three storm and headed towards the Bahamas - first hit Jamaica's southern coast with maximum sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) - the strongest on Earth so far this year. Those speeds were above those of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , one of the worst storms in history. With communications crippled, the true scale of the disaster remains unknown. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a ""disaster area"" on Tuesday, warning of ""devastating impacts"" and ""significant damage"" to hospitals, homes and businesses.

2025-10-30,Bird flu measures now 'regular thing' -farmer,science,BBC,"A farmer has said bird flu measures are becoming the new normal for people in the poultry industry. The latest restrictions came into effect from 00:01 GMT on Thursday and require owners to keep their flock on a strict lockdown in their housing to prevent the spread of the disease. East Yorkshire is among counties where keepers of more than 50 birds and sellers of poultry products, including honesty box eggs, are required to house their birds, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. John Holtby, who farms from Dowthorpe Hall, Skirlaugh, near Hull, said: ""It's becoming a regular thing now so we've sort of got to used to the idea it's going to happen."" UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said there and the action was aimed at trying to prevent any further spread. Mr Holtby said bird flu, otherwise known as avian influenza, could be ""very serious"" and lead to farmers' flocks being culled. ""All poultry keepers have a lot of money invested in these birds and we don't want to see anything happen to them prematurely,"" he said. ""Quite a few of them do like to go out, but it's a question of keeping them entertained, they're quite curious things."" Mr Holtby said he did not think the measures would impact the price of birds in the run-up to Christmas. The housing order, which is in place until further notice, means keepers must also keep feed and bedding inside, and cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry or captive birds. The rules do not apply to hobby keepers. Risk to human health remains low with properly cooked poultry, including eggs, still safe to eat, Defra said.

2025-10-31,Martha Kearney: I'm worried about Britain’s wildflowers - so I planted a meadow,science,BBC,"I always used their nicknames - ""eggs and bacon"" for birds-foot-trefoil (a native plant known for its yellow slipper-like petals) and ""bread-and-cheese"" for the young shoots of the British tree hawthorn, which my friends and I would eat. And pretend to like! We picked rosehips from hedges too, which we split open to make itching powder, perfect for playground pranks. But later in life, on my walks through the countryside, I began to notice dwindling numbers of wildflowers. I missed the grasslands, bursting with colour, that I'd so enjoyed in my childhood. According to the charity Plantlife, approximately 97% of wildflower meadows have been lost across the UK since the 1930s, while species-rich grassland areas, which used to be a common sight, are now among the most threatened habitats. ""It's definitely a story of severe overall decline, both in the cover of flowers but also the diversity,"" explains Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University. So, what will happen if there isn't more intervention to save wildflowers? What will the future look like? ""Awful, in a word,"" says Prof Potts. ""If we, let's say, take a scenario where we just continue business as usual as we are now, we will still keep losing our wildflowers. ""And with that, we lose the beneficial biodiversity like the pollinators and the natural enemies of pests."" As a bee lover I am on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow. Not just for the beautiful colours but for the vibrancy of the bees, butterflies and moths flying around, which need that habitat. Yet since then, I've come to understand that the loss of wildflowers could bring other perhaps more unexpected consequences too. ""The consequence will be for farmers,"" argues Prof Potts. ""They will get low yields and poor quality crops, consumers will have to pay higher prices. Our environment will be degraded, eroded, will have less wildlife. ""Many of them [wildflowers] produce nectar and pollen, which is super important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, that can pollinate crops."" Prof Daniel Gibbs, food security lead at the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, also has concerns about the long-term consequences. ""Over time, and alongside pressures from climate change and land degradation, this could make our food system more fragile, and negatively impact food security,"" he says - meaning we could, for example, find ourselves with more limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables. There are also studies showing that fields near wildflower-rich margins or meadows produce better-quality fruit and higher yields. ""Wildflowers can also support some bugs, like spiders and carabid beetles… [which] do an absolutely fantastic job in controlling some of the pests that we get on crops - that can either damage the crop or sometimes lower the quality of the produce,"" adds Prof Potts. He describes wildflowers as almost like little factories, pumping out beneficial bits of biodiversity that can help with food production. ""Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination,"" Prof Gibbs says. ""Or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices."" Multiple factors are behind the decline. Sarah Shuttleworth, a botanist with Plantlife, argues that certain intensive farming methods have contributed. But some intensive farming methods have also allowed farmers to grow food for the country - and farmers I spoke to pointed out that they face tough financial choices. Though there have been government subsidies in place for years, meaning farmers are paid by the government to support wildlife on their land, since Brexit the way these grants are paid has changed, with different schemes designed in each of the devolved nations. In England, there has been frustration in some quarters about the speed and rollout of the grants and the fact that some schemes have been paused - , though this is due to reopen, while others extended at the last minute, leaving farmers less able to plan ahead. Speaking about the SFI scheme, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told the BBC: ""We inherited farming schemes which were untargeted and underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses. ""We have changed direction to ensure public money is spent effectively, and last year all the government's farming budget was spent."" They also acknowledged that wildflowers are vital, providing food and habitats for pollinators and wildlife, as well as improving biodiversity, and added: ""We are backing farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history and under our agri-environment schemes we are funding millions of hectares of wildflower meadows."" As part of its new deal for farmers, Defra said it has committed nearly £250m in farming grants to improve productivity, trial new technologies and drive innovation in the sector. Mark Meadows, Warwickshire chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), maintains 6m (20ft) wildflower strips around many of his fields. He feared that without an extension to his current agreement with Defra he'd have to return some wildflower margins to crop production. ""I'd love [to] be profitable enough [to] say 'Look, we'll leave 5% of our farmland,'… but agricultural costs have gone up a lot,"" he says. Other farmers share similar tales. David Lord is a third-generation farmer in Essex and member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. ""I'm 47 and I've never known farming to be under so much strain,"" he says. Knowing what funding for nature recovery on farms will be in place in future years is, he says, crucial. ""It takes time and care and cost to maintain [wildflowers]... A lot of farmers aren't going to be minded to just keep these habitats in place without the funding."" There are some glimmers of hope. Prof Potts says there has at least been a slowdown in decline over the last couple of decades - and perhaps a limited recovery for some species. ""I think [this] reflects some of the agricultural practices that have been a bit more nature-friendly."" Nature writer, and author of Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, agrees that the decline in wildflowers is far from universal. Certain species such as cow parsley, yarrow and knapweed are in fact spreading, and he welcomes an influx of non-native plants and ""garden escapes"", such as snowdrop and buddleia. Even so, Prof Potts says: ""It is the most precious things that we're losing the most of."" This includes cornflowers, corncockle and corn marigold - what he terms the iconic British countryside flowers. And the overall decline is why my husband and I decided to create our own wildflower meadow from an overgrown arable field. There was a field next to our house, which I had put beehives in, with permission from the owner. I had often thought it would be wonderful to create a wildflower meadow around those hives, so when the opportunity arose to buy the field, we decided to go ahead. A conservation specialist advised us on where to buy the seed. It was particularly important to get some yellow rattle seed, which helps keep more dominant grasses in check. This in turn gives other wildflowers more opportunity to gain a foothold. Our first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field. The red was from poppies which came from the disturbed ground. The white was ox-eye daisies, bladder campion and wild carrot, with spires of bright blue from viper's bugloss. The colour has changed over time - the splash of red did not return, but different wildflowers arrived in their place. The most spectacular year was last summer. Orchid seeds I'd scattered many years before and almost forgotten about, managed to flower. We counted more than 100 bee orchids — which to a bee lover like me, was the climax of years of work. In fairness, I should admit it's years of my husband Chris's work. He found an old-fashioned seed fiddle for us to use — a hand-held device used to scatter the seeds in a controlled way, operated as though drawing a bow across a violin. He also cut the hay at the end of summer, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but ultimately finding a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way. Of course, many people are not in the fortunate position we found ourselves in, of being able to create a wildflower meadow. And in the UK, you cannot plant wildflowers just anywhere — you would most likely need the landowner's permission. But growing numbers of people are trying to create their own patches of wildflowers. Plantlife reports that more and more are joining its No Mow May initiative —  an annual campaign to let wildflowers grow freely, by packing away the lawnmower. Sarah Shuttleworth says just a small spot can make a difference, especially when it comes to pollinators. ""Anyone who has a patch of grass could do their bit… the idea is that you're recreating a meadow-type management scheme, but in a very, very micro scale."" The charity would like to see wildflower habitats being given the same kind of protection as other precious landscapes. Meanwhile Prof Potts thinks, ""We need a bit more of a radical think about how to support farmers to do the right thing."" New housing developments could also prove a way to create wildflower meadows. Under the government's Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, set up under the Environment Act, developers creating building sites are obliged to ensure the same amount of biodiversity at the end of the project, as they had at the start, plus 10%. Ben Taylor manages the Iford Estate, farming land near Lewes in Sussex. For a recording of Open Country on Radio 4, he showed me with great pride around a new wildflower meadow, which was part of a 90-acre site, funded as a pilot by the scheme. ""We have seen hares here now, which we never had a year or two ago, before we started doing this. So it's really exciting..."" But, I wondered, does it make sense to take all of those acres of land out of food production? Mr Taylor says the soil was poor there anyway. ""You have to have nature to be able to grow food,"" he adds. ""Because you need the pollinators as you need the ecosystem, the food chains, the soil webs and everything else to be able to grow food sustainably in the long-term - so I like to think of it as a reservoir of biodiversity."" Many ecologists also want us to look beyond the benefits the wildflowers provide for us. ""Those species are just valuable in their own right, regardless of what they do or what they provide… They've also got their own right to be,"" argues Dr Kelly Hemmings, associate professor in ecology at the Royal Agricultural University. Richard Mabey stresses a similar point. ""They are important, in my view, for ethical reasons, simply because they exist. ""Beyond that they are the infrastructure of all other life on the Earth, the fundamental base of the food chain.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjnlv8ejxo
2025-10-30,Online tip booking trial to continue despite criticism,science,BBC,"A local authority has decided to continue trialling an online tip booking system, despite it having been criticised as ""rubbish"" by some residents. Surrey County Council rejected calls to scrap the scheme being piloted at the Camberley and Lyne recycling centres after a The three-month trial, which began on 11 August and runs until 10 November, requires people to go online and book a 15-minute slot before visiting the two sites. Despite being slated as creating ""unnecessary red tape,"" Councillor Tim Oliver said it ""made sense to see it through"" until the end. Other critics of the tip trial accused it of penalising shift workers and families with unpredictable schedules, adding that it even risks deterring people from recycling altogether. Labour Councillor Robert King, who organised the petition, said some residents had found the system to be a ""complete farce"" due to lack of available slots and called for an immediate return to the former ""turn up and tip"" approach. However, Councillor Natalie Bramhall, cabinet member for property, infrastructure and waste, insisted it had been effective in cutting congestion and improving customer experience. ""It's not just about assessing the impact on congestion, it's also about improving the service for the future,"" she said. Council figures show the two sites received 19,582 visits between August and September, with 83% having pre-booked, according to the Of those surveyed, 75% found the system easy to use while 77% said the 15-minute slots were sufficient, according to the council. Mr Oliver added that once the trial ended on 10 November there would be a return to a non-booking system before evaluating all the feedback and deciding what happens next.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg77rnd45o
2025-10-30,Before and after: Satellite images reveal hurricane devastation in Jamaica,science,BBC,"With power down, problems with communications and navigating parts of the island treacherous, the authorities in Jamaica have not yet been able to give a detailed assessment of the damage inflicted by Hurricane Melissa. But the devastating impact of the Category 5 storm on communities is starting to be revealed by satellite imagery. BBC Verify has been examining the new images to try to piece together what has been destroyed and what has been left standing. Arguably the most striking impact can be seen in images of the southwestern coastal port of Black River. We can identify specific buildings that have been battered or in some cases destroyed. By comparing a satellite image taken on 9 February with one taken on 29 October - after the hurricane hit - you can see that the distinctive white roof of a building housing a market has been replaced by a gaping hole. A little further north, a café has been wiped off the map. At the top of the image, the red roof of a warehouse has disappeared. The outline of the fire station next to the market is still visible but the top of the building appears to have been torn off. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has described Black River as ""ground zero"" after sharing footage of the destruction there. Photographs of White House, a fishing village on the west coast of Jamaica which is home to several thousand people, reveal how it bore the brunt as Melissa made landfall with winds of up to 185 mph. Nearly every structure appears to have been damaged or destroyed. In particular, the buildings next to the beach appear to have razed to the ground. These include restaurants called Marva's and Pelican Lookout. The top of a large circular structure is now missing and further inland, along the main road, a cluster of shops has been hit hard. Fishing boats in the bay - seen in satellite imagery on 7 October - have disappeared. Part of of Montego Bay - one of Jamaica's most popular tourists destinations - now resemble a brown swamp. The shore on this section of the northwest coast has been transformed by the flood water which now stains the beach. Authorities say facilities at the port and industrial park were inundated. The container terminal, an oil storage facility and nearby water treatment plant were all badly affected, along with a sports complex. The mayor of Montego Bay, Richard Vernon, has called the place ""devastated"" and added that locals are doing all they can to look after each other. Montego Bay is a popular destination for cruise ships to dock and home to golf courses as well resorts next to the normally pristine white sand.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly199pygy2o

Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is also seeking permission to put up new timber fencing around the building, which is part of the site at Les Augres Manor. Jumping rats come from Madagascar where they are critically endangered. They are known as the Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat, and it is thought there could be fewer than five thousand of the animals remaining in the wild.

2025-10-31,Setback for farmland battery storage plan,science,BBC,"Residents may win their fight against proposals for a large battery storage facility on farmland after planning officers recommended the scheme be refused. Nearly 150 people objected to the proposed 99MW battery energy storage system (BESS) at New House Farm, off Luzlow Lane in Bagnall in the Staffordshire Moorlands. District Council planning officers recommended the application, submitted by Root Power, be refused on the grounds the project would be ""inappropriate development"", adding open fields would be replaced by industry. Root Power said the development was justified by the ""urgent need"" for battery storage to support renewable energy. The purpose of the BESS is to support the transition to renewable energy by allowing surplus electricity to be stored and released into the grid when needed. It would include 24 battery clusters, 12 transformers, a substation and various other structures, and would be connected to the Cellarhead substation. But planning officers had concerns over whether firefighters would have safe and convenient access to the site. Residents objecting to the plan cited risks of fire, pollution and harm to wildlife. A resident who lives next to the proposed site said: ""The toxic chemical smoke and fumes from a fire would directly affect my family. It would also impact on people using the common and driving through the area."" Another objector said the area was ""a haven for wildlife"", adding: ""The views across to the Roaches are stunning – high fencing and bright lights would ruin this area."" Two letters of support were received, highlighting potential environmental and investment benefits. However, officers concluded the harms outweighed the benefits, writing: ""While it is concluded that the land is 'grey belt' it does not satisfy all the criteria to be deemed not inappropriate. Therefore, the development is harmful by definition. ""The development would, in addition, compromise openness by replacing open fields with a development of industrial character and appearance."" The application will be decided by the council's planning committee next week.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dnr0g3ejdo
2025-10-31,Rare spider discovered by National Trust visitor,science,BBC,"A rare species of spider has been spotted at a National Trust conservation site, in what the charity believes is the first such sighting in the area. Just in time for Halloween, bosses said a visitor at Kinver Edge on the Staffordshire-Worcestershire border saw the secretive purseweb spider. The eight-legged critter is sometimes called Britain's ""mini-tarantula"" and was found in heathland around Kingsford Heath. Bosses said the tunnel-building spider had made a home in the diverse landscape, which was maintained to support nature and wildlife. ""As we were walking up through the heathland, I just noticed this very strange-looking spider,"" said Matthew Rigby, who discovered the creature. He put the photo through an AI app to help identify it, he added. ""I think this is the most excited I've been, finding anything on Kinver,"" he added. The British Arachnological Society . Most sightings are in the south of England, though there are ""scattered outposts"" elsewhere, it added. Kingsford Heath was restored by Worcestershire County Council about two decades ago, with its ongoing management now the responsibility of the National Trust. The trust said heathland was characterised by wide, open landscape, with scattered trees and low shrubs, such as gorse, heather and grasses. The sandy soils provide an ideal habitats for lots of invertebrates, including the purseweb spider, they said. National Trust rangers care for Kinver Edge by grazing livestock and cutting vegetation to control invasive plants to stop them being over-taken by bracken, scrub or woodland. National Trust countryside manager Ewan Chapman said the purseweb spider was a fascinating but elusive species. ""It spends most of its life underground, hiding in a silk-lined burrow capped with a camouflaged 'purse' of web. ""Unsuspecting insects walking over the surface are ambushed and dragged below."" He added: ""The discovery of the spider is regionally significant, as well as being a good indicator that our work to restore the heath on Kinver Edge is really paying off. ""It also goes to show the important role that our visitors can play by recording and sharing their wildlife sightings with us,"" said nature conservation adviser Andy Perry. Conservationists were now hoping to restore an area of conifer plantation, he added, with the aim of stopping the extinction of rare species on the site.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620n70ep66o

2025-10-30,UK charters flights to get Britons out of Jamaica,science,BBC,"The UK government has chartered flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Melissa. As many as 8,000 Britons are understood to be on the Caribbean island. The Foreign Office has urged them to register their presence to receive updates on the disaster response. It did not specify how many planes had been chartered, but said Brits and their immediate family would be able to take them as long as they held valid travel documents. The rare category five storm - the strongest type - made landfall on Jamaica on Tuesday, leaving a trail of destruction, flooding and dozens of people dead as it moved through the Caribbean. At least five people are known to have died in Jamaica, with at least another 20 fatalities confirmed in Haiti. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the chartered flights were to ""bolster commercial capacity and ensure people who wish to return to the UK can do so as soon as possible"". She added: ""The strong links between the UK and Jamaica mean many British nationals were there during the devastation of the hurricane, and we need to ensure they can get safely home, as we know how worrying and difficult the last few days will have been."" She said the UK government would be providing immediate humanitarian assistance to Jamaica, drawing on supplies in Antigua. The Foreign Office is urging those in Jamaica to contact their airlines first to see if commercial flights are available. It added that Windrush generations with indefinite leave to remain in the UK were also eligible for the government flights. Jamaica's Transport Minister Daryl Vaz said on Wednesday that some airports - including Norman Manley in Kingston - would initially open for humanitarian relief flights only. Some commercial flights from the capital, Kingston, are scheduled to begin operating again on Thursday. Sangster International Airport, which serves the badly-hit Montego Bay, will reopen on Thursday for relief flights, Vaz said, adding that it was unclear when commercial flights would resume. The Foreign Office announcement comes a day after the UK government pledged £2.5m to help with the relief effort, with the funds going towards delivering emergency supplies such as shelter kits, water filters and blankets. Technical experts have also been deployed to assist with the disaster response. Among the Britons stuck in Jamaica is Lyndsey Hookway from Devon, who has been sleeping on the floor in the lobby of the Iberostar Rose Hall Suites in Montego Bay since Tuesday. She said the hotel is ""completely trashed"" and has no running water or air conditioning. ""The hotel have been spectacular, they've been communicating with us and helping us as much as they can,"" she told the BBC. She added she has been trying to get through to the British consulate but ""the line is not connecting"". Paul Potter, his wife and teenage children are also staying at a resort in Montego Bay and were due to travel back to the UK on Monday, but their flights were cancelled. They have since been contacted by Virgin with alternative flights scheduled for Tuesday. ""We are very fortunate to be where we are with power and internet connection,"" Paul said, adding that the wider community is facing ""absolute chaos with no power and a lot of debris and destruction"". People in the UK have also faced difficulty contacting family and friends in Jamaica. Rayanne Walters, 26, from London, said her messages have not been delivered to her friend in Jamaica. ""We tried phoning him. After a few minutes - it cuts off,"" she told BBC Newsbeat on Wednesday. ""I've been really, really sad and feel heartbroken. I just really want to know my friends are okay."" Yvonne Williams, a teacher from Leeds, has also been unable to contact her sister; while Kyle Holmes, from Bolton, was visiting the Caribbean island with his wife and three young children for his mother's wedding when Hurricane Melissa struck. ""It was like being in a war zone - it was horrible,"" Mr Holmes told BBC North West Tonight. ""All the windows were shaking and things were getting thrown at us."" Melissa first hit Jamaica's southern coast with maximum sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) - the strongest hurricane so far this year. Those speeds were above those of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, one of the worst storms in history. With communications largely crippled, the full extent of the disaster remains unclear. Early images show homes and other structures razed to the ground, debris littering streets and fast-moving floodwater streaming through neighbourhoods. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a ""disaster area"" on Tuesday, warning of ""devastating impacts"" and ""significant damage"" to hospitals, homes and businesses. Three-quarters of the country had no electricity overnight and many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water. While Melissa has now cleared Jamaica and is moving towards the Atlantic, there will still be some thunderstorms across the island. The US National Hurricane Center warns that an additional 8-15cm (3-6 inches) of rain is possible in parts, with up to 76cm over mountainous areas, posing an ongoing risk of flash flooding and landslides. The remnants of Melissa are forecast to move across the UK next week. The weather system will move across the far north-west late on Sunday and into early Monday - likely as a largely ""business as usual"" storm, the Met Office said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8yw58w50eo
2025-11-01,Mr Kipling bakery to be powered by solar farm,science,BBC,"The bakery which produces Mr Kipling cakes and pies will soon be powered by the sun thanks to a £2.1m solar farm installed at the site in South Yorkshire. The 2.2mw solar farm has been installed on 2.9 hectares (7.2 acres) of land at Premier Foods' Carlton Bakery in Barnsley. Once it becomes fully operational later this month, it will power three-quarters of the factory's energy, from cake mixers to office lighting, the company said. Nick Brown, ESG Director at Premier Foods, said: ""By generating more of our energy needs on site, we're not only reducing our carbon footprint but making our operations even more resilient."" He said when the bakery opened in the 1970s it was the largest purpose-built bakery in the world, and it remains the biggest bakery in the UK. Mr Brown added: ""It's also positive that the solar farm has the capability to potentially export electricity back into the local electricity grid, when we are producing more electricity than we need."" The solar project is expected to reduce the factory's carbon emissions by 468 tonnes per year and deliver savings in annual energy costs, something it said will support the resilience of the business which is a key local employer. The Carlton Bakery is one of the region's largest food production facilities, employing up to 1,000 people at peak production. Steve Morton, Manufacturing Director and Factory General Manager at Carlton Bakery, added: ""The whole team is excited to see the solar panels go live. Carlton has been part of the community for over 50 years, and over that time the site has changed a great deal – this is the next really exciting step in its story.""

Rangers working with the West Cornwall Ringing Group said they recorded an average of 3.3 chicks per box in West Penwith, compared to 2.4 elsewhere in the wider area. Although below the long-term average of 4.3, the figures were described as ""successful"" by the charity, and driven by collaboration after a challenging spring that reduced prey numbers. Shaun Boyns, ranger in the West Cornwall countryside team said ""Barn owls are a great indicator species - when they're thriving, it's a sign the wider ecosystem is healthy too."" The charity said the results showed what was possible when there was a ""strong partnership between farmers, rangers and conservation groups"". It said it had also been an unusually successful year for bats too, especially at Godolphin near Helston, where nine species had been recorded. Habitat management, healthy hay meadows and connected woodland allowed insects to thrive - a vital food source for bats - and created the sheltered spaces they needed to feed, navigate and roost, it added. Bird numbers also rose across west Cornwall, with a reported 80% of surveyed sites showing an increase in bird species - Godolphin stood out again as a top performer. The National Trust said these findings ""reflect a bigger story... managing land for wildlife helps both nature and people, and it hopes to build on this success across Cornwall"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3mllkzp4o

Dominic Reardon, who lives in Arnside, Cumbria, travelled to Muker in North Yorkshire to photograph Comet Lemmon on 25 October. He said he was ""watching the weather forecast like a hawk"" before finally getting a gap in the clouds and his chance to take his photo. The comet, officially known as C/2025 A6, was detected in January by astronomers at the Mount Lemmon Survey in Arizona and will not return for 1,150 years. Mr Reardon, 29, said he took his photo of the comet by using a telephoto lens and a star tracker, which allows the camera to follow an object as it moves across the sky, in order to collect more light and image data. He took multiple exposures over a period of two hours from 19:00 until 21:00. ""I'd been trying to find a gap in the weather for two weeks and had tried a couple of times before, but I would get fully set up – which takes a good 30-45 minutes – only to have the night ruined by clouds, rain or wind,"" he said.

Guernsey Waste said a ""scary amount"" of waste was produced at the end of October  every year. It said the pieces of flesh removed when carving pumpkins could be used in recipes such as pumpkin lasagne, spicy pumpkin soup and autumnal pumpkin tart. The company said the more fibrous flesh from around the seeds could be home composted or put into the food waste caddy, along with the carved pumpkin. Waste minimisation and sustainability officer Douglas Button said islanders bought thousands of pumpkins each year to carve or for decoration. But he said the ""best - and tastiest- parts of the pumpkin"" were often forgotten and ended up being thrown away. Islanders are also being asked to think about the number of single-use plastics they consume during Halloween, from sweet wrappers to costume items. Mr Button said decorations and costumes could be reused in following years which also helped to save money.

""I think it's just following on from the trend in America... it's nearly as big as Christmas now."" Mr Le Maistre added that the event was part of a wider effort to connect people in Jersey with their produce.

2025-11-01,Public alerted after bird flu outbreak,science,BBC,"A public alert has been issued following a bird flu outbreak in East Sussex. Wealden District Council called on residents and businesses that house birds to be vigilant to signs of disease and report any suspected cases immediately. It comes after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it had confirmed ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" at a large commercial poultry unit near Uckfield. A 1.9-mile (3km) protection zone and a 6.2-mile and (10km) surveillance zone have been put in place around the site. All birds there will now be ""humanely culled"", according to Defra. , with transmission from birds very rare, say scientists. Wealden District Council said signs that birds have the virus include unusual quietness, decreased levels of activity, feeding and egg production. It advised that poultry keepers could protect their flocks by ensuring their living areas were clean and tidy, separating different species and preventing contact with wild birds. The Defra protection zone around the site means keepers need to make a record  of visitors, along with poultry numbers and movements. Owners are ordered to house captive birds or keep them isolated if housing is ""impractical or would adversely affect the birds' welfare to a significant degree"", Defra said. have been put in place, including restrictions on the movement of birds, use of poultry slurry and releasing of game birds. Failure to comply can be an offence under the 1981 Animal Health Act, Defra said.

2025-11-01,Comet caught on camera over Lancaster sculpture,science,BBC,"A photographer says he feels ""very lucky"" to have captured Comet C/2025 A6 as it appeared over the Lancaster bomber sculpture in Norton Disney. Also known as Comet Lemmon, it was first detected in January by stargazers at the Mount Lemmon Survey in the US. Steve Fearn, 52, from Lincolnshire, said it was ""quite a buzz, capturing something so unique"" as he pictured it over the life-size sculpture of the bomber, titled On Freedom's Wings, which honours RAF crews of World War Two. The image also shows a grey light going across the sky, which he said he believed was fuel from a Space X rocket. ""Comet Lemon is nice to look at because it has quite a distinctive blue ion tail, so it was quite satisfying,"" Mr Fearn added. ""I feel very lucky to have captured it,"" he said. . They are best known for their long tails. Mr Fearn said the image was captured by using a tracking mount, which counters the earth's rotation and follows objects in the sky. He added that he had struggled to record the comet due to recent weather. He said he had previously captured images of Comet Neowise and Comet Atlas. Comet Lemmon came closest to the earth on 21 October, when it was 56 million miles (90 million km) away. It is expected to be visible into the start of November.

2025-10-31,Water company warns of smell while leak fixed,science,BBC,"Guernsey Water has warned of a ""whiff"" while it works to fix a leaking valve in an underground sewage pumping station. White Rock pump station, underneath North Beach car park, normally deals with 350 litres (77 gallons) of sewage every second, the water company said. It said the station sent all the sewage from St Peter Port and St Martin's to the Belle Grave Wastewater Centre. The company said the valve needed to be removed for repairs, and said a big yellow pump had been placed in the car park to ""divert the flows"" and allow workers to safely carry out repairs . ""Because all that sewage is flowing through the pipes, there is somewhat of a whiff in the area – hopefully the strong winds will clear it, but there's not much more we can do to stop it,"" it said.

2025-11-02,Britons evacuated from Jamaica after Hurricane Melissa land in UK,science,BBC,"A flight chartered by the UK government to evacuate British nationals from Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Melissa has landed at Gatwick Airport. The flight, which left Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport on Saturday, comes after the UK flew in aid as part of a £7.5m regional emergency package. Some of the funding will be used to match public donations up to £1m to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those to have donated. Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, blocked roads have complicated distribution after Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 28 people. Melissa swept across the region over a number of days, leaving behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 31 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides. Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday ""there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened"". Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit. The UK Foreign Office has asked citizens there to register their presence and advised travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options were available. The UK initially set aside a £2.5m immediate financial support package for the region, with an additional £5m announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday as ""more information... on the scale of the devastation"" emerged. The British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) ""continue its lifesaving work"" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water. The Red Cross said that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters. Until the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital. So too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis. Meanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find. The BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue. Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others to drive to an area where they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island. The country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, described ""significant damage"" across a number of hospitals on Saturday - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected. ""That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,"" he said. ""The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services."" Dr Tufton added: ""What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet."" The minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a daily supply of water. Landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating the distribution of aid across the island. However, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief by Sunday. At least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out from Kingston on Saturday with a seven-truck convoy heading to Black River, the badly damaged town in western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida. Help is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter. It remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon. Melissa - the strongest hurricane so far this year - made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday, with sustained winds of up to 185mph (295km/h). A category five storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale is the strongest kind, with wind speeds in excess of 157mph, making hurricanes of this strength capable of catastrophic destruction.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg441qyv2xo
2025-11-02,"'No help, no food, no water': Hurricane-hit Jamaican towns desperately wait for aid",science,BBC,"Five days after Hurricane Melissa pummelled into western Jamaica with record force, residents in devastated communities along the coast are still desperately waiting for help. Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return. The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds. That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days. Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland. Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed. A long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history. Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction. On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill. A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic. ""We don't know what lies ahead,"" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as ""total devastation"". Those living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating. Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but ""they no turn up"". He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next. Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has ""nowhere to live"", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch. Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now."" About 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world. Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet. He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were ""several factors"" contributing to delays. ""Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,"" Vaz said on X. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the ""immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services"", as well as providing food and medical supplies. But that would only solve part of the problem. In a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood. ""We all devastated here, man,"" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now ""flat"". ""Melissa take everything down,"" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as ""mashed up"". Morris also told of ""no help, no food, no water"". ""We just have to try and see what we can do,"" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish. Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch. The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances. Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but ""we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still"". ""Can't give up. Not gonna give up,"" he said. It is the same tone struck by Oreth Jones, a farmer sitting in the bed of his truck selling pears, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes – the last of his produce that was spared from the storm. Of his farm, he said: ""It's all wrecked. They all destroyed."" But he quickly followed up with: ""We have to give God thanks we're alive."" Jones survived the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history while he was injured, wearing a homemade splint on his right leg from a fracture he suffered during a biking accident before Melissa hit. When asked about how the community will move forward, he said: ""Pray. Nothing else we can do. Nothing else."" Meanwhile, foreign aid has now started entering into Jamaica. The US State Department announced on Friday that its Disaster Assistance Response Team had arrived. And countries including the UK have also pledged millions in aid relief funds and emergency supplies.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv11w8ez10o
2025-11-02,Netherlands to return stolen ancient sculpture to Egypt,science,BBC,"The Netherlands has said it will return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt. It is ""highly likely"" the stone head, dating from the time of the pharaohs, was plundered during the Arab Spring in either 2011 or 2012, according to the Dutch  Information & Heritage Inspectorate. A decade later, it turned up at an arts and antiques fair in Maastricht and, following an anonymous tip-off, Dutch authorities determined it had been stolen and exported illegally. Dutch outgoing prime minister Dick Schoof made the pledge to hand it back as he attended the opening of the archaeological The Dutch government said the sculpture of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III is ""deeply meaningful to Egypt's identity"". The statue had been offered up for sale at The European Fine Art Foundation fair in 2022. The dealer voluntarily relinquished the sculpture after authorities had been tipped off about its illegal origin. The government said it expected to hand the stone head over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of this year. ""The Netherlands is committed both nationally and internationally to ensuring the return of heritage to its original owners,"" it said. The news comes as Egypt celebrated the opening of the enormous Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing its archaeological heritage this weekend. First proposed in 1992, the construction of the museum itself was interrupted by the Arab Spring. Costing around $1.2bn (£910m), the facility contains 100,000 artefacts, including the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun and his famous gold mask. Prominent Egyptologists are hoping the museum will strengthen demands for key antiquities held in other countries to be returned. These include the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, which is on display at the British Museum in London.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnve21y7lreo

Paignton Zoo in Devon said the ""adorable baby"", believed to be a girl, was born on 22 October after her 14-year old mother, Lola, gave birth in the monkey heights exhibit. It said the species was classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the zoo was one of 13 facilities across the UK which housed the ""incredibly rare"" species. James Shora, mammals keeper, said: ""Every birth of an endangered species is something to celebrate. This adorable baby is already captivating our visitors and represents real hope for the future of king colobus monkeys."" The zoo said keepers intended to name the baby king colobus monkey Limba, in honour of her father Limbali who passed away early in October. It said Lola and the baby were ""thriving and easily visible to visitors"". The zoo said king colobus infants were born white specifically to help mothers track them, as it was normal behaviour for babies to be passed around within the family group. It added: ""The baby will gradually develop the distinctive markings of this rare West African species over approximately six months, transforming into a jet-black coat with white facial fringes and a sweeping white shoulder cape."" Populations of the species had plummeted by more than 50% over the past three decades due to habitat loss, hunting, and forest fragmentation, the zoo said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lpx78qpxxo
2025-11-02,Overflowing bin hubs cause concern for residents,science,BBC,"Kate McNab is not happy with the new bin hub system outside her flat in Govan. Glasgow's tenement flats traditionally kept their bins in their back courts but the council has been rolling out new shared bin hubs across the city which have been placed on the street in front of people's homes. The council says the new hubs will improve recycling, clean up the back court areas and create a safer work environment for bin men, who have previously warned of a ""severe health and safety crisis"" due to rat infestations. But Kate is one of numerous residents who say the new system has not delivered what was promised. ""Our back court was immaculate, and now we've got overflowing bins, smells, flies, and nowhere to put anything,"" she says. Other residents have also complained that there is now less space for waste and the new bins are being emptied much less often than they were told they would be. One called it a ""hygiene disaster"", with plastic bags left by the side of the hubs spilling their contents on the street. The rollout of the new bin hubs in Govan, Ibrox and Cardonald followed pilot schemes in Pollokshields, Haghill and Finnieston in 2023. During the pilot, the council told BBC Scotland it acknowledged key concerns around access, odours, fly-tipping, and missed collections. To fix this, it promised and daily monitoring to prevent overflow and antisocial behaviour. Yet, in Govan, residents like Kate say those same issues have resurfaced. The council insists the general waste from the new bin hubs is being collected every four days, double the previous collection time of eight days for the back court system, but Kate says that's ""a complete joke"". ""So much for these four days,"" she says, ""it's not happening."" She reports bins overflowing for more than eight days, claiming her street is repeatedly missed while nearby areas are serviced. Under the previous system, a close with six flats would have a 240 litre capacity general waste bin per flat, which would be emptied every eight days. This would give 30 litres of general waste bin space per day for each household. Each new hub includes two general waste bins of 1,200 litres each, which the council say on average support 30 households in Govan. This offers 18.75 litres of general waste bin space a day per household. The council states that the overall space, including recycling, has increased to 31 litres per day, a similar amount of space they had with the previous system. ""Due to the frequency of collection the capacity for waste containment in the hub rises significantly,"" the council says. Residents still maintain there has been a reduction in space, despite the increase in recycling options and - combined with missed collections - this is contributing to bins overflowing more frequently. Catherine Robertson, another Govan hub user, says the bins on her street are ""overflowing constantly"". She says: ""The rubbish is getting picked up every 10 days if you're lucky. The street's a mess. My house stinks because we can't take the rubbish out every day."" Catherine has mobility issues and uses a wheelchair, and says the bins are inaccessible for her. ""The bin hubs are just too big and not suitable for disabled people, it was easier before"", she says. The accessibility issue was flagged during the 2023 pilot programme in Pollokshields and the council said that residents with mobility issues would be assessed on an individual basis and alternative options would be considered. Catherine says this has not happened. ""They've spent millions on this, and they didn't even think about elderly or disabled people,"" she adds. According to Kate McNab, placing the new hubs in front of people's flats has created another issue. ""They promised the bin hubs wouldn't smell,"" she says. ""It's October and they already stink, and they've only been in two weeks."" ""I've already started seeing flies since they put them in. My house has never stunk before, and now it does."" She says her elderly neighbour Jim has a hub right outside his window. ""The man is sitting at his bedroom window looking out onto a bin hub,"" she says. ""Poor Jim says every time he opens his window, all he can smell is bins."" The council said the improved collection frequency reduced the risk of odours or flies. ""We have not received any complaints on this matter since the introduction of the hubs,"" it said. David McGowran, another Govan resident, says the bins are not locked, meaning there are ongoing issues with fly tipping which also cause the bins to overflow. ""I can clearly see the bin hubs being used by the kebab shop and the off-licence across the road,"" he says. ""Big oil canisters and boxes not from any flat here."" David called it a ""hygiene disaster"" and says he is concerned that moving bins from the back courts to the street has simply shifted, rather than solved, the city's vermin problem. ""Seagulls, squirrels, foxes, they all get into the bins. If a black bag is sitting on top, the seagull is going to tear it right open"", he says. There is also worry that rats, previously contained to more hidden areas, are now being drawn to the overflowing hub bins on the street, increasing the risk of infestations near homes and parked cars. The council said bin hubs were for residents only and said monitoring teams would follow up with businesses ""to remind them of their responsibilities on waste disposal"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e51z88jlo
2025-11-02,Bronze Age coracle recreated 50 years after its discovery,science,BBC,"A reconstruction of a Bronze Age coracle has been completed 50 years after the prehistoric boat was discovered buried in Fife. In 1975, a farmer ploughing a field at Barns Farm at Dalgety Bay uncovered a Bronze Age cemetery and three graves with people buried in coracles. Jeremy Usher Smith, of Newtonmore's , based his reconstruction on archaeological evidence gathered from the site. The Barns Farm coracles, along with one , are believed to be the oldest in the world. Mr Usher Smith used willow and hazel to construct the boat using techniques that have almost remained unchanged for 4,000 years. The frame was then covered in a heavy woven textile called calico and waterproofed with bitumen paint. In the Bronze Age the frame would have been covered in cow, horse or seal skin. The finished reconstruction is almost 2m (6.5ft) long. Unlike modern coracles there is no seat, and the person paddling has to kneel down in the bottom of the craft. Mr Usher Smith said he believed the shape was similar to coracles still in use on the River Teifi in west Wales. He said: ""There was a lot of discussion after about the shape and how it was made."" Mr Usher Smith also suggested that the Bronze Age boat was used at sea rather than on rivers due to where it was found near the Firth of Forth. It has a high stern which would have been suited to use in waves. Mr Usher Smith said a dump called a midden, found near the cemetery, contained a large amount of shellfish. He said: ""The logic is that if you've got a coracle then you'd be able to go out to all these little islands and rocks that were exposed at low tide. ""And so they were obviously harvesting shellfish and doing it for several hundred years to get this quite sizeable midden. ""Things like crab and lobster as well I should think."" There are no other examples of a sea-going coracle in Britain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7m4yy0k0zo
2025-11-02,Hurricane Melissa death toll rises to 28 in Jamaica,science,BBC,"The number of people killed in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa has risen to 28, the Caribbean nation's prime minister has announced. Andrew Holness confirmed nine other deaths on Saturday, adding that there were reports of possible fatalities still being verified - suggesting the figure may yet rise. Emergency responders and aid agencies have struggled to reach certain parts of the island in the aftermath of the storm due to blocked roads, debris and flooding. The category five hurricane - the strongest type - has caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, bringing powerful winds and landslides to Cuba and Haiti. The full scale of the destruction Melissa wrought on Jamaica has only become clear in the past few days as the hurricane knocked out communication systems and power to much of the island after it made landfall on Tuesday. Communities on the island's western portion, such as Black River and Montego Bay, have seen the worst of the destruction. Images have emerged showing buildings razed to the ground, debris and belongings strewn on streets, and whole neighbourhoods still under floodwater. The Red Cross says that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters. Jamaican officials confirmed to news agency AFP that multiple field hospitals were being established to treat people in the worst-affected areas in the west. Aid reaching those in need was initially held up by the temporary closure of Jamaica's airports. Now that it is arriving in the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating its distribution. With so many in need of clean drinking water, food and medicine, there have been reports of desperate people entering supermarkets and pharmacies to gather what they can. Melissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean. At its peak, the hurricane had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph. At least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic. In Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e34p92q0vo
2025-11-02,Gallery turned into court for climate exhibition,science,BBC,"A gallery has been transformed into a court room as artists put the former British East India Company on ""trial"" for alleged, historic climate crimes. It is the first time the immersive exhibition, Court for Intergenerational Climate Crimes, has been staged in the UK outside of London. Created by academic, writer and lawyer Radha D'Souza and artist and researcher Jonas Staal, the installation opened at Leeds Arts University's Blenheim Walk Gallery on Friday. Curator Marianna Tsionki said it was a ""brilliant opportunity"" and offered a different artistic experience to the city's other galleries. Founded in 1600, the British East India Company started as a trading business but became a powerful force that shaped the history of India and the British Empire. The exhibition, which was commissioned by the Serpentine Galleries in London, focuses on the environmental fallout of the company's activities up until its dissolution in 1874. Ms Tsionki said: ""It's our core focus to raise questions within the university, not only for the benefit of our student and academic community, but for the benefit of the city. ""The uniqueness of the Blenheim Walk Gallery relies on this idea of operating within an academic environment, but not isolated from the rest of the cultural production of the city."" On Friday, audience members had the opportunity to take part in the tribunal as jury members. As well as the live public hearing, the exhibition includes a recording reviewing the evidence of the public hearings in London earlier this year. Ms Tsionki said: ""Even if audiences don't get a chance to engage, to participate in the public hearing, they still get a sense of how those two elements work together and complement each other. ""What is really important is this historical connection. And also making a point that the climate crisis is not isolated from previous decisions."" The exhibition, which runs until 31 January, also includes lightboxes displaying plants linked to the East India Company's operations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl25zzz2wpo

2025-11-02,Walkers protest over riverbank access,science,BBC,"Campaigners have taken to the banks of the River Dart as part of a ""mass trespass"" over the right to roam on riverbanks in England. About 30 Right to Roam activists gathered along the river in Galmpton, Devon, calling on the government to review its manifesto pledge to ""create nine new National River Walks"". The campaign group said the pledge was ""unworkable"", adding that landowners were blocking public access. A Defra spokesperson said ""too many people"" had been ""left without access to the great outdoors"", adding the government was ""increasing access to nature and the countryside"" with the creation of the new river walks, three new national forests, and a new coast path. Right to Roam wants the government to pass new legislation giving the public a ""default right of responsible access"" to all rivers, and further protests are planned across the country this month. Guy Shrubsole from the group, who lives in Totnes, said: ""The River Dart is obviously wonderful, people love going and trying to swim in it and enjoy it, but there are huge stretches of it that don't have any public access."" Mr Shrubsole said it had carried out an analysis earlier this year, which showed there were 108 separate landowners along the River Dart. ""When we see what the government is saying... firstly, we think that is very inadequate, there are 1,500 rivers in Britain, so a mere nine river walks is simply pathetic,"" he said. ""If every river is like the Dart, with 108 separate landowners on it, we're talking about thousands of landowners the government is going to have to negotiate access with to create these new permissive river walks that they're talking about."" Mr Shrubsole said Right to Roam wanted a ""new social contract"" between landowners and the public. ""We have huge sympathy with the idea of landowners feeling that they have some sort of legal responsibility,"" he said. ""Ultimately, what we're talking about is reduced landowner liability in return for greater access, and that's actually what's happened in both Scotland, but also under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act in England, which gives us a partial right to roam but so far excludes rivers from those rights of access."" A Defra spokesperson said: ""Our countryside and green spaces are a source of great national pride, but too many people across the country have been left without access to the great outdoors. ""We are increasing access to nature and the countryside, creating nine new National River Walks, three new national forests, and the 2700-mile King Charles III England Coast Path is also nearing completion.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l79p9k8x6o

Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission. ""I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,"" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition. ""There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,"" she reads. Kardashian appears to be referring to . During that exchange, Aldrin does not seem to suggest that the expedition did not happen, but instead that a scary moment did not happen. However, he is then prompted to recite an anecdote about a broken circuit breaker. In her conversation with Paulson, Kardashian is later seen telling a producer that she believes the Moon landing was fake. ""I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen,"" she says. ""He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin.""

2025-11-04,Fines of £100 as council bin inspectors check every home's rubbish,science,BBC,"Every single household in one council area has had their black bin waste inspected at some point over the past eight years, it has been revealed. Blaenau Gwent enforcement officials have been out to more than 32,000 properties since 2017 in order to check black bin bags and monitor households for effective recycling, councillors were told. The strategy was discussed during a scrutiny committee meeting focusing on the 2024-25 report on the local authority's waste and recycling performance. The report showed the recycling rate went up from 66.18% in 2023-24, to 68.89% in 2024-25, but was still below the target of 70%. ""Over the last six to eight years every property in the county borough has had an enforcement visit, so that's over 32,000 homes,"" said Andrew Long, who manages the council's frontline enforcement services. ""The work involves taking a black bag out of someone's presented residual waste, photographing and logging it, and taking it to the Silent Valley HWRC (Household Waste and Recycling Centre) and examining it for any recyclable material it might contain. ""If people are identified as putting out recyclate in their residual waste then we take an enforcement process which involves serving a legal notice and FPN (fixed penalty notice), and prosecution if that isn't paid."" The fine can be £100, but Mr Long said waste wardens prioritised promoting the campaign, created to ensure every household in Blaenau Gwent recycles. ""There's a large body of work that the guys do proactively - in addition to the crews - notifying us where waste is being presented on collection days. ""We will subsequently monitor those addresses if there's repeat offending,"" he added. ""We're very proactive when it comes to targeting non-compliant properties."" Rassau and Garnlydan councillor Gareth Alban Davies also stressed the positive impact of waste wardens. ""A lady contacted me to say that she put out four black bags every three weeks and felt she was recycling everything,"" he said.

The capital has seen 808 wildfires rage in the last seven years, which cost the London Fire Brigade (LFB) more than £5.4m to respond to, according to figures from the mayor of London. This year alone, there have been 21 wildfire incidents, prompting the LFB to deploy 4,022 personnel in response and costing £766,000, City Hall said. Meanwhile, the cost of tackling floods since 2018 reached £5.8m this year, including £557,000 for 195 incidents in 2025, according to the Leonie Cooper, Labour's environment spokesperson on the London Assembly, said: ""This is not a warning of what climate change might do, this is what it is doing to London today.""

2025-11-03,Firms ordered to reduce forever chemicals in drinking water sources for 6 million people,science,BBC,"Water companies have been ordered to tackle potentially harmful levels of so-called forever chemicals in drinking water sources for more than six million people, the BBC can reveal. Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are a group of thousands of substances used in everyday products. They are persistent pollutants which build up in the environment, and a small number have been linked to increased risk of some serious illnesses. The BBC examined 23 enforcement notices issued by the Drinking Water Inspectorate over elevated levels of PFAS which could ""constitute a potential danger to human health"" to see how many people were affected. Industry body Water UK said it was confident drinking water was safe. But Water UK called for a ban on the chemicals to prevent accumulation. Amid growing worries about these chemicals, water companies have been required since 2021 to test for 47 of the most concerning ones in water supplied to customers' homes and drinking water sources such as aquifers and reservoirs. In the last four years, 1.7 million tests for individual forever chemicals have been carried out across the network. At least 9,432 of those recorded PFAS levels above the level which the DWI says When a test result is above or likely to breach this level - set at 0.01ug/L - (micrograms per litre) the Drinking Water Inspectorate issues enforcement notices to the water company requiring action to be taken to ensure water is safe. The BBC analysed the enforcement documents, highlighted by Watershed Investigations - a group of environmental journalists - to identify all the water supply areas with sanctions in place. Using publicly available information, we matched each supply system to the number of customers it serves, identifying a minimum of six million people. Forever chemicals have been used prolifically since the 1940s in thousands of products from frying pans to medical equipment to school uniforms. Over time they have found their way into the environment - and the water that gets treated for drinking - through the washing of PFAS products, storm runoff and releases from industrial sites, according to Dr William Hartz, an environmental chemist specialising in PFAS at research institute NILU in Norway. He said this might include PFAS leaching out as rainwater filters through landfill sites or firefighting training sites, where the use of some firefighting foam directly releases forever chemicals into the environment. The study of PFAS is an emerging field but a small number of these chemicals have been identified as carrying significant risks to human health. Earlier this year the World Health Organization PFOA as carcinogenic, and PFOS as possibly carcinogenic - . Both substances are now banned. But Megan Kirton, senior projects officer at environmental charity Fidra, said the chemistry of PFAS meant they do not easily break down, so even if banned they remain in the environment unless treated by water companies. ""It's a very tough situation that we're in, because PFAS is very hard to get out of water. It's like trying to get milk out of your coffee once you've already poured it in there,"" she said. The BBC assessed more than 2,000 individual test results from 2024, obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, to identify which specific PFAS compounds were being found when levels breached the limits. This showed that both PFOS and PFOA were found in more than 350 of the drinking water tests. The Drinking Water Inspectorate has said that water quality remains safe because, once a sanction is issued, water companies are required to increase testing, change or strengthen treatment for PFAS, or remove a source of drinking water altogether. This process can take several years and requires months of monitoring before a sanction is removed. The inspectorate told the BBC that it ""operates one of the world's most comprehensive PFAS monitoring programmes"", ensuring the public can have ""complete confidence in the safety of their drinking water"". However, environmental charities and the Royal Society of Chemistry have raised concerns that UK guidelines are not legally binding and that the limits, which are 2.5 times higher than those of the US, should be reduced. ""I think we have a pretty good idea of both what PFAS are in the waters in the UK, and knowing that these health effects happen at very low levels, so we think it's time that they put these guidance into law, to make sure water companies are fully held to account,"" said Stephanie Metzger, policy adviser at the Royal Society of Chemistry. into the England and Wales' water system commissioned by the government found that ""there is a need for stricter treatment requirements to protect public health and the environment"". The BBC understands that the government is currently preparing a white paper in response to the review which will include changes to the Drinking Water Inspectorate. But removing PFAS is very challenging for water companies with conventional water treatment infrastructure, Prof Peter Jarvis, professor of water science and technology at Cranfield University, said there were technologies such as nanofiltration occasionally deployed by the water industry which could be used more widely, but that these came with high costs and huge energy demands. ""We have got to have a bit of a more mature conversation about how we go about implementing these types of technology, and how we pay for them,"" he said. Water UK told the BBC that: ""Regardless of where you are in the country, when you turn on your tap, you are enjoying the very best drinking water in the world"". But speaking to the Today programme, CEO David Henderson said that in light of the rising treatment costs the chemicals should be banned. ""This £70m we are spending each and every year should be paid for by the chemical companies, it is really unfair for people through their water bills to have this added on top,"" he said. In addition to the comment from Water UK, a spokesperson from South West Water said that the five notices against it were ""precautionary"" and that it was ""investing £42 million over the next five years to upgrade the water supply system."" to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

2025-11-05,More than 85 dead as typhoon wreaks havoc in the Philippines,science,BBC,"people have been killed while hundreds of thousands fled their homes as one of strongest typhoons this year ripped through the central Philippines, authorities say. Typhoon Kalmaegi has flooded entire towns on the most populated central island of Cebu, where at least 49 of the fatalities were located. There are 75 others missing and 17 injured, officials said on Wednesday. Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets. The official death toll, which is likely to rise, includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts. The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help. ""Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,"" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew. The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h). It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday. But residents across Cebu province are still reeling from the deadly floods. More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, according to a report on Wednesday by the national disaster agency. Jel-an Moira Servas, a business owner who lives in Mandaue city, told the BBC that she found herself waist-deep in water within minutes when her house became flooded. She quickly evacuated with her family, bringing only light items like food and electronics. ""Right now, the rain has completely stopped and the sun is out, but our houses are still filled with mud, and everything inside is in shambles,"" she said. ""We don't even know where to start cleaning. I can't even look at it without crying."" Rafaelito Alejandro, the deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence told local radio station DZMM that the current challenge for rescuers was clearing ""debris and cars on the road"". Carlos Jose Lañas, a volunteer rescuer, told the BBC that despite preparing for the worst case, they were caught off-guard by the extent of the flooding. ""This is the worst flood I've ever experienced,"" the 19-year-old said. ""Almost all the rivers here in Cebu overflowed. Even emergency responders did not expect this kind of scenario."" ""The rescue operation was too overwhelming for the emergency responders around Cebu, because there were a lot of people asking for help."" In a Facebook post, Cebu governor Pamela Baricuatro described the disaster as ""unprecedented"". ""We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,"" she said. ""The floodwaters are just devastating."" Baricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts. Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities. Damage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses. Don del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged. ""I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,"" he told the AFP news agency. The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year. The latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops. Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong. In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption. after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage.

2025-11-05,Couple's shock after refuse collector 'mixed rubbish',science,BBC,"A couple have questioned whether their local bin collection system is ""a bit of a sham"" after footage appeared to show a refuse collector tipping the contents of all three bins into the same lorry. Angela and Andrew Hill, from Buxton, in Derbyshire, were woken by the arrival of the bin lorry on a Thursday - not their usual collection day. They said they looked on in confusion as their security footage showed the refuse  collector disposing of recycling, garden waste and general rubbish into the one lorry. High Peak Borough Council said it believed it to be an ""isolated incident"" which did not reflect ""usual practice"". Residents of Buxton have a grey bin for general waste, a brown one for recycling and a green-lidded bin for garden waste and food. Seeing the contents of the three bins mixed together has left the Hills frustrated. Mrs Hill said: ""You do think 'are we being sold a bit of a pup?' Or is it really going to be recycled? ""I think, like most people, you feel it's all sort of a duty to recycle - you want to do your bit to make sure the waste is properly sorted. ""We've got a plethora of bins and the street is filled with bins and you feel, if you're not actually recycling, why do we need this great load of bins that are sort of a mess?"" The Hills have raised the issue with High Peak Borough Council, but have said they have not received a reply. On the council's website, it said most residents would have seen changes to their scheduled collection days from the 20 October onwards. Mr Hill said the system was usually very good with recycling efforts but this particular refuse collection raised questions. He added: ""You wonder 'is this something that happens a little more frequently?'"" ""What does happen to our recycling after it's actually gone into the lorries?"" Household rubbish is usually taken from Buxton to Derbyshire County Council waste management centres run by contractors. They attempt to make sure rubbish is correctly sorted before delivering appropriate waste for recycling, composting green and food waste, and sending the rest to generate energy in incinerators. After being made aware of the video by BBC News, High Peak Borough Council said it had investigated with its waste collection partner, Alliance Environmental Services. The council said: ""We believe this to be an isolated incident which had occurred due to operational pressures outside of their control, the collection method does not reflect usual and standard collection practice for separated waste streams.

2025-11-04,Future Farming fund criticised for 'inconsistencies',science,BBC,"The Scottish government has come under fire from some farmers and crofters over the allocation of grants for the Future Farming Investment Scheme (FFIS). About 7,500 applications were submitted for the £21m fund which aimed to boost productivity, sustainability and efficiency within the agriculture sector. However, about 3,500 applications did not meet the eligibility criteria with some farmers and politicians claiming the distribution of money was ""unfair"". Minister for Agriculture and Connectivity Jim Fairlie said he understood some people would be disappointed and added that the Scottish government was already reviewing the scheme. National Farmers Union Scotland (NFUS) president Andrew Connon said the organisation was pleased for members who had secured funding. But he added that others were left disappointed despite submitting what they believed to be ""strong and eligible"" applications. He said: ""Initial feedback from our members has focused around perceived inconsistencies in how applications have been assessed and the low success rate among the ministerial priority groups. ""Clearly these issues need to be better understood in the days and weeks ahead and we will be seeking further discussions with the Scottish government to do so."" Mr Connon added that NFUS was working with the Scottish government on how the next round of FFIS could be shaped to meet its members' needs, and ensure lessons were taken forward. Andrew Parker runs a small sheep farm near Lockerbie in Dumfries and Galloway. He applied for a £5,000 grant to help improve the grassland and electric fencing on his farm. Mr Parker said his agricultural advisor provided guidance with the application and he felt optimistic about his chances. However, he was unsuccessful and said the current scheme was ""unfair"". Mr Parker said: ""It needs to be more consistent. ""It was borderline ridiculous in terms of what you could apply for - pretty much anything that didn't have an engine. ""One person can get a brand-new feeder wagon at £40,000 and somebody else trying to do what the grant was for, in terms of land improvements with better drystone walling, was declined. It doesn't make sense."" Torcuil Crichton, Labour MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar, claimed the Scottish government promised to focus the funding on supporting island communities. But he said less than 1% had been allocated to applicants in the Western Isles, with many crofters missing out despite paying for professional help to assist with the application process. Crichton said: ""Only 18 small businesses in the Western Isles had support under this scheme - that's four in the whole of Lewis and 14 in the Uist."" The MP said parts of mainland Scotland had secured support. He claimed: ""It looks like most of the money has gone to the usual suspects, the wealthy farming community."" Crichton has written to Fairlie calling for a review of the scheme and asking for an explanation of the decision-making process. Fairlie refuted claims that the scheme was unfair and emphasised the Scottish government's support for crofters. He said: ""We have the Crofting Agricultural Grant Scheme, which is only for crofters, the Crofting House Grant Scheme, which again is only for crofters. ""We put a considerable amount of money into crofting every year. ""I was in shepherding and farming for a long, long time, so I understand the vagaries of this industry probably better than most."" Fairlie said the scheme was under review and lessons would be learned moving forward. He said: ""It may be that the next time we have to make it more difficult because we made this very broad - we made it very generous. ""We were giving up to 100% for applicants to apply for 100% of the funding. ""Perhaps that was too generous."" Meanwhile Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston said there were serious questions to be answered regarding how the scheme was operated. He said: ""The lack of detail from Jim Fairlie simply will not cut it. He must urgently come clean as to exactly why many applicants were rejected and why this whole process turned into a lucky dip for the thousands who applied."" Mr Fairlie said he was disappointed that the funding scheme appeared to have turned into a game of political football.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3epdvy95lzo

While the law banning biodegradable municipal waste from going to landfill will still come into effect from the end of the year, the regulator will not implement the ban as long as conditions are met. Waste managers and landfill operators will have to apply for a six month exemption which can be renewed repeatedly until 31 December 2027. One waste analyst described the solution as a ""fudge"". The ban applies to almost all domestic and commercial waste which has not been separated out for recycling. The Scottish government is seeking to distance itself from the delay, saying that enforcement is an operational matter for the independent environmental regulator. Sepa insists Scotland has made significant progress in reducing the amount of waste going to landfill and that a ""pragmatic, time-limited"" delay is the most responsible approach. A spokesperson added: ""In reaching this decision, we carefully considered all available evidence to ensure that residual waste is managed appropriately, in line with government policy and with the lowest possible carbon impact."" The BBC Disclosure series revealed in June the extent of concerns within the industry about the level of preparedness for the ban. In the first year, 600,000 tonnes of waste would have nowhere to go in Scotland because of a lack of additional capacity at incinerators. The documentary revealed that most of that rubbish would have to be transported to England or overseas for processing if the ban came into force. One expert said that equated to between 80 and 100 lorries crossing the border each day and there were even concerns that there wasn't the transportation capacity to move the waste. Alasdair Meldrum, director of waste management consultants Albion Environmental, said the delay was not unexpected as the ban was going to cause ""significant disruption."" He added: ""The practical reality is that waste-to-energy, with the current rate of landfill tax, is less expensive than landfill so there will be commercial pressure on operators to use that wherever possible."" But he warned that delays by the regulator in allowing waste to go to landfill could lead to backlogs when incinerators break down. As well as the visual impact on communities, landfill is seen as the least environmentally sustainable way of handling waste. It involves dumping the waste in a huge hole in the ground and covering it over with soil. Landfill taxes have made the option progressively more expensive that incineration, where the rubbish is burnt in a furnace to create electricity. Efforts to encourage us to recycle have barely budged the dial in Scotland, even though rates in the rest of the UK are higher - much higher for Wales. Several new incinerators are either in planning or construction which should close the capacity gap within two years. Longer term concerns about overcapacity at incinerators led ministers to announce in 2022 that no more would be allowed beyond those already under consideration. Friends of the Earth Scotland has long argued that incineration should not be seen as the solution to dealing with waste and that more investment is needed in waste reduction and recycling. Campaigner Kim Pratt added: ""Rather than allowing these costly and damaging policies to continue, the Scottish government must close the loopholes in its incinerator moratorium and properly invest in the real solution to waste management: reduce, reuse and recycle.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj97renygrzo
2025-11-05,Bathing spot failed to meet water standards over blue-green algae,science,BBC,"A section of Lough Neagh designated for swimming failed to meet minimum standards for the bathing season, but is currently deemed satisfactory. An ""advice against bathing"" had been in place at Rea's Wood on the Antrim shore of the lough since July, due to blue-green algae. It was the only one of 33 identified bathing waters across Northern Ireland to receive a ""poor"" classification from June to September. The Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs minister confirmed that bathing restrictions in place there since July because of blue-green algae have been lifted. Andrew Muir said he was ""glad"" to see 24 bathing waters meeting the ""excellent"" standard but added there was ""still a lot more to do"" to improve water quality. ""We have all seen the devastating scenes at Lough Neagh. I am therefore disappointed but sadly not surprised that Rea's Wood in Lough Neagh failed to meet the minimum standards,"" he said. ""It is encouraging to see that three sites have improved in classification this year: at Brompton, Cushendall and Ballyholme."" Five other waters met the ""good"" standard while the remaining three were classed as ""sufficient"". Blue-green algae was present in Lough Neagh for a third summer since the crisis began in 2023. As well as advice against bathing notices around the Lough, beaches on the North Coast were also affected by bathing bans during the summer, due to algae arriving via the Lower Bann. The minister said it was ""really concerning"" that this had happened again, with some bathing notices put in place in October. ""As recently as last week at Portstewart, my officials have had to issue advice against bathing. ""I am glad to be able to announce that we have been able to lift the and Rea's Wood.  I want to thank our Bathing Water Operator partners who have worked with us in getting the messages out to the public quickly and consistently throughout the season.""

2025-11-05,Trump U-turns to renominate billionaire for Nasa chief,science,BBC,"Donald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination. The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a ""thorough review of prior associations."" While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk. Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also became last year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled. Why Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was ""pleased to nominate"" Isaacman for the role. ""Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,"" the president wrote. The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job. It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even though , the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that ""it will be an honor"" to serve in the role. ""The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,"" , that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. ""I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations."" Sean Duffy, the head of the transport department, has been interim Nasa chief since July. Isaacman's initial nomination withdrawal came just days after , following a tumultuous drive to shrink the size of government departments with his Doge initiative, leading to thousands of job cuts. Concerns were voiced over Isaacman's ties to Musk and his SpaceX company, where Isaacman has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He has also made donations to the Democrats in past elections. His nomination has encountered scepticism, and at his initial confirmation hearing in April, members of both parties questioned Isaacman about possible conflicts of interest, budget cuts and his desire to send astronauts to Mars. They expressed fears he would sacrifice the long-planned Moon mission to focus on Mars, but Isaacman said both can be possible. ""We don't have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars, or Moon has to come first versus Mars,"" he later added. The billionaire - who was a high-school dropout - made his fortune from payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which he founded in 1999 in his parents' basement when he was 16. Isaacman has a longstanding interest in flying - having first taken pilot lessons in 2004 and later setting a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world in a light jet.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ze3r1xrro
2025-11-05,Water bosses' bonuses blocked over pollution issues,science,BBC,"Six water companies have been blocked from paying bonuses to bosses over serious pollution incidents and other performance issues. More than £4m of potential bonuses were banned under new rules on performance-related executive pay, according to regulator Ofwat. The powers were introduced in June as a result of concerns that the pay of water firms' top bosses was not reflecting their environmental performance. The six companies - Thames Water, Anglian Water, Southern Water, United Utilities Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water - blocked payouts for a variety of failures, mostly involving pollution. The new rules mean companies are required to block annual bonuses and other awards to directors where they do not comply with the watchdog's rules. This includes pollution incidents, poor environmental practices and criminal convictions. Ofwat said that a further £2.4m of performance-related executive pay was not required to be blocked, but should not be funded by customers. Among the firms that triggered its rules, Thames Water had seven of the most serious category of pollution incidents, recorded in 2024. It also breached its licence to hold a sufficient credit rating and had a one-star rating in relation to its environmental performance. This meant that no bonuses or other awards were paid to its chief executive or its former finance chief, who left in March. Wessex Water triggered Ofwat's rule due to a criminal conviction for a sewage leak in 2024 which The company said it therefore decided not to pay any executive bonuses. Ofwat wrote in its report: ""While there has been some progress in certain areas on accountability, water companies must better demonstrate that they understand the feeling of public anger on bonuses and the expectation that they are accountable, and reflect this better in their decisions on executive remuneration.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c781v25e8xqo

RSPB Otmoor, in Oxfordshire, will be extended with the addition of a new 21-hectare site, which had previously been agricultural land. Cherwell District Council said work had already begun on the site to transform it into a floodplain grazing marsh - with features known as scrapes and footdrains being installed. The new space will become the district's second habitat bank - which are areas of land set aside and managed to help with nature recovery. It will be managed by the RSPB, with wading bird species including lapwing, redshank, curlew and snipe among those being targeted. Councillor Jean Conway, planning and development chief, said: ""Otmoor is a real treasure when it comes to wetland habitats and sustaining populations of some of the UK's most beautiful wader species."" ""With their unrivalled knowledge and years of experience at Otmoor, the RSPB are the perfect partner to help us bring forward this new habitat bank.""

2025-11-06,Scottish government reveals plan to reach net zero targets by 2045,science,BBC,"The Scottish government has announced its strategy to move towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. A draft climate action plan includes targets to decarbonise building heat systems, phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, increase woodland planting and accelerate peatland restoration. Climate Action Secretary Gillian Martin told MSPs that Scotland was already being affected by flooding, heatwaves and wildfires, and that parliament had to act. Opposition MSPs, however, accused ministers of regurgitating old ideas and providing a lack of detail. The draft plan, which will face further scrutiny from parliament, sets out the government's strategy until 2040 - five years before Holyrood ministers say they will effectively eliminate greenhouse gases. The strategy recommits Scotland to phasing out new diesel and petrol cars by 2030, and  sets the target of ""decarbonising"" heating in buildings by 2045, which would include a switch away from gas boilers or systems using oil. Non-domestic buildings will be required to connect to low-carbon district heating systems, which are to be extended. The plan proposes increasing Scotland's woodlands, so that by 2029-30 18,000 hectares are planted a year. The strategy also includes consumer incentives to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles. The government proposes more investment in peatland restoration to offset that livestock numbers will not have to be cut. That is to be combined with faster decarbonisation in fuel supply. The Climate Change Committee had advised that cattle numbers would need to be cut to achieve reductions in agriculture, which is the third biggest source of planet-warming emissions. The combined climate policies will cost £4.8bn between 2026 to 2040, but bring benefits of £42.3bn, according to the government. Martin, who announced the strategy in parliament, pointed to ""massive untapped potential"" in renewable energy, but also said there was a particular responsibility to support oil and gas workers with a ""just transition"". Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Douglas Lumsden said that the plan ""rehashes existing SNP policies which do nothing to bring down energy bills and provide no clarity on how they intend to reach the 2045 target"". He said it failed to address concerns about moves to replace household boilers with heat pumps, trading in petrol vehicles for electric alternatives and a presumption against new oil and gas exploration. Labour's Sarah Boyack said more detailed plans were needed on how to retrofit homes to improve energy efficiency and warned there was a lack of support for local authorities to create jobs in green industries and invest in homes. Green MSP Patrick Harvie said Scotland was ""years behind where it should be on climate"". He accused ministers of slowing down environmental action and rejecting the ""clear advice"" of the Climate Change Committee on agriculture. ""They give no clarity at all on fossil fuel extraction and they've filleted the heat and buildings bill, now proposing a target with no delivery mechanism,"" Harvie added. Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie welcomed some aspects of the plan but added that there was little new information in the draft proposals. The Scottish government has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045 - five years earlier than the UK government's target date of 2050. But after repeatedly missing annual and interim targets, SNP ministers in favour of five-yearly carbon budgets. The government is aiming to cut emissions by an average of 57% over the next five years and by 69% by 2035, when compared with 1990 levels. By 2040, ministers hope to increase that figure to 80%. , from 2023, shows that planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland were down by more than 50% against the 1990 baseline year. The publication of the draft climate change plan has been delayed since November 2023, when ministers said they had to postpone the release due to a change in the UK government's net zero commitments. The Scottish government said it was committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels to greener sources of energy, though First Minister North Sea oil and gas would be needed ""for a period of time"". The licensing of offshore oil and gas fields for exploration or extraction is reserved to the UK government. Labour ministers have committed to banning new exploration licences, though this would not rule out developing existing fields. The draft plan is out for consultation until 29 January. Responses will be considered before the final plan is rubber-stamped. Think tank IPPR Scotland said that the government had made a ""positive case"" for climate action but that ""key questions appear to remain unanswered"". Friends of the Earth Scotland head of campaigns Caroline Rance said the ""dreadful plan"" would ""barely scratch the surface"" of what was required. She added: ""There is nothing here to help people who are struggling to pay their energy bills, communities cut off by unreliable buses, or oil workers worried about their future."" The devil is in the detail. And there is a lot of it in the draft climate plan. Hundreds of pages, in fact. But what jumps out is what ministers clearly state are their alternatives to cutting livestock numbers. Agriculture is the third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions and yet the first minister promised that herd sizes would stay the same. Firstly, restoring more of Scotland's peatlands which - in poor condition, as most are - are notoriously leaky on the carbon front. By 2032, it is promised that one fifth of those peatlands - 400,000 hectares - will be restored although working out a way to do that without pumping endless amounts of public money at it has long proved tricky. That pledge is coupled with a commitment towards ""higher fuel supply decarbonisation"" which essentially means importing fewer fossil fuels and increasing our capacity of wind and solar energy. That is happening anyway and depends largely on whether we are able to wean ourselves off oil and gas by reducing demand.

2025-11-07,Wildlife Trust claims victory in dredging battle,science,BBC,"The Sussex Wildlife Trust is celebrating victory in a legal battle over planned dredging off the coast of the county. by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) to allow Brighton Marina to dispose of material in the Beachy Head West Marine Conservation Zone. On Tuesday the Trust heard its challenge in the High Court had been successful. The MMO said it did not defend the challenge as it had not assessed ""whether the application had avoided, minimised or mitigated adverse impacts."" The dredging is needed to keep the entrance to Brighton Marina navigable, but Henri Brocklebank, the trust's director of conservation, said it would have meant one million tonnes of sediment being dumped over 10 years. She said: ""It's 33,000 shipping containers worth of spoil - if that was on the South Downs everyone would lose it, but it's at sea. ""It's a really special, important, internationally rare habitat."" A decision on where the spoil will now be dumped has yet to be made. ""The marina is still going to need to be clear for boat users"" said Ms Brocklebank, ""so we anticipate they will move at a reasonable pace but following a suitable process."" An MMO spokesperson said: ""We notified the judge of our intention not to defend the judicial review on our decision to grant a marine licence for Brighton Marina Dredge and Disposal. ""This decision was based on one of the points raised by Sussex Wildlife Trust.

2025-11-07,NHS Wales carbon emissions up by 20% since 2019,science,BBC,"Total carbon emissions from NHS Wales have risen by 20% since 2018-19, despite targets to reduce them by 16%. NHS Wales has blamed the increased rise in emissions on its suppliers, and vowed to work with outside firms ""to minimise environmental impact"". Over the same period, emissions outside the NHS supply chain - in areas such as buildings and transport - decreased by nearly a quarter, which the NHS has hailed as ""significant progress"". The NHS has a duty, under Welsh government criteria, to reach net zero by 2050, but a report by the Climate Change Committee in 2023 found Wales was on actions needed to fight climate change. NHS Wales said it was revitalising its decarbonisation plan in order to set out a ""clear roadmap"" to reach the stated target. One significant initiative has seen the intensive care unit (ICU) at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff cut plastic waste by two tonnes every year over the past five years. Dr Jack Parry-Jones, a consultant in adult intensive care medicine, said: ""We are focusing on actions, not policy"". ""The actions we want are to reduce waste, to reduce energy consumption."" As part of sustainable practices introduced since 2019, the Green ICU Team, at Cardiff and Vale health board, has reduced the number of non-sterile plastic gloves in critical care by nearly half a million a year. Additionally, patients' plastic water bottles are recycled, tap water is used in place of sterile water, and energy saving measures such as installing LED lighting and switching machines off when they are fully charged have been introduced - with the  health board stating it had saved thousands of pounds. Yet, despite the ICU's efforts, overall emissions by NHS Wales have risen by a fifth since 2018-19. Supply chain emissions rose by 44% over the given period, while non-supply chain emissions dropped by 23%. Total emissions for 2024 include 77% emissions linked to the NHS supply chain, 15% associated with its buildings, and 6% from transport, with waste and medical gases accounting for the remainder. Sustainability consultant Mari Arthur said the NHS has a ""huge amount of purchasing power"" and should be able to demand lower emissions from its suppliers. Single-use items, such as plastic aprons, can have a large carbon footprint, she said. ""That apron might have been manufactured in Asia, for example, where most single-use PPE is manufactured. ""You've got the embedded carbon of fossil fuels in the manufacturing process, [and] the transportation of bringing something across the world - so, maybe, months' worth of carbon being built up for that one item to be used for a few minutes - sometimes a few seconds - and then discarded, and then burnt, or gone to landfill."" As part of its new decarbonisation plan, NHS Wales vowed to ""work with suppliers to minimise environmental impact"". It will also look to improve energy efficiency and the use of renewables, support more sustainable travel, and work to reduce waste. Cabinet secretary for Health and Social Care Jeremy Miles said: ""We all have a part to play in addressing the climate emergency. ""The NHS in Wales can play its part by taking simple steps, such as reducing waste, saving energy and working as sustainably as possible, while focusing on delivering high-quality care.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x17e0ld9xo
2025-11-07,James Watson: Controversial discoverer of 'the secret of life',science,BBC,"In February 1953, two men walked into a pub in Cambridge and announced they had found ""the secret of life"".  It was not an idle boast. One was James Watson, an American biologist from the Cavendish laboratory; the other was his British research partner, Francis Crick. Their discovery - of the structure and function of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA - ranks alongside those of Mendel and Darwin in its significance to modern science. The full Promethean power of their achievement would slowly emerge over decades of research by fellow geneticists. It also opened a Pandora's Box of controversial scientific and ethical issues - including human cloning, designer babies and ""Frankenstein foods"". Demonstrating that DNA has a three-dimensional, double-helix shape allowed Watson and Crick to unlock the secrets of how cells worked; the means by which characteristics were passed down through generations. ""When we saw the answer we had to pinch ourselves,"" said Watson. ""We realised it probably was true because it was so pretty."" The discovery won them a Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1962 and a permanent place in the historic ranks of great scientific thinkers. It also guaranteed that, if they said something controversial, it made headline news. - had plenty to say, most notoriously speculating about a link between race and intelligence. When he first suggested that black people are less intelligent, London's Science Museum cancelled a planned lecture - insisting Watson's views went ""beyond the point of acceptable debate"". He suggested ""when you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them"".  And he wondered aloud if beauty not only could - but should - be genetically encouraged. Watson was heavily criticised for saying that women should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests proved it would be homosexual. He argued he was simply in favour of choice, that it would be equally permissible to favour homosexual offspring and that it was simply natural to want grandchildren. He alienated many in his own profession, calling many fellow academics ""dinosaurs"", ""deadbeats"", ""fossils"" and ""has-beens"" in his autobiography, Avoid Boring People. In 2014, he became the first living recipient of the Nobel Prize to auction off his medal - in part to help fund future scientific discovery. A Russian tycoon bought it for $4.8m (£3m) and promptly gave it back to him. James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928 to a family who believed in ""books, birds and the Democratic Party"". He was the only son of Jean and James, who were descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers. His political interest came from his mother who worked for the Democrats. The basement of their bungalow would be pressed into service as a polling station at election time. His father's passions were science and bird-watching. Young Watson would accompany his father on birding trips. He learned that science was a discipline demanding careful observation from nature. This left no place for faith.  Brought up a Catholic by his mother, Watson described himself as an ""escapee from that religion"". ""The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father did not believe in God,"" he said. The Great Depression of the 1930s saw his father's salary suddenly cut in half and a dash to the bank to get their remaining savings out in time. Watson slept in a tiny attic room shared with his younger sister, Betty. He was a skinny teenager told to go to buy milkshakes to ""fatten him up"". He was socially awkward and expelled from school for poor grades - his work badly affected by a bout of scarlet fever. ""None of my classmates thought I would amount to much,"" he recalled. He did not think of himself as a precocious intellect but he took up a scholarship at the University of Chicago at the tender age of 15. He put it down to ""my mother knowing the dean of admissions"". University freed him from complicated social hierarchies of school life where popularity and physical stature were critical. It provided the environment where a brilliant but awkward teenager could thrive. Watson thought of majoring in ornithology, the study of birds, but changed to genetics - influenced by Erwin Schrodinger's book What is Life? He described the University of Chicago as an ""idyllic academic institution"" where he was ""instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth"". The prevailing scientific wisdom was that genes were proteins able to replicate themselves. The presence of DNA was dismissed as something ""stupid"" simply there to support the protein. Watson became fascinated by the new technique of diffraction whereby X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures. He became convinced that DNA had a structure of its own and was determined to find it. He thought the place to do that was England. At Cambridge, he met Francis Crick, a physicist by training with ""extraordinary conversational ability"" and ""the loudest laugh I have ever known"". They began constructing large-scale models of possible structures for DNA and trying to fit them to the available evidence. In one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time, not all of this evidence was their own. Watson and Crick were in a race with another team at King's College London. Their rivals were Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. They got on well with him and appallingly badly with her. Wilkins corresponded with the Cambridge pair, sometimes exchanging his thoughts and insights. But Franklin was different. She was the most experienced chemist and an expert in diffraction. She, alongside her student Raymond Gosling, would take photographs of the patterns made by X-rays as they bounced off DNA molecules. Watson and Crick found Franklin ""hostile"" and thought she jealously guarded her research and worked in isolation. They were dismissive and sniped about her appearance, but Watson wasn't above taking a look at her work when Wilkins offered. It shows a fuzzy pattern of X-rays that fascinated the Cambridge pair. They threw themselves into a frenzy of model building, testing each theory against the new information. From this, they deduced that DNA must have a three-dimensional, double-helix structure - like a twisted ladder with rungs formed of alternating salt and phosphate groups. Their key conclusions were that, if separated, each strand provided a template for creating the other and that the order of the ""rungs"" was a code. If you can understand that code, they reasoned, you can unpick the wonders of life. Wilkins wrote to his rivals to congratulate them on winning what had, at times, been a bitter race. When he was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Medicine - alongside Watson and Crick - Franklin did not accompany them. Her life was cut short by ovarian cancer at just 37. According to the rules of the Nobel committee, only the living could be honoured. Her fans felt Franklin had been cheated twice. Later Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard. He became professor of biology and had two sons - one of whom suffered from schizophrenia. Then he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an ailing institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes. In 1968, his account of the race to discover the structure of DNA, The Double Helix, was published. It is a painful examination of the story. It rakes over the personalities, controversies and bitterness from his point of view. He considered calling the book Honest Jim. But for all Professor Watson's academic achievements, his later career was overshadowed by his controversial public statements. In 1990, the journal Science wrote that ""to many in the scientific community, Watson has long been something of a wild man, and his colleagues tend to hold their collective breath whenever he veers from the script"". At a conference in 2000, Watson proved it right. He floated the idea that black people might have larger libidos than whites. His lecture argued that melanin, which gives skin its colour, boosted the sex drive. ""That's why you have Latin lovers,"" he told the delegates. ""You never have an English lover, only an English patient."" He suggested that humanity might screen out the stupid people by genetic testing. Then he gave an interview that put the biggest dent in his reputation. While promoting his autobiography, Watson spoke to the Sunday Times. The piece quoted him as ""gloomy about the prospect of Africa"" because ""our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really"". Watson went on to admit this ""hot potato"" was difficult to address and his hope was that everyone was equal. However, he said, ""People who have to deal with black employees find this not true"". He later apologised but his research institute stripped him of executive power and kicked him upstairs as chancellor emeritus. James Watson spent the rest of his life continuing to raise money for medical research, often shamelessly reaching for the heart strings. ""Nothing attracts money like a quest for the cure to a terrible disease,"" he said. He never stopped causing waves, warning that ""Viagra is fighting evolution"". Men, he also argued, should store sperm in their teens to avoid an increased possibility of fathering children with developmental difficulties. He repeated his views on the link between race and intelligence in a 2019 documentary, after which the scientific community revoked his remaining honorary positions. He will be remembered as the ""Godfather of DNA"", the man who unravelled the secrets of life, and a world-class controversialist who often put his foot in his mouth.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr70zznpjxo

A former government expert in avian virology has warned the current bird flu virus infecting farm flocks across the UK , while Ms Dryden said if her flock was infected it could be the end of her family's business. ""We've been doing it for 25 years and that would be tragic,"" she said. The mandatory housing order means anyone who has more than 50 birds must keep them inside to lower the risk of bird flu spreading. All bird keepers have also been told they must cleanse and disinfect clothing and remain alert to any signs of the disease. But farmers say there is no guarantee of staying safe, even if people follow the strict biosecurity measures. Richard Dryden said it could take as little as a ""bit of excrement on a boot"" to spread the virus. ""Feathers or a skin cell from a passing bird can be enough to bring on the disease,"" he said. The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss has urged all bird keepers to comply with the new housing measures and remain alert to any signs of the disease.

2025-11-09,Back from the brink: UK red kites aid Spanish cousins,science,BBC,"A British red kite emerges from an aviary in the remote hills of western Spain and takes flight. At six months old, this is its first taste of freedom. Without a sound, it soars high in the sky above scrubland and within seconds disappears from view into a wooded valley in the distance. It is the latest release in a conservation story that has come full circle. Nearly four decades ago, the birds were extinct in England and Scotland with just a few pairs left in Wales. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, red kite chicks from Spain and Sweden were released in the Chilterns on the Oxfordshire-Buckinghamshire border. It proved so successful that the species is now thriving across the UK, with estimates of more than 6,000 mating pairs or about 15% of the world's population. Dr Ian Evans, from Natural England, was one of the early pioneers. He said: ""There were a lot of unknowns. The first lot we released, we thought they might just die or they might just move away. ""In 1991, we had our first breeding pairs and that was really an eye-opener because we thought 'well, this can be successful'. ""That was the springboard for establishing other release sites in England and Scotland."" British-born red kite chicks have now been taken to south west Spain as part of a four-year project to revive the population there from the brink of extinction. The region has fewer than 50 mating pairs due to predators like the eagle owl and human factors such as illegal poisoning and electrocution. to collect red kite chicks, mostly from Northamptonshire, and send them over to the Extremadura region of Spain. More than 120 chicks have been collected, with about 30 exported each year. The chicks are flown to Madrid and then transported 240 miles (385km) south to a wildlife hospital in Villafranca de los Barros, run by Accion por el Mundo Salvaje ( When I arrive, the small team, led by ornithologist and project manager Alfonso Godino, are hard at work. Each chick has to be weighed, measured and tagged before being fitted with a GPS backpack which allows experts to track them. The birds look lifeless as they are manoeuvred into position. Mr Godino tells me they play dead when they feel under threat. Asked whether the tagging is painful, he says it is a minor discomfort, like having your ears pierced. Alfonso says the juveniles soon get used to the large tags, which are needed so they can be observed from the ground. The birds are then moved to holding aviaries near the Portuguese border for two weeks to acclimatise to their new surroundings. The release site is quiet and remote. There is a strong stench of rotting flesh coming from a sheep's carcass that has been left to entice red kites to feed here. As the gate is removed, I half expect the chicks to rush out but, but apart from a few flutters inside the aviary, nothing happens. It takes several hours, as though they are building up courage, before one by one they leave the safety of the aviary behind and fly off into the wild. ""Now is the exciting moment when they are in the wild, they can learn to search for food, to avoid predators, to interact with other species in the area... thanks to the GPS we are going to closely monitor these birds we have released,"" Alfonso tells me. But this is a nerve-racking time for AMUS field technician Sofia Marrero. ""The mortality for raptors in general is really high during the first years of their life,"" she says. ""So now it's a little bit hard because you already know that some of them may not get to sexual maturity, so it's a bittersweet moment."" In fact, only about a quarter of the red kites released during the project have survived. The biggest threat is from predators and natural causes. In 2023, eagle owls were responsible for killing half of the project's newly released red kite chicks. In response, the team at AMUS adapted how and when the chicks are released to increase their chances of survival. A lot of work has also been done to adapt thousands of kilometres of power cables to reduce the risk of electrocution. But the biggest human risk to birds of prey is from illegal poisoning. Between 2020-2024, 3,060 red kites were tagged and fitted with GPS as part of the , spanning 40 project areas in 12 countries. By September 2024, 1,377 tagged red kites had died - 622 from natural causes, including predation, while 195 died from poisoning and 54 from illegal shooting. Experts say the figures represent just the ""tip of the iceberg"" in terms of illegal persecution. In the UK, the RSPB is working with European partners to provide advice on how to investigate cases of poisoning. A report by the charity last year revealed at least 1,344 birds of prey had been killed in the UK between 2009 and 2023. ""Raptor persecution is directly linked to game estates so in the lowlands pheasant and partridge and in the uplands grouse,"" Mark Thomas, head of investigations at RSPB says. ""All the statistics prove that... two thirds of all the convictions are for gamekeepers so these are people employed lawfully to control vermin they can control but on some estates some of these gamekeepers kill things that are fully protected,"" he adds. The charity believes licensing game estates would tackle the issue but that is disputed by the Countryside Alliance. In a statement, the non-profit organisation said: ""Any incident of raptor persecution is utterly condemnable, with the penalties already including a prison sentence along with an unlimited fine."" In Spain, the relocation project in Extremadura has seen three mating pairs so far that have produced two surviving chicks. With more tagged red kites due to reach sexual maturity next year, it is hoped these numbers will multiply. ""There are still huge areas of southern Spain where the red kite was common three decades ago and is now almost extinct,"" Mr Godino says. ""So the next step is how we can apply this experience to other areas of Spain.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrez8x7l55o

Heads of state, diplomats, activists, and delegations from 200 countries will attend the event in Belém, in the Amazon rainforest. The annual United Nations meeting takes place 10 years after the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. Benika Lal, a geography student at the university, said: ""The focus [at COP30] is on youth voices and how we can contribute to our own future. At previous COPs young people haven't always been included."" Joining Ms Lal is fourth-year medical student Hadil Touihri. ""Climate change is already having a massive impact on medical services,"" she said. ""It's already having an impact on the NHS, so it's a chance to share my experience."" The trip will be a return to Brazil for the two students. In the summer they spent time in the Amazonian rainforest as part of the university's Brazil Institute's Immerse Amazonia project. Eight students met with Brazilian students and academics and explored both the rainforests and also the issues around climate change. ""You study the Amazon, and then you end up there,"" said Ms Lal.

2025-11-10,Researchers track climate change in Arctic Circle,science,BBC,"Equipment to help monitor climate change has been set up in the Arctic Circle by researchers from the University of Leicester. The team from the National Centre for Earth Observation travelled to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard to install thermal radiometers which will collect ""precise, on-the-spot"" temperature data. The data is used to validate measurements taken by orbiting satellites and helps scientists understand how the region is being affected by climate change. Research associate Abigail Waring said the station was one of the first of its kind in the arctic. ""My first thought flying over the fjords and seeing the ice shelves, I genuinely welled up because it was just so stunning,"" she said. ""It really put into perspective that even though I sit behind a desk and look at data and we see these trends, it is really happening and it is really affecting people."" Climate scientists say the Arctic is warming , so accurately tracking temperature changes is essential. Dr Jasdeep Singh Anand said taking continuous measurements was ""very challenging"". ""We're talking about a region that is 5.5 million square miles and a mixture of open ocean, sea ice, tundra, so satellites offer our best method of viewing this area over a very very long timescale,"" he said. ""However, because we're measuring the temperature indirectly from space, we need assurance that these measurements are correct."" The team learned how one of the glaciers they hiked up - the Kongsbreen glacier - had receded by 2,625 ft (800m) in six weeks and has not recovered. They also observed how summer sea ice disappears earlier in the year. Sea ice acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space, but as rising temperatures cause it to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further. Ms Waring also said the trip was not without its dangers, as polar bears ""roam freely"". ""You have a polar bear designated safe zone but you're not allowed to go out of it unless you're with someone who's trained with a rifle,"" she said. ""They can walk onto the research centre and they have alerts for that, but it is quite scary to think you could just see a polar bear across the fjord.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5165dpzwlo

Both seals, who were underweight and dehydrated, are being cared for at the New Era Vets while a plan is made for their future, BDMLR said. The charity said to have a chance to survive alone, the seals would need to weigh at least 30kg (66.1lb). ""Neither would survive back out in the wild at the size they were,"" it said. The female pup was also covered in small wounds and flies when she was found, the charity added. BDMLR said St Catherine RNLI helped with the rescue the female pup and thanked members of the public who alerted them to the seals.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740dzvgn55o
2025-11-10,Missing flamingo thought to be living in France,science,BBC,"A flamingo that went missing from a wildlife sanctuary in Cornwall over a week ago appears to now be living in northern France. Two photographs show a young flamingo on a beach in Treflez, Finistere, on Sunday morning. Frankie escaped from a walled garden at the park on Sunday 2 November, despite having clipped feathers. Paradise Park director Nick Reynolds said there was a colony of greater flamingos in southern France and ""the best scenario would be that Frankie goes and finds them and lives out her life with them"". Mr Reynolds said: ""We're pretty certain it is Frankie from the photos we've seen. ""You can see the right wing has some feathers missing, which is where we would have cut her wings to keep her here. ""We're just waiting for some more pictures to come through for better confirmation."" Mr Reynolds added it had been a ""really difficult"" week since the flamingo went missing but seeing the new photographs had been ""lovely"". ""She looks fit and well, which is brilliant,"" Mr Reynolds said. He said it was well within a flamingo's capabilities to fly that distance, albeit ""not a small feat"". He said the paperwork and complexities of bird flu regulations would make it challenging to rehome Frankie in the UK and he hoped that she found a flamingo colony in southern France. Frankie was born in July and was the first chick to hatch from her nest and be reared by her parents at the park. Mr Reynolds asked anyone who saw her to send photographs and locations to the team via the Paradise Park Facebook account. ""She's still our baby and we want to know what's happening with her,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0rr0yk11o
2025-11-11,'Sea Life penguins must get the life they deserve',science,BBC,"Penguins ""trapped"" in the Sea Life London Aquarium must ""get the life they deserve"", a group of MPs has warned. The captivity of 15 Gentoo penguins at the riverside attraction is ""un-British"", said David Taylor, Labour MP for Hemel Hempstead, who is leading the campaign. The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, opened its first penguin exhibit in May 2011 with 10 Gentoo penguins from Edinburgh Zoo. A spokesperson from the Merlin Entertainments' conservation, welfare and education team said the enclosure replicated the penguin's natural habitat, and was on the ground floor of the aquarium rather than the basement. In a letter to Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Emma Reynolds, the group of MPs asked her to ""consider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioural, ecological and physiological needs"". Mr Taylor said: ""It's un-British to keep penguins trapped in a basement with no daylight or fresh air. ""No animal should live like that, with their rights appearing to be traded for hard cash. ""Labour has always stood up for animals and we won't stop until these penguins get the life they deserve."" The campaign has received the backing of former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey, who challenged the new Merlin Entertainments chief executive Fiona Eastwood to "" A petition by campaign group Freedom For Animals calling for the penguins to be moved into a better facility has received more than 37,000 signatures. The Merlin Entertainments spokesperson said: ""We know that many people care deeply about the Gentoo penguins at Sea Life London Aquarium - we do too. ""We have an incredible team of conservationists, animal welfare specialists, and aquarists who are with the penguins every day, making sure they're healthy and thriving."" They said Penguin Point met the and was ""carefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins' natural environment"".

2025-11-11,Scottish scientists tackle vampire bat rabies threat in Amazon,science,BBC,"Scottish scientists in the Amazon are helping to tackle a growing threat from vampire bats, which carry the deadly rabies virus. Researchers say more humans and livestock are being bitten by the bats because of the impacts of climate change - due to rising temperatures and changing land use. A team led by the University of Glasgow is developing vaccines and monitoring the expansion of bat roosts in Peru, Columbia and Brazil. Rabies kills tens of thousands annually with 40% of those deaths in under-15s, according to the World Health Organisation. It is regarded globally as the most lethal of the infectious diseases and left untreated leads to almost-certain death in people who are unvaccinated. Almost all human cases are caused by dogs, but vampire bats are huge carriers in Amazonian countries such as Peru, Columbia and Brazil - where Prof Daniel Streicker, from Glasgow University's Centre for Virus Research, said an increasing number of areas were becoming affected by rabies. He said: ""This is a virus transmitted by blood-feeding bats. The bats need to eat blood every two to three days to survive. ""People are getting bitten by bats routinely and for many, many years nothing can happen and then suddenly deaths begin."" He adds that there are hundreds of thousands of bats biting animals and humans in the Amazon every night. A prime reason for the spread is believed to be climate change, with evidence that vampire bats in parts of Mexico are moving into new areas further north. The teams have witnessed an increasing spread of rabies across the landscape which is advancing at a rate of between 10km (6 miles) and 20km (12 miles) every year. They are aiming to improve understanding of the reasons for the spread to anticipate where communities are most vulnerable. Since 2007, researchers have been taking blood and faeces samples from vampire bats at dozens of locations to check for signs of the virus. Theses include monitoring rabies in bat caves in Peru, where nets are installed on cave entrances to capture the bats. The samples are flown back to Glasgow for lab testing. The results helps them track the spread so communities can be warned to take preventative action through vaccination of themselves and their livestock. Experts say pressures on indigenous populations living in the rain forest are also behind the growth in vampire bat bites. The introduction of livestock into some regions is providing new feeding opportunities for the mammals. Human attempts to catch and kill bats in areas where rabies is present is also understood to be driving infected animals into new areas. In the long run, the teams are hoping to develop vaccination programmes that can be administered into the bat populations. One way of doing this involves administering the vaccine onto the animals as a paste and relying on transmission through other bats licking the fur. The process has been tested in lab conditions with field trials expected to begin soon. But the process is self-limiting, meaning only those immediately surrounding the treated bat would ingest the vaccine. Scientists are also working on a transmissible vaccine which can spread throughout the population without having to rely solely on the original treated animal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74015ll09yo
2025-11-10,Swans and fish die amid pollution incident,science,BBC,"A pollution incident has killed several thousand fish in Kent, the Environment Agency (EA) has said. About 3.7 miles (6km) of a stream known as Sarre Penn and the adjacent River Wantsum, near Canterbury, have been affected, it said. The agency said specialist officers were at the scene and it was working to establish the source of the pollution. Meanwhile, Johnny Allen, a volunteer at Kent Wildlife Rescue, told the BBC he had also recovered three dead swans from the area. The EA said it was investigating whether wildlife other than fish had been affected by the pollution incident. Several cases of ""highly pathogenic"" bird flu have also been confirmed by the Animal and Plant Health Agency in wild birds across Kent in recent weeks, including in swans. , with transmission from birds rare. Mr Allen said the source of the pollution was unclear as the water had no odour or colour. ""Has someone dumped something? The river runs under a road. Has something discharged from a vehicle and its got into the water system? I don't know,"" he added. He said the dead fish were bottom feeders like carp and tench, indicating the pollution may have been on the riverbed. ""Something's not quite right,"" he continued. Mr Allen said Kent Wildlife Rescue was working to find and log dead animals with the authorities, though he said their capacity was limited as they needed more volunteers. In the meantime, he was concerned about people, especially young children, becoming ""distressed"" if they saw dead or dying swans, and keen that dog walkers and people that went fishing were alerted. The Environment Agency said conditions in the stream were ""improving"" and that it had taken samples. It urged anyone with information about the incident or suspected pollution to get in touch.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7v17nyz4o
2025-11-11,Six dead after second typhoon in a week hits the Philippines,science,BBC,"At least six people have died after a super typhoon barrelled through the Philippines, mere days after an earlier storm left more than 200 people dead. brought floods and landslides, which caused most of the deaths. It also cut power across entire provinces. It later weakened into a typhoon. More than 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of it making landfall in the Philippines. It is now heading for Taiwan, where more than 3,000 people have been evacuated. Fung-wong was the 21st typhoon to hit the South East Asian nation this year, at a time where many residents are still struggling to recover from back-to-back natural disasters. Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, slammed into Aurora province on Luzon Sunday night with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h. The Philippines' meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and ""high-risk of life-threatening"" storm surges from the ""very intense"" typhoon. In Cabanatuan, one of the worst-hit cities, the BBC saw residents rushing into their homes to pull out furniture and pets on Monday, desperate to salvage as many of their possessions possible as water levels rose. Although its wind speeds did not come up to par with some of the strongest storms in the Philippines' history, Fung-wong dumped large amounts of rain on the country, leaving some 4,100 houses either totally destroyed or partially damaged. Cabanatuan resident Mercidita Adriano and her family had trimmed trees near their home last week to prepare for the storm. When the winds and rain intensified, ten of them crowded into a small room, praying throughout the day that the typhoon would spare their house, she told the BBC. Part of their roof was torn off by the heavy rain. Large parts of the country are still under water although the levels have gone down as of Tuesday morning. ripped through the same region, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling.

2025-11-11,Tutankhamun: How Englishmen uncovered the boy-king,science,BBC,"To mark the hundred-year anniversary, a new database containing thousands of personal records and documents from the time has been opened at the University of Oxford - making them fully accessible for the first time. The tomb of the former boy-king was discovered in 1922 by English archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron Lord Carnarvon from Hampshire. And between 11 and 19 November 1925, the pharaoh's body was meticulously unwrapped in a heavily symbolic and well documented process. It was on 26 November 1922 that Howard Carter held up a candle to peer through a tiny breach chiselled in a doorway sealed for three millennia. His partner and financial backer, Lord Carnarvon, waited anxiously nearby. The tale of the pair's incredible archaeological discovery, after years of digging in Luxor with little to show for it, enthralled the world. Lord Carnarvon has often been portrayed as merely Carter's patron but ""without him we probably would not have found the tomb of Tutankhamun"", the current Lady Carnarvon explained. She owns and runs the family's ancestral seat at Highclere Castle, in Hampshire, alongside her husband, Lord Carnarvon's great-grandson the eighth Earl of Carnarvon. ""He's often misrepresented today,"" she said of Lord Carnarvon. ""People say he's just a one dimensional financier - far from it."" ""He was a great traveller, a restless man, and he was always trying to find something else, which I think is innate in all of us,"" she explained. ""He spent the winter months out in Egypt, he became very adept - he wasn't a trained Egyptologist, but nor was Howard Carter."" ""It was two unlikely Englishmen in some ways, but their resilience, passion, obsession, and obviously his money, led to the discovery of Tutankhamun."" Along with photographer Harry Burton, Carter and Lord Carnarvon meticulously documented the tomb's more than 5,000 objects. The collection, which includes thousands of photographs, drawings and notebook pages, was donated to the Griffith Institute, the centre for Egyptology at the University of Oxford, after Carter's death in 1939. ""These records show how the tomb looked like when it was discovered, so this shows you how Howard Carter and his team saw the tomb,"" Daniela Rosenow, manager of the Griffith Institute and Egyptologist, said. Now, for the first time, the records will be available to researchers and the general public on an easy accessible database created by the institute. ""We really hope this will nurture research on the objects, which is desperately needed,"" Ms Rosenow said. ""The tomb of Tutankhamun is still not that well published or studied, because it is not easy to access the actual objects."" ""My hope is that much more will come out now everyone can search the records and do the research."" Lady Carnarvon, who has written a book on the subject, said the documents show the discovery had been the ""result of hard work... and of a really well planned concessions"". ""There was a plan, there was a strategy, but actually in some ways they found it against all the odds."" And on that November day more than a century ago, Carter, Carnarvon and his daughter, Lady Evelyn, first climbed in to the perfectly intact tomb of the boy-king. Lady Carnarvon said her great-grandfather-in-law had tried to write about first seeing the chamber, but just said it was ""entirely surreal"". ""It was beyond anything they'd ever dreamt of,"" she said. The world's media went into frenzy over the discovery, with Carter and Carnarvon becoming world famous. Lady Carnarvon said she believes the interest in Tutankhamun comes from the ""totality of the treasures"". ""It is a window back in time, of a culture which spanned 5,000 years and created works of art and architecture, such as we probably haven't created in our own world after 2,000 years."" Just months after the discovery, Lord Carnarvon died following a mosquito bite - with some in the media speculating that it was the result of a curse placed on the tomb of Tutankhamun. ""He sacrificed all that we can give,"" Lady Carnarvon said. ""You can read into it what you will."" ""I think there's a lot we don't understand in this world and the next, however you choose to interpret our imagination and our consciousness,"" she added. A beta version of the Oxford database has launched, exactly a hundred years on from the unwrapping of Tutankhamun's mummy, and will showcase Carter's material from the de-mummifying process. ""We do have other royal mummies, but none before were found in their context, their tombs had all already been plundered in antiquity - this is the first and only time that a royal mummy had been discovered in situ,"" Ms Rosenow explained of the event's significance. ""This was all planned in a very scientific way, a committee of experts was gathered and it took them nine days to unwrap the body."" She added: ""During these nine days, some of the most stunning archaeological records ever were produced."" The databases launch comes just weeks after in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. Described as the world's largest archaeological museum, it is packed with some 100,000 artefacts - including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb. ""You can now see all these objects carefully curated as individual masterpieces,"" Ms Rosenow said. ""But not everyone can travel to Egypt, and our database will give everyone around the world the sense of how the tomb originally looked."" Once the database is completed, and the 5000 or so objects are inputted, Ms Rosenow said the next step was to create an interactive 3D digital model of the tomb as it was found. But in Dorchester, that is already a reality. The Tutankhamun Exhibition in the town gives visitors the chance to experience an exact replica of the tomb. Michael Ridley, the exhibition's director, said the showcase's journey from its original home at the British Museum had been an ""accident of history"". Struggles to find a suitable permanent home for the display eventually ended with the choice of a redundant church in Dorset's county town. It has remained there ever since, with more than two million people having visited it in that time. Mr Ridley said visitors came through the doors because Tutankhamun's story was ""in fact many stories"". ""It is about the discovery of treasure, it's because of the wonderful gold mask that covered the head of Tut's mummy, and because of the mystery of why and how this pharaoh died at the young age of 19,"" he said. Of the new database, Mr Ridley said its appeal was that ""documents are the raw material of history"". ""They combine with the evidence unearthed by archaeology to make sense of the past."" More than a century on from the discovery, the story of Tutankhamun and his uncovering after millennia still captivates and intrigues the world. ""I think it's like all the appeal of Rider Haggard, Indiana Jones and the missions that we set ourselves in life,"" Lady Carnarvon suggested on why interest remains. ""All of us are the same, and I think the ultimate desire we all have, a quest we all have, is for knowledge, or for treasure - and maybe knowledge is treasure."" But Ms Rosenow suggested a different answer for the persisting interest. ""There's this mystery about this young man who died very unexpectedly, but also it's the amazing and beautiful objects,"" she said. ""They are visually striking and you learn so much about ancient Egypt, but also about this young person, Tutankhamun."" ""Hopefully, a 100 years on, you can actually move away from the gold and the curse and look at the young man.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyld28d0x3o
2025-11-10,Southern Water sorry after pellets pollute beach,science,BBC,"Southern Water has said it is ""highly likely"" millions of plastic pellets that escaped from its wastewater treatment works. Volunteers cleaning up the pellets at Camber Sands have described it as ""the worst single incident"" they have encountered. The water company said it believed a filter failed at its Eastbourne wastewater site. The Environment Agency said it would take ""robust enforcement action where appropriate"", while the government's water minister said she was ""deeply disappointed"". The clean-up operation is being led by Rother District Council, with help from the non-profit organisation Nurdle, which specialises in cleaning plastic pollution from beaches. Founder Josh Beech said: ""This is by far the worst spill incident we've ever seen. This is tonnes and tonnes of pollution on quite a small stretch of coastline. ""This beach has been hit by a couple of spills previously, but nothing on this scale."" He and Dominic Manning from the plastic pollution campaign group Strandliners said they were using a prototype machine to vacuum up the pellets without removing sand and other organic material. ""If they're ingested by marine life or birds they could cause them all sorts of problems, they've got toxins in them,"" said Mr Manning. ""When I came here on Thursday you could pick them up by the handful. These could be washing up anywhere along the coast of Sussex or even Kent."" Hastings and Rye MP Helena Dollimore visited the beach over the weekend and told it was ""overwhelming"" to see the ""huge number of these beads"". ""There's been a massive volunteer effort to remove as many as possible, but it's a race against time, more are coming in,"" she said. A spokesman for Southern Water said: ""We believe it is highly likely that the beads have come from our Eastbourne Wastewater Treatment Works. ""We've identified a failure of a screening filter which has apparently led to beads used in the treatment process being released into the sea during heavy rainfall. The screen should have prevented this occurring. ""We are very sorry this has happened and are doing everything possible to investigate and resolve the problem."" Water minister Emma Hardy said: ""I am deeply disappointed about the plastic pollution incident affecting Camber Sands, East Sussex. It is right that Southern Water has taken responsibility. ""The immediate priority now needs to be addressing any environmental damage and minimising further impacts."" An Environment Agency spokesman added: ""We acknowledge that Southern Water has admitted responsibility for the pollution incident. ""This is an active investigation and we will not hesitate to take robust enforcement action where appropriate."" On Monday, a Rother District Council spokesperson said: ""Whilst every effort has been made to remove as many of the pellets initially deposited on the beach as we can, it has proven impossible to remove them all. ""We also expect further large amounts to be deposited in the coming weeks and months, and officers will continue to monitor the beach to plan for the ongoing removal."" The council has urged dog owners to keep them on leads and under close supervision while on the beach to stop them from potentially eating the pellets. Meanwhile Hastings Borough Council said it had written to the chief executive of Southern Water about the incident, asking what is being done to monitor the situation and its effect on wildlife.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd771dn7no
2025-11-12,Evidence of ancient tree-climbing 'drop crocs' found in Australia,science,BBC,"Scientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to ""drop crocs"" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below. The discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America. Co-author Prof Michael Archer said ""drop crocs"" were a ""bizarre idea"" but some were ""perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner"". Prof Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago. The ""drop croc"" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain. ""It's a bizarre idea,"" Prof Archer said of the ""drop crocs"",  but some were probably ""terrestrial hunters in the forests"". The findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland. ""Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',"" Prof Archer said. Since the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane. Over the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest. ""This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,"" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said. Prof Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague ""drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard"". ""After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'. ""And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lpyrnjleeo
2025-11-12,Farming inheritance tax causing uncertainty and confusion - MPs,science,BBC,"Inheritance tax changes for farmers have created a ""climate of uncertainty and confusion"" and should be delayed, according to a group of MPs. In a report, the cross-party Welsh Affairs Committee wants a Wales-specific impact assessment before implementing the changes due to come into effect in April 2026. It accused the UK government of acting like it ""doesn't seem to care about Welsh farmers"", while one accountant said changes will affect about 92% of farmers, not the predicted 7%. An HM Treasury spokesperson said it was ""backing British farms"" by investing funds for machinery, sustainable food and action to cut EU export costs. The plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% were announced in The warning on Wednesday comes a fortnight before the next Budget. ""At the moment the government doesn't seem to care about Welsh farmers, and we're asking them to take account of the differences in Wales and halt the taxes until a full impact assessment can be made,"" said chairwoman of the committee, Ruth Jones MP. ""We're not saying no to reform, we don't want wealthy landowners getting off their taxes. ""But our farms are by and large not wealthy tax evaders, they are farms made by families and for families."" The Newport West and Islwyn Labour MP said while some of the wording of the report may be ""harsh"", it is ""accurate"". She also said the committee was asking the Welsh government to ringfence agricultural funding ""because farmers need to know what's coming down the track"". The committee said the UK government had ""a complacent approach"" to the changes it was bringing in, adding that it was a ""prime example"" of UK policy overlooking ""the distinct nature"" of farming in Wales. The committee also claim that as no data was published about the number of farms in Wales that would be affected, the ""vacuum"" was filled by organisations publishing their own statistics offering ""starkly different"" estimates of the likely impact. The UK government has said the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but unions have estimated up to 70,000 farmers could be affected. ""We feel in our practice about 92% of people will be affected, and they're talking about 7%,"" said Janet Collins, director of LHP Accountants in Carmarthen. ""So are they going to be seriously listening to the agricultural professionals, and indeed the farmers themselves? ""If it's going to be done properly, it's worth it."" She said unless this happens, it was ""kicking can the down the road"". Peter Rees and his family have run a dairy farm in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, since the 1960s, as well as a touring caravan park and more recently a wedding venue. ""That's actually sustained the farm and helped us develop the farm,"" he said. He said the investment was ""coming back to bite us now because obviously it adds to our capital value"". ""The next generation of our family want to come into the farm, want to sustain the business,"" he said, adding that the changes had created pressure because ""we have to make decisions differently"". ""We were following the advice we had prior to the potential introduction of the new tax. ""It's not as if we were complacent, it's not as if we weren't planning for it. But it's a different plan we have to put in place now and we have to do it quickly,"" he said. The committee suggests the UK government could start ""building bridges"" with Welsh farmers by pausing the planned changes so a ""proper comprehensive assessment"" can be published and scrutinised by its members. It demands the UK government recognises the ""unique cultural, environmental and economic circumstances of farming in Wales"" when making policy decisions and recommends that in future the Wales Office leads impact assessments alongside whichever department is implementing changes. Ann Davies MP, Plaid Cymru's agriculture spokesperson, said the party opposed the changes from the start ""warning that the failure to assess their impact on Welsh communities would cause real harm"". ""The UK government's complacency and lack of Welsh data have created uncertainty and confusion,"" she said. ""The upcoming Budget must right this wrong - listen to the Welsh Affairs Committee's recommendations and pause these reckless reforms until their impact has been fully assessed."" David Chadwick MP, Welsh Liberal Democrat Westminster spokesperson, said the UK government must ""urgently rethink its approach"" to the family farms tax. ""There are practical, fair alternatives on the table that would close loopholes exploited by large multinationals, without inflicting the devastating harm this policy would cause to our rural economy and communities."" The Welsh government thanked the committee and said it ""will note its conclusions"". A Treasury spokesperson said it was ""backing British farms"" with the Annual Investment Allowance ""for plant and machinery investments, billions for sustainable food and action to cut EU export costs"". ""Right now 40% of Agricultural Property Relief - worth £219m - goes to just 117 estates. Our reforms will channel that funding into vital public services.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr437eg9x65o
2025-11-12,Ancient statues stolen from Syria's National Museum,science,BBC,"Ancient statues and other artefacts have been stolen from Syria's National Museum in Damascus, officials say. The theft was discovered on Monday, when staff reportedly found that one of the museum's doors had been broken from the inside. The six missing statues were made of marble and dated back to the Roman era, one official told the Associated Press. Syria's Directorate-General for Antiquities and Museums said it had opened an investigation to determine the ""circumstances surrounding the loss of a number of exhibits"", and that measures had been taken to strengthen protection and monitoring systems. The head of internal security in Damascus province, Brig-Gen Osama Atkeh, was cited by the state-run Sana news agency as saying that security forces were investigating the theft, which he said had targeted several ""archaeological statues and rare collectibles"". He added that guards at the museum and other individuals were being questioned. The National Museum, which was established in 1919, houses the most important archaeological collection in Syria. It includes clay cuneiform tablets dating back to the 14th Century BC from Ugarit, where evidence of the oldest known complete alphabet was discovered; 1st and 2nd Century AD Greco-Roman sculptures from Palmyra, one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world; and a 3rd Century AD synagogue that was built at Dura Europos. The museum was forced to close in 2012, one year after the start of the devastating civil war. Most of the collection was evacuated and kept at secret locations to protect them. and resumed full operations in January 2025, a month after rebel forces overthrew President Bashar al-Assad. All six of Syria's Unesco World Heritages sites were damaged or partially destroyed during the civil war. The Islamic State group blew up several temples and other structures at Palmyra, claiming that they were idolatrous. Unesco condemned the destruction as a war crime.

2025-11-12,Tip booking system pushed back to 'early 2026',science,BBC,"The introduction of a booking system at four household tips has been pushed back to ""early 2026"", Dorset Council has said. The scheme at Dorchester, Wimborne, Shaftesbury and Sherborne aims to reduce congestion and prevent misuse by commercial users and people from outside the county. It had originally be due to launch in 2025, but the authority said the extra time would allow it to make sure the system was working smoothly. Residents will be able to book free of charge, either online or by phone, while non-Dorset residents will pay a fee. Updates on the exact start date and how to book will be released at a later date. Place services councillor Jon Andrews said: ""We're taking a little extra time to make sure the system works smoothly for everyone. ""This is about delivering a better experience for residents and ensuring the service remains fair, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible."" Dorset Council's original plan to introduce booking at all 10 of its sites prompted a backlash, leading it to It said ""alternative measures"" would be explored to combat commercial misuse at Bridport, Swanage, Weymouth, Portland, Wareham and Blandford. About 20% of the waste received at Shaftesbury and Sherborne comes from outside of the county, according to the council, with the cost currently being met by council tax payers. Residents from across the county border in Somerset and Wiltshire will still be able to use both tips but will be required to pay an entry fee.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205yn1j3y0o
2025-11-11,Hillside chalk lion figure restored by volunteers,science,BBC,"A piece of hillside chalk art depicting a lion has been restored by a team of dancing and stomping volunteers. Whipsnade Zoo used 1,100 tonnes of chalk to restore the landmark near the attraction in Bedfordshire. A team of about 60 volunteers had to use their feet to stamp the freshly laid chalk into place on the 147-metre-long lion, thought to be the largest hill figure in England. Sara Nicholas, volunteer advisor at the zoo, said: ""There were some very unique approaches to stamping, with a few groups breaking out a line dance, or 'lion dance', to make sure their section was well and truly compacted."" Construction on the hillside figure took two years and started in 1931. It was covered during World War Two (1939-45) so enemy aircraft could not use it as a navigation point. The former Mayor of Dacorum Gbola Adeleke after  he was concerned the figure was not being maintained properly, but the zoo declined. The restoration project has seen volunteers remove weeds and replace chalk. New chalk had previously been added in 2018 but the zoo wanted to give it another makeover ahead of the Zoological Society of London's 200th anniversary.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gydxrv4eo
2025-11-12,Rare fungus spotted in New Forest for first time,science,BBC,"A fungi, which looks like a candelabra, has been found in a national park for the first time. The New Forest National Park Authority (NFNPA) said the nationally rare fungus, Candelabra Coral, known for its striking crown-tipped creamy white branches, had been spotted growing in recent weeks at six sites in the forest. Professor Russell Wynn, director of Wild New Forest, who made one of the finds said the ""sudden arrival of the Candelabra Coral in the New Forest this autumn is remarkable."" He said said the reason for its appearance was not clear but ""given its distinctive and identifiable species, it is unlikely that it would have been overlooked in the past."" After not being seen for decades the fungus was rediscovered in Suffolk in 2012 and has since been recorded in at least 10 English counties during the past five years. The fungus, can grow up to 10cm high and thrives on decaying deadwood in moist woodland environments. One of the areas where it was found is within part of the Species Survival Fund (SSF) project. Led by the park authority, SSF is a £1.3m project with five partner organisations. It is working to help halt species decline and restore habitats in the New Forest covering an area the size of 350 football pitches. So far, the scheme has planted wildflower meadows, crated ponds, and restored heathlands and woodlands to help wildlife flourish. As part of the project, Wild New Forest has carried out wildlife surveys to understand the area's biodiversity and identify priority species before restoration work was carried out.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdrezll01do
2025-11-11,Families of Camp Mystic victims sue owners over deadly Texas flood,science,BBC,"The families of some of the victims who died in devastating floods at Camp Mystic have sued the Texas Christian camp, accusing its owners of gross negligence and failing to protect children in their care. Twenty-seven children and counsellors died after flash floods swept through central Texas over the 4 July holiday. The families of seven victims allege that the camp's owners knew about the flood risk but did not take steps to prevent and evacuate campers from danger. The lawsuit, filed on Monday in state court in Austin, is seeking more than $1m in damages. The suit comes after the camp announced it would partially reopen next year, drawing criticism from some of the victims' families. ""These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,"" the lawsuit said. A lawyer for the camp's owners said while it empathised with victims, he disagreed with some of the accusations. More than 130 people died in the central Texas floods that shocked the nation and brought into sharp relief several emergency warning failures in the state. The tragedy at the young girls' camp, established in 1926, received particular attention given the flood-prone location. The camp's co-owner and director Dick Eastland also died in the flood. The lawsuit accuses the camp's owners of not heeding warning about its cabin locations along the Guadalupe River as well as the oncoming severe rain. ""The camp ignored warnings about the risky location of its cabins,"" the lawsuit said. ""It ignored warnings about the approaching 4 July storm and life-threatening flood risks. It ignored the obvious and rising flood risks that morning as the hours passed. It ignored warnings from its own counsellors to evacuate the cabins. It simply ignored the unmistakable safety threat to its campers and counsellors until this tragedy was unavoidable."" According to the lawsuit, some of the victims' parents were campers themselves when they were young. An attorney for the camp's operators said the flood was unprecedented in nature. ""We empathise with the families of the campers and counsellors and all families in the Hill Country who lost loved ones in the horrific and unprecedented flood of July 4,"" Jeff Ray said in a statement to the BBC. ""We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area,"" he added. Camp Mystic also told the BBC in a statement they ""continue to pray for the grieving families and ask for God's healing and comfort"". The wrongful death suit filed in Texas state court is not the first against the camp. Another group of six victims families have sued the camp. The parents of eight-year-old Eloise ""Lulu"" Peck have also separately sued the camp. In response to the tragedy, Texas lawmakers have passed legislation that would restrict the establishment of camps in flood-risk zones, mandate emergency training for camp owners and staff and fund the installation of emergency sirens across the state.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdegj3g6gg3o
2025-11-12,Badger rescued after falling down manhole,science,BBC,"An ""inquisitive"" badger landed himself in a tricky spot after falling down an open manhole. A passer-by spotted the animal 4ft (1.2m) down a shaft behind an office in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county. But it was a two-person job to lift him out, and specialist equipment had to be used by an RSPCA team and the Clywd Badger Group. Fortunately, the curious creature was not harmed during his escapade on Saturday and scuttled off as soon as he was freed. Dan Rose, from the badger group, said the animal was lucky to have been found so quickly. ""The poor badger must have had quite a shock falling into the manhole, but thanks to the quick action of locals who spotted him, he was safely lifted out and returned to the wild,"" he said. He added that badgers can be ""really inquisitive creatures"" particularly at this time of year when they forage for food before winter - which can land them in ""tricky spots"". RSPCA inspector Louise Showering said: ""It was a two-person job and it required a long grasper and a reptile bag on a pole to hoist him out. ""He was uninjured and quickly ran off. He was so quick I struggled to get a decent picture of him."" The manhole has now been covered.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn40dkkpvz5o
2025-11-13,Fossil fuel emissions rise again - but renewables boom offers hope for climate,science,BBC,"The world's burning of fossil fuels is set to release more planet-warming carbon dioxide than ever before this year, new figures show. It is another sign that efforts to fight climate change by cutting emissions are moving far too slowly to meet international targets, as countries meet in Brazil for UN climate talks COP30. But emissions have grown much less quickly over the past decade as renewables have taken off, providing hope that the world's warming trend can still be curbed. And separate analysis by clean energy think tank Ember suggests that fossil fuel use in electricity generation has flatlined in 2025, largely thanks to the rapid growth of solar power. It adds weight to the idea that global emissions may be nearing a peak – even though it's hard to say exactly when that might come. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 2025 are of course an estimate, with the year not yet complete – but they show a mixed picture. Emissions from fossil fuels and cement are forecast to increase yet again to 38.1bn tonnes of CO2, according to the Global Carbon Budget team, which comprises more than 130 scientists from 21 countries. Emissions from changing land-use – such as permanent deforestation – are forecast to be lower than last year, however. That's largely due to the end of the - which can drive higher forest losses – but is the continuation of a longer-term trend. It means that, altogether, total emissions from all human activities are expected to reach 42.2bn tonnes CO2 in 2025 - down from the 42.4bn in 2024, albeit marginally. What is clearer, the team say, is that emissions have grown more slowly over the past decade - 0.3% per year - compared to the previous decade's 1.9% per year. And over the past 10 years, 35 countries significantly cut their fossil fuel emissions while also growing their economies, they say. That is nearly double the number in the decade before. ""We're not yet in a situation where the emissions go down [as] rapidly as they need to, to tackle climate change, but at the same time there are a lot of positive [developments]"" said Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia. Emissions have been growing much less rapidly than before ""because of that extraordinary growth in renewable energy in China and elsewhere"", she added. This effect of the renewables boom is highlighted by emissions in the power or electricity sector. Electricity generated from fossil fuels is forecast to flatline or even decline slightly this year, according to the think tank Ember, for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic. What's unusual about this year, Ember says, is that this has happened even though electricity demand increased sharply, rather than resulting from an economic recession. And this year's extra electricity demand has been more than met by wind and, particularly, solar. ""We've had decades and centuries where fossil fuels were the only way that we could really grow our economy, and over the last decade, that's changed for the first time,"" said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember. ""Solar power is growing at a record pace, and faster than any electricity source in history,"" he added. What happens in the power sector is particularly important in the fight against climate change. It is the single biggest emitting sector and is expected to play an increasing role in the energy system as more people buy electric cars, heat pumps and other technologies. ""Whatever happens in the power sector has an outsized influence on what happens for emissions worldwide,"" said Mr Fulghum. Ember is confident that emissions from using fossil fuels to generate electricity are now plateauing and could begin a permanent decline in a few years. That echoes yesterday's message from the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog. Carbon emissions from energy systems – more than just electricity - could peak within the next few years, based on countries' stated policies, it said. While there is still uncertainty about the exact timing of a peak, it would undoubtedly be a landmark moment in the fight against climate change. It would not halt warming, however, as countries would still be adding CO2 to the atmosphere - just at a slower rate. ""As long as we emit CO2, the warming will continue… to stop further warming, we have to bring [net] emissions to zero,"" said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, chair in mathematical modelling of climate systems at the University of Exeter. And another analysis released today to coincide with COP30 offers a reality check. The Climate Action Tracker research group finds that warming could reach 2.6C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century based on current policies – a figure which has barely changed over the past few years. ""It's very clear that we have never had a better chance to do this. It's also clear that we've never been in a worse situation,"" said Dr Bill Hare, from the Climate Action Tracker team. ""So it's a diabolical dilemma. Things could go really badly. We could walk away from this COP without taking the right kind of action, and entrenching fossil gas and oil, and we'll push towards 2.5C [or] 3C warming for sure,"" he added. ""But on the other hand, the chance is there… to do exactly the opposite, and to build on the momentum of the technology changes going on globally."" to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Several species of fish, including what the EA described as ""large and valuable"" carp, have been dying at a small fishing lake in the hamlet of Rokemarsh, near Wallingford, Oxfordshire, since the end of October. They were discovered by members of a fishing club who told the BBC at one stage they were finding around 200 fish dead per day. Thames Water, which has been undertaking work to fix sewer issues in Rokemarsh, said it was aware and investigating. Martin Pugh, from fishing club 10 Trees, said he first noticed dead fish rising to the water's surface at the end of October. ""That's carried on [since], and we've been carrying, picking fish out and waiting for the big ones to float up"". Fellow club member Les Bond said it was ""very upsetting"". ""Each day I go round and scoop out these fish,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like this"". The EA said: ""We responded to reports of dead fish at a pond at Roke, near Wallingford, on 28 October to investigate what killed around 1,000 fish, including large and valuable carp. ""Initial water samples showed normal results for levels of dissolved oxygen, but specialist officers are undertaking further analysis to identify the cause of this devastating loss of fish."" The BBC was shown numerous small fish floating on the lake's surface. Several large carp lay nearby in bags after being removed. The lake, previously a man-made watercress bed, is fed from an underground spring. Its outlet eventually feeds into the River Thames. Mr Pugh said they were now waiting for the EA to continue testing before they would be able to restock and resume fishing. Thames Water said it was aware of the incident and was investigating alongside the EA.

2025-11-13,Farmer says losing vet services is 'catastrophic',science,BBC,"A farmer said a decision by their vet to stop working with farms will be ""catastrophic"" for their animals' welfare. Kirree Kermode, from Orrisdale Farm in Ballasalla, raised concerns after Milan Veterinary Practice said it would cease its farming services on 30 November. The vets said the decision was made because of a ""long-term decline"" in the number of farm clients, and ""the wider decline of pastoral farming on the island"". Ms Kermode, whose family farm has almost 2,000 animals, said the service was ""critical to the function of our business"" and they were unlikely to find another vets to take on their ""vast"" farming enterprise. Orrisdale Farm has 1,500 commercial sheep, 200 pedigree sheep, and 300 beef cattle. Ms Kermode said while they could try other vets, many were already at capacity and they did not know their stock. They were also not the only farm to be affected by the move, she added. Ms Kermode said the farm dealt with the vets not just for emergency care but for vaccination and health programmes, as well as preparation for meat export. ""We need the vet, we need a set up we can rely on,"" she said. ""If we have an emergency in the middle of the night in three weeks' time, what are we going to do? ""The animal is absolutely paramount in the whole of this. It's very nerve-racking,"" she said. The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture said it was ""actively engaging with veterinary practices and industry representatives to assess the situation and explore potential solutions"". It said in a statement: ""Our immediate priority is maintaining animal welfare and ensuring farmers continue to have access to veterinary care for their livestock."" It added that the situation was ""a priority for the department"".

2025-11-12,From Brazil to Belfast - pupils hold their own COP30 event,science,BBC,"While COP30 takes place in Brazil, more than 80 pupils have been holding their own climate talks closer to home. The COP30 climate simulation negotiation brought pupils from 28 schools to Belfast Castle, where they represented countries, campaigners, lobbyists and journalists. This year's event was the first to bring together young people from both sides of the border, with four pupils from Dundalk Grammar School taking part. The pupils negotiated with each other to make international deals, and made speeches - one of which was even interrupted by a mock climate protest. Blaithin, 17, and Niamh, 16, from St Catherine's College Armagh, were leading the event, which was organised by the British Council, as UN secretary generals. They were tasked with bringing all the participants to an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, supporting developing nations and adapting to the effects of climate change. Blaithin said despite COP30 taking place thousands of miles away, it was important to her generation. ""As a young person, knowing that we will face the impact of what's going to happen in the future, it's very relevant that we understand what is going on,"" she said. ""We have to live the life that's going to be controlled by what happens today."" Niamh thinks more could be done to educate young people about climate change. ""Social media is a big part of young people's lives, so I feel if we took more to social media for climate action, it would really influence young people today,"" she said. Jude, 17, from Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, said discussing climate change with young people from across Northern Ireland was a ""great experience"", but it's business people who should be talking about it more. ""It's them who are doing the most damage, and they need to realise that if they keep killing the planet, they won't have any more customers."" He worries that due to the gradual effects of climate change, ""the average person will only realise we need to change when the floods come to their doors and the droughts dry out their water supplies"". Lily-May, 18, also from Shimna Integrated College, said while it was ""enlightening"" meeting other young people passionate about the climate, most of her peers are ""not really engaged"". ""I think people just don't want to take the extra step or go their extra mile to be more environmentally friendly, even just by using a different bin."" Colm McGivern, British Council Northern Ireland Director, said: ""It's wonderful to give young people the opportunity to think about one of the major international challenges facing the globe. ""It's really interesting to see how they've gripped the arguments and are getting into the detail, which is crucial if we're to be able to persuade people about the importance of working against climate change."" Environment Minister Andrew Muir, who made a speech at the event, said he was ""inspired and uplifted"" to hear young people engaging with climate action. ""To be honest, today stands in stark contrast to some of the politics in recent weeks in Northern Ireland. ""There's collective will, there's hope, there's positivity, and that's why I'm committed to working with young people on this issue."" Kayla , from Coleraine Grammar, who was representing the USA, said she thinks the minister's attendance at the event ""shows his commitment to it"". ""Obviously climate change is a big deal for any young person, but I don't think we do too much about it,"" she said. ""Coming here to the event, you realise how the daily things have an impact, how much countries aren't doing about it, and how much they could be doing.

2025-11-12,SSE to invest £33bn in upgrading Scotland's electricity grid,science,BBC,"The company that controls the electricity grid in the north of Scotland has announced plans to invest £33bn over five years. SSE has set out plans to spend two-thirds of that to upgrade wiring and increase high-voltage grid capacity to get power from the north to customers in the south. However, the Perth-based company faces strong criticism of some its plans, for the impact they will have on the Highlands and rural Aberdeenshire. The plans include erecting tall pylons and and building large sub-stations. The other third of the new investment plan is partly for lower-voltage wiring in the two areas where the company has the distribution franchise and monopoly - the north of Scotland and central southern England, where it took over Southern Electric 27 years ago. That will take £5bn of the investment plan up to 2030, some of it to improve the capacity of homes to run air heat converters and car charging through household meters. The company is putting a reduced share of its investment effort into offshore wind power, though it remains a major developer in the North Sea. SSE is constructing the Dogger Bank wind farm, which will be the world's largest, and it has permission to build the Berwick Bank array, off the south-east coast of Scotland, which will then become the world's largest when it is completed. Martin Pibworth, the company's new chief executive, is confident that the plan is ""focussed, disciplined and comprehensively funded"". That funding process began with the successful placing, on Tuesday morning, of £2bn-worth of new SSE shares, taken up by existing investors. Unusually for a utility, its share price rose nearly 16% at its peak, before ending the day 11% up. Other funding will come through the company's income from its current assets, and from debt. who took over from Alistair Phillips-Davies as chief executive of SSE three months ago, is also confident that there will be sufficient skills to carry out the work. The networks transmission division is expanding its staff five-fold to 2,500 by shifting people within SSE, while recruiting apprentices, graduates and seeking out those in the offshore oil and gas industry. More widely, SSE directly employs 7,000 people in Scotland, and more than 10,000 indirectly, while that extends to a total of nearly 49,000 across the UK. However, the company faces criticism about the scale of the 11 major transmission projects it has under way - similar to the difficulties in winning community support for grid connections in England and Wales, where National Grid plc runs the network, and in the south of Scotland, where the monopoly provider of high-voltage cabling is Scottish Power. Community councils from across the Highlands have come together to raise their concerns. The Highland Council recently published a strongly-worded critique of one of the most contentious power lines, stretching 107 miles from the north of Caithness through eastern Sutherland and Easter Ross to the central Highland village of Beauly. That is now the meeting point for four major lines, and will require an additional, very large sub-station. Although the local and planning authority is responsible for land along the entire route of the line, the project goes to the Scottish government for planning approval. Mr Pibworth told BBC Scotland News: ""We've carried out the widest, broadest consultation ever held in the north of Scotland. ""We've held 250-plus meetings with communities, to make sure they understand the plan. ""The rewiring of Scotland needs to be done. We need to get renewables (energy) flowing through to demand centres. ""We need to make sure we have an energy system which is reliable, that is not exposed to international markets and geopolitics through gas price volatility, that is secure and clean, and that is resourced with good jobs in our local communities. ""Those plans are being pulled together now,"" the chief executive said. ""We are listening to councils and communities, and trying to work with them, to make sure we can adopt where it's possible to do so. ""But these networks have to be built, for the good of the economy and for green jobs and for the good of prosperity as we electrify our economy."" He conceded there is growing political debate about the affordability of the transition to green power, but responded: ""There is no doubt in my mind that renewables represent the lowest cost of energy to the consumer, that it's in the best interests of the consumer to build out the infrastructure we're building out. ""It is clean. It is green. I'm absolutely confident we're on the right path."" He also praised the UK and Scottish governments for their role in supporting further renewable energy development, saying the UK has become the best market for such investments, where other countries have scaled back their ambitions. because it is unable to find accommodation for the workers needed to install new infrastructure. After the work is done, the homes will be handed over for sale as affordable homes or for social housing. Its investment plan was welcomed by Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7mk5np141o
2025-11-13,Our dogs' diversity can be traced back to the Stone Age,science,BBC,"If you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable. But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought. ""When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,"" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study. She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago. , this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution. They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives. This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads. Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age. ""It's really surprising,"" she said. ""And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this."" Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle. This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication. Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food. Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near. As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: ""It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see. ""It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one."" For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In , a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China. They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years. I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7j89ykro
2025-11-14,Dig uncovers secrets of first public railway,science,BBC,"Archaeologists have said they have uncovered ''fascinating new features"" to show how the world's first public railway was built. An archaeological dig has been taking place on a section of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway Line (S&DR) at Preston Park, Stockton-on-Tees, which was in use between 1825 and 1852. The 26-mile line from Shildon to Stockton was the first public railway to use steam locomotives to carry passengers and freight, transforming the way people traded, travelled and communicated. Among the finds are stone sleepers and clues about how the line was dismantled in the mid-19th Century. Dr Emma Watson, who is leading the project, said: ''Some of things we've discovered are unheard of and unknown and have changed the way we understand this area.'' She said it had been thought that only timber sleepers were used east of Darlington, but the team discovered eight broken stone sleepers with their original markings which indicated they had also been used on that section of the track. Tees Archaeology, the organisation behind the dig, said it also found evidence of what was carried on the tracks, which was mainly coal, coke and limestone. The team also uncovered metalwork which helped them understand how the track bed had been dismantled in 1852. The organisation said the task had been an ''unprecedented honour"". The dig was part of a host of events and celebrations that have been taking place this year to mark the Reuben Kench from Stockton Council said the response from the public to the celebrations ""has illustrated the pride they feel, saying this is our area and this is our achievement"". The first journey on the S&DR took place on 27 September 1825.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74je9d1l8xo
2025-11-14,Photographer's focus captured by escaped flamingo,science,BBC,"A French amateur wildlife photographer says he will continue to monitor the flamingo which escaped from a wildlife sanctuary in Cornwall and made its way to northern France. , despite her feathers being clipped on one wing to prevent her from reaching full flight. The bird was eventually spotted in Goulven Bay in northern France - where she is thought to have settled. Mickaël Belliot, who lives near Brest and is a nature guide in the area, said he had ""developed an affection"" for Frankie and her story. Mr Belliot said he was ""very surprised"" the first time he saw Frankie in Goulven Bay, in northern France. He often photographs birds on the estuary there, and said his friends did not believe him when he told them he had seen a flamingo. ""I sent some photos that same evening to my friends who didn't believe me, they told me that it was probably AI photos. ""Obviously the next day when I told them about the Paradise Park post they had to believe me."" Mr Belliot said Goulven Bay is a ""remarkable place"" for birds. After his first sighting of Frankie, he said he ""developed an affection for this bird, so for three days, not finding it, I began to wonder what had happened"". ""So you can imagine my joy yesterday when I found her on a small island on the edge of the bay and I was finally able to take good photos again."" Mr Belliot said the young flamingo was ""taking a nap at high tide"" and seemed to be ""in great shape"". ""I was really happy to see her again. I will continue to monitor the area and above all I hope that she will acclimatise to her new wild life."" He said people in France were ""really starting to be interested"" in Frankie. Previously, David Woolcock, a curator at Paradise Park, said there were ""numerous issues"" with the idea of bringing Frankie back to the park, including avian influenza. ""If she were to be caught in France she would then need to be housed at a French institution to be health screened as part of the UK importation process,"" he said. ""But it is unlikely that [anyone] would agree to hold Frankie as she has been mixing with wild birds and may have been in contact with avian influenza-infected birds. ""Avian influenza continues to be a major threat to wild birds and we hope that Frankie remains safe and healthy.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjr4gn1z2go
2025-11-14,Bailiwick charity first for King's award,science,BBC,"A conservation group has become the first Bailiwick charity to receive a prestigious award from King Charles III. Guernsey Conservation Volunteers (GCV), which has been conserving the Bailiwick of Guernsey's natural environment for almost 30 years, has received The King's Award for Voluntary Service. It is the highest award a local voluntary group can receive in the UK and Channel Islands and the equivalent of an MBE. Angela Salmon, GCV's operations director, said receiving the award was a ""huge honour"" and hoped it would ""further raise awareness and the profile of conservation needs in our island and of the value of volunteering"". The group said its current project to maintain and enhance nature on the island was focused on removing invasive stinking onions, which were ""really taking over"" in Bluebell Wood. Ms Salmon said: ""Now we see them all over the island and when you've got a special site like this for the bluebells... we really wanted to make an impact."" She said if no action was taken, the native bluebells would be lost forever and Bluebell Wood would ""eventually turn white"" from the invasive plant. ""When the bluebells are flowering, there are hundreds of people that visit this site and it's just special to our community,"" she said. One of the volunteers, Andy Walker, said: ""You're around people, you're in nature. It's fabulous. Everyone's helping out and it's good camaraderie."" More than 200 volunteers have supported GCV conservation activities in 2025, but more were always ""very welcome to join"".

2025-11-15,Conservationists celebrate barn owl increase,science,BBC,"Volunteers are celebrating a rise in their local barn owl population. Tees Valley Wildlife Trust said in 2025, the area it covers saw a 42% increase in the number of barn owls ringed, rising from 249 in 2024 to 354. Colin Gibson, volunteer barn owl coordinator and a retired police officer, said he believed the increase could be down to increased habitat protection, improved nesting sites and favourable climate conditions. The trust has been running the project for more than 12 years to try and improve the local population by building more than 400 nest boxes. The trust said man-made boxes were now essential for owls to survive because in recent years their natural nesting sites in old trees and derelict buildings had been lost due to ash dieback and old farm buildings being modernised. Working alongside the Tees Ringing Group, eggs and chicks were counted and ringed with each owlet given a unique number to be able to track them. The nest boxes were also often used by other birds such as tawny owls, kestrels, stock doves and jackdaws, the trust said. Mr Gibson said although the breeding season was over for the year, volunteers remained active building new boxes and repairing old ones.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg10g2d7g9o
2025-11-14,Dog swept away in river torrent as storms hit,science,BBC,"A search is under way for a dog who was swept away when she jumped into a higher than usual river. Her owner, AJ Abrar, had to be rescued by emergency services when he went into the water to help four-year-old Bonnie at Arrow Country Park in Redditch, Worcestershire, on Wednesday. He had managed to catch hold of her but had to let her go to save himself, he said. Heavy rain affected parts of the West Midlands this week, with several flood alerts issued and rivers higher than usual. On Friday, homes and businesses in Herefordshire were affected by flooding. Rail services have been disrupted and seven schools in Herefordshire shut. Mr Abrar said he had managed to cling on to a large log in the river but had been eventually forced to let go of the dog to stop himself from drowning. Mix-breed Bonnie was a strong swimmer, he said, and had often jumped in the river there to chase sticks he threw when the water levels were lower. A passer-by rang the emergency services who helped him out and he said a search team was planning to help him look for his missing dog over the weekend. ""We're going to go look for a body, or anything, whatever we can find, and start searching until we can bring her home,"" he said. People were out searching on Friday, and were trying not to lose hope, he said. ""She was an amazing dog, she was a TikTok star."" had accumulated more than 3,500 followers. In Ewyas Harold, in Herefordshire, flood water has been filmed flowing through the streets and into homes. Gino Fulgoni, the landlord of the local pub, described the scenes as ""upsetting"". He said people in the town were frustrated that this had happened again and some people had only just cleaned up after last year's flood. Mr Fulgoni added: ""It's just not fair that there are businesses that go through their whole trading life and they don't have to deal with this and we deal with it on a yearly basis it would seem. Flood defences have been installed along the River Wye in Hereford and pumps are being installed in Worcester Defences are already up on Beales Corner and Severnside in Bewdley, with Hylton Road in Worcester also closing to allow flood pumps to be installed. The Met Office said fast flowing or deep flood water was likely, causing a danger to life, and drivers are advised to avoid going through standing water. , and due to the forecast weather conditions, bosses added they were unable to operate buses to replace affected services. There were reduced services on the Cross City Line from Lichfield Trent Valley and Birmingham New Street to Redditch and Bromsgrove, with two trains per hour operating on this route throughout the day. West Midlands Railway also said a tree brought down in Storm Claudia had struck by a train at Blakedown in Worcestershire, damaging the train and blocking the line. That has now been cleared, but the rail operator asked for patience over the running of services. In Herefordshire, Ross-on-Wye parkrun, which had been due to take place on Saturday has been cancelled. On Facebook, organisers said: ""We are reluctantly having to cancel again this week, as both the A course and the B course are just not OK."" Herefordshire Council has also said it has liaised with the Met Office and Environment Agency and was sending extra staff across the county for the whole of the weekend to deal with issues on the roads. People were reminded not to drive past road closed signs and advised that driving through flood water could also impact surrounding properties.

2025-11-15,How dinosaur fossils were found on an island with 'the wrong rocks',science,BBC,"Finding dinosaur fossils on the island of Ireland is harder than finding a ""needle in a haystack"", the curator of geology at National Museums Northern Ireland has said. But the only two ever to have been found in the proverbial haystack will be on display in Cork for the next six months. Fossil collector Roger Byrne found fossilised bones of two separate dinosaur species on the same beach in Islandmagee, County Antrim, more than four decades ago. From Sunday, they will be on display as part of an exhibition at Glucksman Gallery in University College Cork (UCC), where for the first time the public can also see nearly 300 fossils from elsewhere. The fossils are from 200 million years ago, meaning these dinosaurs roamed Earth during the Jurassic period. Dr Mike Simms, from National Museums Northern Ireland, told BBC News NI that Ireland is an unlikely candidate for dinosaur-related discoveries because ""we have the wrong sort of rocks"". ""Most of the rocks that would contain dinosaurs that would be of the right age, we don't have,"" he said. ""They were eroded away long ago, so we're very, very lucky to have these. ""Most of the rocks we have that are the right age for dinosaurs were deposited out at sea."" The fossils are normally on display at the Ulster Museum but they are being loaned to UCC. ""There will be big, spectacular, skeleton casts in this exhibition in Cork but alongside them will be these little bits of bone,"" said Dr Simms. ""I think it's a great opportunity because Cork is quite a long way away, so it's great that they get down to Cork for six months and people can appreciate them there."" Mr Byrne taught at a school in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, and was ""a very keen, enthusiastic fossil collector"" who was ""meticulous"". He found the bones in 1980 and 1981, on a beach near the Gobbins in County Antrim. Dr Simms, who met him a few times, said he was a talented artist who drew the dinosaur bones he found. ""He was a really exceptional fossil collector - a very good eye - because these bones are basically rather rounded black pebbles and he found them on a beach that was covered with black pebbles."" One is part of the lower leg bone of a carnivore similar to Sarcosaurus; the other is from the upper leg bone of a Scelidosaurus, a four-legged herbivore. ""It's an extraordinary find really, to find two different dinosaurs in a country which really we shouldn't have,"" Dr Simms said. So could there be more fossils on Islandmagee beaches? ""Quite a few other people and Roger scoured it pretty carefully,"" Dr Simms said. ""I don't think there was really that much left after Roger had been back. He went back many times and his collection was donated to us after he died."" Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin, who will open the Domain of the Dinosaurs exhibition on Sunday, called it ""a fantastic collaboration of science and the arts that truly captures the imagination"". The Islandmagee fossils will be joined by skeletal casts of the eight-metre-long apex predator Megalosaurus, the herbivores Scelidosaurus and Iguanodon, and the marine reptiles Ichythyosaurus and Plesiosaurus.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y92wg8q8po
2025-11-16,Citizen science tackles invisible river pollution,science,BBC,"Sewage in our waterways has long been a major concern but, in Dorset, hundreds of volunteers are tackling a bigger, but lesser known, threat to our rivers. According to Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT), agriculture accounts for about 60% of the pollution in the county's rivers. Add that to medicines, household detergents, garden chemicals and common pet treatments and the problems start to stack up for these fragile eco systems. Two citizen science projects - Riverfly and Water Guardians - are working to tackle this combined and often invisible threat and protect these precious habitats. The Riverfly Partnership is a national project with surveys in Dorset managed by DWT. About 120 volunteers monitor 67 key sites in the county, taking monthly samples to measure the presence of aquatic invertebrates, providing an early warning system for potential pollution incidents. ""Aquatic insects are the foundation of the river eco system,"" explains Hannah Divine of DWT. ""A lot of them are really sensitive to any forms of pollution."" DWT says only 15% of the county's rivers are in good ecological health and none are in good overall health. Patricia Zimmerman, who has been volunteering for about four years, describes the insects as ""the canaries of the river"". ""It takes a bit of time to learn the invertebrates but, if you do it regularly, you can spot trends very quickly and notice if anything has changed."" Volunteers don waders to carry out the monthly surveys from spring to autumn, with concerns reported to water companies or the Environment Agency. But much of the pollution is not from a single source, it's a build-up of everyday chemicals, referred to as diffuse pollution. Many pet owners are unaware that some flea and tick treatments contain neonicotinoids - bee-killing pesticides that are banned in agriculture. The chemicals have been detected in Dorset's rivers and streams in concentrations exceeding safe limits for wildlife. They are deposited by animals drinking and bathing in the water, and by their waste, washed down drains or leached through the soil during rainfall. ""It's really detrimental to wildlife,"" said Ms Divine. ""A lot of aquatic insects are really sensitive to any forms of pollution. People just do not know and think they are doing the right thing by their pets."" Hormones from human medicines are also having an effect, along with the build-up of everyday chemicals used in homes and businesses. DWT also manages the county's Water Guardians - a year-round project funded by Wessex Water involving 86 volunteers who, between them, walk nearly 100 miles (160km) of their local river banks each month looking for visible signs of pollution. Ms Divine, the project's co-ordinator, said: ""We have got a hotline to report to Wessex Water and they come and investigate, usually within 24 hours, and they keep us updated. ""We do lots of additional training, like aquatic plant ID. The teams also do Himalayan balsam pulling so they are involved in invasive species management as well."" Monitors have also detected other problems, including acute spills and farm pollution, which have been investigated by the Environment Agency. Ms Zimmerman, who volunteers for both projects, has spent her entire career in science and environmental education but says anyone with an interest can take part. ""It's a nice thing to do if you are passionate about the rivers,"" she said. ""I've got several sites I monitor and do it with different people. I've made lots of new friends, it's a great social thing. ""Having taught about the environment for so many years, it was something I wanted to keep doing when I retired. ""And what could be nicer than sitting beside a river on a sunny day?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629e0dlvg6o
2025-11-16,Cumbria stories you might have missed this week,science,BBC,"Here are a few Cumbria stories you might have missed out on this week. A council-owned venue will have to reschedule dozens of shows after a fresh delay in work to remove crumbling concrete. The Sands Centre in Carlisle, Cumbria, was shut in September 2023 to allow for 200 tonnes of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) to be removed. Cumberland Council, which owns the building, had initially said it would reopen for this autumn's season, but the date was pushed back to early 2026. The authority has now confirmed shows will be rescheduled until mid-June. The Labour-led council blamed delays on damage caused by Storm Eowyn earlier this year, which damaged a temporary canopy. A charity in Carlisle providing help and support for homeless young people in the city says the problem is often hidden. Carlisle Key has two houses in the city where young people can live short term. It was one of the projects in Cumbria that Children In Need funded last year. Find out more about what is being done to Huge landslides occur in their hundreds every year across the UK, with many causing significant damage and some resulting in fatalities. But what actually causes them and why are they shutting down travel routes? Cumbria has experienced its fair share of landslides and experts are warning they could become more common. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Is the problem going to get worse? McDonald's has said it will address a one-star rating given to one of its restaurants with ""the utmost importance and urgency"". Inspectors found improvements ""needed to be made immediately on hygienic food handling including preparation, cooking, re-heating, cooling and storage"" at a McDonald's outlet in Dalton Road, Barrow-in Furness. Inspectors also said there were issues with pest control, hand-washing facilities and ventilation. A spokesperson fpr McDonald's said the fast food chain was ""addressing the matters identified by the environmental health officer (EHO) with the utmost importance and urgency"".

2025-11-16,Move over açaí - the Amazon has more 'superfoods' to offer,science,BBC,"In a lab in a renovated warehouse on the banks of a churning, brown river in Belém, Brazil, machines are pulping candidates for the next global ""superfood"". Cupuaçu... Taperebá... Bacaba... Like açaí berries - these fruits are rich in antioxidants, fibre or fatty acids. If Brazil has its way, they could soon be popping up on your social media feeds and being sold in fashionable cafes in the UK, Europe and the US. It's part of a bold plan by the country, which is hosting the COP30 UN climate talks, to tackle climate change, protect nature and create wealth in the face of considerable regional poverty. ""There's a lot of superfoods in the forest that people don't know,"" says Max Petrucci, founder of a local company Mahta that sells powdered cacao and Brazil nuts for shakes. The drink he gives me to try is gritty and tastes like chocolate without sugar. ""We're focussed first on nutrition and the health benefits that these Amazonian ingredients provide,"" he explains. But the second benefit, he explains, is ""social and environmental"". He says they pay fair prices and only buy from farmers who practice sustainable farming. It sounds like a marketing pitch and the company's slick packaging promises ""ancestral ingredients"" and the ""power of purple fruits from the forest"". Scientific research into the benefits of ""superfoods"" is limited, but Larissa Bueno, also at Mahta, explains that they only sell powdered foods - ""similar to Huel in the UK,"" she says. Transporting raw fruits that degrade within days of picking is expensive. But if companies freeze dry ingredients into powders to sell to supermarkets or ship abroad, ""it keeps more of the nutritional value and it's a smart way to keep more economic value in Brazil"", she explains. The lab in Belém's Bioeconomy Park is helping small companies test new ways of preserving fruits. ""People have been eating from these forests for more than 10,000 years. There are many, many, many undiscovered superfoods, "" Max says. The Amazon rainforest, which covers 6 million sq km (2.3 million sq miles), has always been full of natural wealth. But for decades its vast ecosystem has been decaying, with areas chopped down to sell timber or clear space for cattle or crops like soy. This damaged one of the earth's great protections against climate change - trees that soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide. , rather than energy like most countries. Those emissions mainly stem from cutting down forest or growing vast amounts of food. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to halve deforestation by 2030. In the 12 months to July 2025, rates reached an 11-year low. But the forest is a resource. The nearly 30 million people living in the Amazon region, and across Brazil, need and want to make a living. Brazil is pushing the idea of building a prospering economy by sustainably using natural resources, preserving nature to protect the vitality of the land, and developing valuable products including fuels, pharmaceuticals, and foods. Building this ""bio-economy"" features strongly in its national climate action plan. Sarah Sampaio runs a small coffee company that grows coffee beans in the shadow of trees, using a method called agroforesty - or agriculture that helps cultivate forests. She works with around 200 farming families in the Apui region, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation. ""We plant native Amazonian trees and the coffee together. The trees shade the coffee plants and farmers can also grow their own food around those plants,"" she says. ""When the coffee plant dies, the trees remain as the forest, so it's helping to restore the Amazon."" The fresh brew I'm given has a light, fruity taste, and she's proud that three of her coffees were selected among the 30 best in Brazil in the national Coffee of the Year competition. ""If we want to stop more trees from being chopped down, we have to provide people with an alternative income, a sustainable way of living,"" Sarah says. Whatever the next Amazonian superfood is, it will need to challenge açaí. The purple berry is grown and eaten in huge quantities in northern Brazil and sold for nearly £10 ($13) per smoothie bowl in parts of London. Damien Benoit sells açaí ice cream in Europe. ""It's very high in antioxidants, in fibres and unsaturated fatty acids, and in different minerals that make it very popular among people who do sports,"" he says. He works with families who keeps four hectares of açai plants in the forest ""with a minimum number of species per hectare that must be monitored."" ""We make sure children go to school, and gender equality is a huge topic for us,"" he claims. On their own, these small companies cannot feed millions of people and, so far, they've prospered due to grants or capital from charities and funds that invest in companies aimed at protecting nature. And there are questions around how much they can be scaled up. If açaí production was expanded into many industrial-size plantations, it could start to cause exactly the same problems that people like Damien are trying to solve. But there's a reason the word ""bioeconomy"" is plastered all over the UN climate talks. ""We need to move from a world dependent on fossil fuels - that is clear,"" says Ana Yang, Director of the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House. ""And if we don't have solutions that are bio-based, we will not be able to do that,"" she says. This is by no means a magic bullet solution to the problem of how to replace fossil fuels with clean energy and use the land in a way that protects nature. Brazil has also promised a four-fold increase in the use of biofuels, which can be controversial, by 2035. Biofuels such as ethanol are often touted as a replacement for fossil fuels, but they can lead to deforestation as demand increases for the crop to burn to make the fuel. Some are concerned this will lead to the unsustainable extraction of timber or sugarcane to export abroad and burn, and the theft of indigenous peoples' land. Ms Yang says it's essential to put safeguards like strong regulation in place. ""Not all bio-based transitions are good,"" she says. ""If they lead to destruction of natural habitat or they don't have good social practices, then it isn't solving the original problem.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27z4pvlz1o

Keepers at the Cornish Birds of Prey Centre CIC said a gyr falcon and a striated caracara were taken between 17:00 GMT on Thursday and 07:00 on Friday. The gyr falcon, also known as Arizona, was found at the side of the road opposite the layby at Winnards Perch, Cornwall, on Saturday. Kelly Grigg, the owner of the centre at Winnard's Perch, said the bolt and padlock to one of its aviaries had been ""hit with force"".

2025-11-16,"Nature is not a blocker to housing growth, MPs find",science,BBC,"Nature is not a blocker to housing growth and the government risks missing both its housing and nature targets if it views it as one, a cross-party group of MPs has warned in a new report. The Planning and Infrastructure Bill overrides existing habitat protections, which the government has suggested is a barrier to its target to build 1.5 million houses by the end of this parliament. But in a report published on Sunday, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) found the measures outlined in the bill are not enough to allow the government to meet its goals. ""Using nature as a scapegoat means that the government will be less effective at tackling some of the genuine challenges facing the planning system,"" the report said. A Ministry of Housing spokesperson said it was fixing a failing system with landmark reforms, which would deliver a win-win for the economy and the environment. The Labour government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 as part of efforts to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth. Under its housing reforms, it wants to simplify the planning system to speed up house-building on smaller sites by If passed, the draft legislation, which is currently making its way through the final stages in parliament, would instead allow developers to make general environmental improvements and pay into a nature restoration fund that improves habitats on other sites. But the EAC has argued that nature is not a ""blocker"" to delivering housing - it is a necessity for building resilient neighbourhoods. The EAC urged the government to instead focus on addressing a skills shortage in ecology, planning and construction. ""The government must not veer down the path of viewing nature as an inconvenience or blocker to housebuilding,"" the report said. ""In most cases, housing delivery is delayed or challenged due to unclear and conflicting policies, land banking and skills shortages."" The EAC suggested offering people better incentives to build and live in ""carbon-friendly homes"", or to retrofit existing ones. It outlined a series of recommendations aimed at boosting manufacturing viability of green construction products and alter the tax burden to support eco-friendly homes. Environmental group Friends of the Earth said the government needed to set the right priorities. Paul De Zylva, nature campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: ""This report shows that the Planning & Infrastructure Bill is bad legislation that neither provides the quality homes people need nor truly protects our already depleted nature. ""Instead of attacking newts, bats and our nature laws to justify its growth-at-any-cost agenda, the government would be better focusing on delivering against its legal targets for nature which are at risk of being missed."" A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government said: ""The Government inherited a failing system that delayed new homes and infrastructure while doing nothing for nature's recovery. ""We are fixing this with landmark reforms, including the Nature Restoration Fund, that will create a win-win for the economy and the environment.

Nutrient neutrality aims to ensure nutrient levels in rivers, already high because of sewage effluent and run-off from farmland, do not increase further.

The effects of nutrients would be neutralised through schemes such as retrofitting better water flow systems in council housing stock, improving wastewater treatment, creating buffer strips by wetland habitats and encouraging farmers to plant winter crops on land that would otherwise be left bare. The joint venture company will work with planning authorities to identify proposed developments that have stalled because they do not currently have nutrient neutrality credits. It is hoped many of those plans which have been held up, including affordable housing, could quickly be unlocked. In 2020 Natural England expressed concern about the effect these chemicals was having on the Stodmarsh Nature Reserve. Kent Wildlife Trust says: ""We believe that and protect wildlife in the Stour River catchment area. ""Our nutrient mitigation scheme is more cost effective, easier to implement and will provide mitigation with no lag time. ""To mitigate the current effects of high nitrogen and phosphorous levels on the River Stour, we're keen to use our in-house natural capital expertise to deliver Nature-based Solutions.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dnjkjzzm0o
2025-11-16,Bumper year for breeding wader birds on Upper Lough Erne,science,BBC,"Breeding waders have had one of their best years ever on Upper Lough Erne, with lapwing successfully breeding on Inishroosk after major habitat restoration by RSPB NI. Snipe had their most successful year since 2019, with 66 pairs counted. And redshank bred for a second consecutive year on land around Upper Lough Erne after being absent for five years. The success showed the value of schemes to help farmers support threatened species, according to Seán Woods, the charity's conservation manager in the west of Northern Ireland. Under a previous support scheme, RSPB NI worked with a local farmer to clear a former conifer plantation on Inishroosk. The site was restored, with wet grass and bird-friendly habitat created. A lapwing nesting site was then discovered on the cleared field. In total 55 pairs of lapwing were recorded across the area, the second highest number since monitoring began in 2011. The charity works with up to 70 farmers on Upper and Lower Lough Erne to help them support nature. This involved lowering hedges, clearing scrub, creating wet features and cutting rush in areas a conventional tractor would be unable to reach. Mr Woods said the work the charity did with them went ""above and beyond"" agri-environment schemes, which was ""crucial in terms of how we were able to see a response to the waders in the last few years"". ""Without the farmers, these birds wouldn't exist,"" he said. Curlew, which was once prolific around the Lough, held steady on the monitored sites with nine pairs recorded. One pair hatched three chicks after a nest was successfully fenced off. It was one of two nests discovered on farmland around Upper Lough Erne. Sean Woods said it was a ""significant achievement"" for the species which is in decline. Conservation charities have called for RSPB NI Conservation Office Jonathan Pinnick said this year's breeding wader success showed the value of such schemes. ""The progress we're seeing for species like Lapwing and Snipe shows what can be achieved when conservationists and farmers work together to create space for nature. ""However, the sad fact is that nature here is in trouble, we risk losing some of our most iconic birds, but it is only with help of our farmers, and support from DAERA, like this, we can continue to turn things.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yle8e72d4o
2025-11-17,'Storm Amy knocked out power for six days - it can't happen again',science,BBC,"Residents in a remote part of the west Highlands whose power supply was cut off during Storm Amy fear they could be left in the dark again by future extreme weather events. Some households in Ardnamurchan were without power for six days when the first named storm of the season battered the country last month. The chair of West Ardnamurchan Community Council said residents felt ""abandoned"" by energy distribution firm Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN). A spokesperson for the company, which manages the power grid in the north of Scotland, said it was working with the local community to boost resilience. Villages on the Ardnamurchan peninsula, the most westerly point on the British mainland, were some of the worst impacted by the storm in early October. SSEN provided welfare vans offering hot food and facilities to villagers affected. But for those in Kilchoan, on the west side of the peninsula, , about 20 miles away on a single-track road. Rosie Curtis, chairwoman of the West Ardnamurchan Community Council, was among those affected in the village, which has a population of about 150. She said there had been a lack of communication from SSEN on when engineers would arrive to reconnect supplies. ""We felt abandoned. I know there were thousands of homes that were without power,"" she said. ""But all we needed was someone at the other end of the phone to say 'ok, Ardnamurchan, we know where you are, we'll get there as soon as we can'. ""But six days is a long time without our facilities."" Ms Curtis added: ""I know you can't predict what the weather is, and that is something we are going to have to live with, but I think, from their point of view, all we're asking for is better communication."" Anna McDonald, who owns the Eòrna Pottery studio in Kilchoan, said her business had been affected by the outage. She said work on her handmade ceramics ground to a halt until the power could be reconnected. Ms McDonald said: ""I was unable to fire the kiln, I couldn't throw anything on the wheel, both are powered by electricity. ""That's the main bulk of my work as a potter so it had a huge impact. ""If it is something that keeps happening, it definitely will affect my business."" A spokesman for SSEN said its distribution team met with residents in Ardnamurchan on Thursday to discuss how resilience could be improved. Nik Wheeler, head of SSEN's customer operations in the north of Scotland, said: ""We go through a regular sequence after a storm to see what we could do better. ""That is something we have taken from Storm Amy to say 'what can we do, where can we contact communities before events?'. ""The challenge there is that something might not happen for multiple years after it, so it's about keeping that refreshed to know where the best place to provide those facilities."" into Scotland's energy grid over the next five years earlier this week. The company said it was also taking a proactive approach to preventative measures in anticipation of future storms. Mark Beaman, performance manager of SSEN's tree cutting team, observed branches on some trees near power lines in the Glen Livet area being felled. He said: ""This kind of activity is going on year in, year out to make sure the network is as resilient as possible and will stand up to weather events to make sure power is not interrupted.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pz83kj1go

2025-11-18,Once-extinct wildcats to make a comeback in England,science,BBC,"Wildcats – one of the UK's most critically endangered mammals – could make a return from extinction in England, conservationists say. The South West Wildcat Project hopes to bring back 50 European wildcats, from 2028, after a study found a colony could ""flourish"" in the mid-Devon countryside. Reintroduction plans follow a breeding scheme to boost numbers in Scotland but there are concerns that the carnivores could pose a threat to poultry, gamebirds and native bird species, as well as a risk of cross-breeding with domestic cats. The Countryside Alliance said that if that risk was not dealt with, ambitions to sustain a genetically pure wildcat population would be ""doomed to failure"". The South West Wildlife Project – a partnership led by Devon Wildlife Trust - said independent research by the University of Exeter showed that about 80% of people asked were positive about wildcat reintroduction. But Oliver Edwards, a beef and sheep farmer on Exmoor, told the BBC he was concerned that reintroducing a predatory species would have ""a detrimental effect on the animals and bird life that live here already"". ""They say wildcats live on voles. Well, voles are feeding my barn owls so if you reduce the vole population you are having an effect on the barn owls,"" he explained. He added that there needed to be wider consultation with farmers and landowners about the best areas to reintroduce the wildcats. European wildcats – historically also known as woodcats – were once widespread in Great Britain until human persecution and the loss of woodland and rough grass habitats saw them disappear from England and Wales. Today, the UK's only remaining wildcat population lives in the Highlands of Scotland but, despite being given protected status in 1988, they are now classed as critically endangered and at risk of UK extinction, with as few as 115 remaining in the wild. Cath Jeffs, the South West Wildcat Project lead for Devon Wildlife Trust, said the team would continue to work closely with locals to deal with any concerns or issues raised over the phased reintroduction and that specific locations had yet to be decided. She pointed out that most measures taken to stop predators like foxes from targeting poultry or gamebirds would work for wildcats. She added that it was unlikely there would be a population explosion as wildcats live in low density numbers over wider areas and they would be closely monitored and managed. ""We are absolutely committed to making this happen, but in the right way and at the right time,"" she added. The south west of England has been identified as a prime site for reintroduction because of the woodland cover it offers across mid-Devon, connected by other habitats that suit wildcats. But some critics have suggested the area is more populated than parts of the Highlands where they have been reintroduced before. They said that could lead to the wildcats breeding with feral domestic cats, with such interbreeding – also known as hybridisation - undermining the whole idea of bringing back the species. Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the organisation was not opposed to ""properly planned and managed reintroduction"". But he said there were concerns about the ability to sustain a ""genetically pure"" population of wildcat because of the threat of hybridisation. ""Reintroducing wildcats in the south-west without addressing this issue would seem to be doomed to failure,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the Devon Wildlife Trust said they would tackle the threat of hybridisation by working with local welfare organisations to support a neutering programme for feral and domestic cats in areas where wildcats were introduced.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43y97k252o

Record river levels triggered severe flood warnings last weekend, as the River Monnow rose higher than during Storm Dennis in 2020 and Storm Bert in 2024. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) issued alerts warning of a ""significant risk to life"" and parts of Monmouth and nearby villages were left underwater. It said it was looking at options to manage flood risk. Former Monmouth MP David TC Davies said communities had ""lost out"" on flood defences despite repeated pleas for protection. Mr Davies said people who live by the River Monnow cannot get insurance and others ""are now going to find it very difficult to get insurance"". ""There are places around here like Skenfrith, that need a flood defence scheme,"" he said. ""The NRW agreed with that but for one reason or another it, and I don't want to do politics, but it just hasn't happened and the area has lost out."" A spokesperson for NRW said: ""We recognise that Skenfrith has experienced flooding on several occasions in recent years. ""We continue to work closely with the local community and elected members to explore what options are available to help manage flood risk. ""We have followed government processes and assessed possible options, and this has shown that the most viable and cost-beneficial approach is property-level protection. ""We have been working with the community to identify the best options for each property and we are committed to taking this project forward. ""We have also been in discussions with partner organisations about the potential for nature-based catchment solutions, and these conversations are ongoing. for donations including clothes, and local businesses have been providing food.

Mayor of Monmouth Jackie Atkin, who set up the fundraiser, said the donations has been ""incredible"", adding their immediate priority is to clean up. ""The money came thick and fast... it's just incredible, so we'll be working out how and where to distribute those funds effectively to businesses, residents and communities affected. ""Monmouth is not shut for business, we're definitely open."" Rachel Hollingsbee, whose nail bar Bee You, Bee Beautiful in Monmouth has been flooded, said: ""It's just a show of mud and silt. ""Every business has been covered with a thick, grimy layer which is where most of the damage has come from. It's going to sit there if we don't action it quickly."" A rain gauge in the Black Mountains on the northern edge of Monmouthshire recorded accumulations of 119.6mm between Thursday night and Saturday morning, BBC Wales environment correspondent Steffan Messenger said. It's more rain than would be expected for the whole month. The impact can be clearly seen in river level data - with flows along the Monnow reaching their highest on record. At Monnow Gate, Monmouth's famous medieval fortified river bridge - the water level had reached 6.658 metres by 2.45am on Saturday, beating the previous record set in the wake of Storm Dennis in 2020. Then local flood defences, built decades ago, had been enough to protect the town centre itself, though flooding from the river Wye affected the Mayhill area.

Sally Buckland, who runs West Sussex Falconry, said she was in a ""blind panic"" when she found his enclosure door wide open and its latch broken. She said Buddy could have kicked the door open as he sometimes tries to jump at pigeons outside. She said there was no need for people to ""lock the doors and keep their pet rabbits inside"", although she warned that Buddy was an ""opportunist"". ""There is always the potential for a bird of prey to kill something, but instinctively he's more likely to be interested if he sees any mice or rats,"" she added. Ms Buckland told the BBC finding Buddy, who she has owned for six years, was ""a needle in a haystack"" situation and his location was ""anybody's guess"". ""The only advantage with this bird is that he is rather large and he's quite conspicuous,"" she said. ""If people see him they're not just going to write it off as a tawny owl. They're going to look twice."" Ms Buckland said the ""million dollar question"" was whether Buddy, who was bred in captivity, knew how to hunt.

2025-11-18,Energy club set up to share renewable power,science,BBC,"Residents of a North Yorkshire village have formed the first renewable energy club in the region in a bid to cut their costs and carbon footprint. The Settle Energy Local Club (SELC) takes excess energy produced from solar panels on a local furniture business and passes it on to members at a discounted price. Launched in August the club currently has six consumers and one generator, but is looking to expand within the area around Settle, Giggleswick and Langcliffe. SELC secretary Paul Kelly said he hoped the club could ""play our part in de-carbonising Settle and its locality."" ""If we can reduce our carbon footprint as a town, then we're doing something positive towards addressing climate change,"" he said. The scheme in Settle works by club members buying the excess energy generated from the solar panels on top of Simon Robinson's businesses, Slow Sofa and Dalesbred, for a discounted pre-agreed price. So, when a member flicks on a kettle and Mr Robinson's business is generating surplus energy a smart meter in their home matches up the supply and demand. Sometimes it will be possible to match the demands of all the members with locally generated power but at other times the demand will outstrip the supply. If that happens the consumer's usual energy supplier will sell members the additional electricity they need at different rates depending on the time of day. Mr Robinson, who received a grant from North Yorkshire County Council to install the solar array on the roof of his showroom and workshop, said the panels could produce about 17 to 20 kilowatts on a sunny day. ""I get exactly the same price for my electric that I would if I was selling it straight back into the grid,"" he said. ""And, yet, the local community is buying it at 14p [per unit] rather than 23p,"" he said. ""I just think it's better for the local community to get that, rather than one of the big energy companies."" There are currently 14 active clubs that are part of the Energy Local initiative across Great Britain. The future ambition for SELC is that it will continue to grow, bringing new consumers and generators onboard, Mr Kelly said. ""We've been looking for other reasonably sized generators in the town, and one of the ones that are keen to help are the churches,"" he explained. ""The Catholic Church and Methodist Church in Settle have deliberately put a lot more solar panels on than they need for their own consumption in order they have surplus energy to export to the club."" Mr Robinson added that it was ""an exciting journey"" to be able to share renewable energy across the town.""

A team of scientists is hoping to plug that gap by gathering samples for analysis and training ordinary people to help build their database. The Centre for Environmental Data and Recording (CEDaR) works with National Museums NI to record information about local wildlife and the habitats they need to thrive. And as one of the events to mark their 30th anniversary, they are turning their attentions to earthworms. Samples have been gathered from Colin Glen in Belfast and it is hoped they will give an insight into how this very important species is doing in Northern Ireland. in the latest review, meaning they need help. Niamh Carmichael from CEDaR said the species is ""a really important group"" for conservation in general. ""They're brilliant decomposers, they're also food for a number of other species. ""They're basically the foundation for most of our ecosystems. ""And if we don't protect those wee guys then we're gonna lose everything else."" Information on earthworms is relatively scarce across the UK, with Northern Ireland having even less data available, according to Keiron Brown, a senior naturalist with the Biological Recording Company and a volunteer for the Earthworm Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ""What we don't know about earthworms in Northern Ireland includes exactly what species we've got. ""In addition to that, we don't know how many we've got and we don't know how well distributed different species are."" And that, he added, leaves scientists like him with more questions than answers. ""Have we got species of earthworm that are restricted to certain parts of Northern Ireland?  Are most of the species spread everywhere? ""And that means we can't even begin to think about things like conserving earthworms or managing sites and habitats for earthworms if we don't have that information."" Like most of our biodiversity, everything from climate change to loss of habitat may be affecting earthworms. But they are also at risk from an invasive species that arrived in Northern Ireland more than 60 years ago. The first sighting of the New Zealand flatworm was here in 1963. ""Lots of things eat earthworms, but this is the only predator that can follow an earthworm down its burrow,"" said Keiron. ""So theoretically these could really impact our earthworm populations."" ""With ""little monitoring"" of the invasive species, he appealed to anyone finding what they think might be a New Zealand flatworm to take a picture and upload the sighting to a Ordinary people are playing a growing part in building reliable data. As a senior curator of Natural History at National Museums NI, Helen James is keen to use the samples she collects at the Ulster Museum to benefit all sorts of research. The adult worms that are gathered are used to help train people to identify species before becoming part of the museum collection. ""We can also use them to look at DNA studies so to see if the species that we're finding here are the same as the ones that occur in mainland Britain for example,"" she said. ""It's just a really important part of understanding our ecosystem of Northern Ireland."" Earthworms perform a number of functions that ultimately benefit us. In fact, analysis by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute found they provided £83m worth of environment services when looked at in terms of the value of grass growth. Keiron Brown said they do more than help out farmers and gardeners. ""It's not just about breaking down the soil, which we all know. ""With their burrowing they create aeration into the soil, they allow for drainage, they fix nutrients into forms that are available for plants to take up.

Chief executive Tony Booth, 43, from Coventry, said: ""Our aim is to  have a Midlands-based technology centre and centre of excellence, where our first factory will be built... and [that] will become a blueprint. Mr Booth started the business after identifying a gap in the expanding green economy to support businesses with waste and recycling challenges. Since 2018, he has been investing in the development of processes to strip batteries, repurpose and then recertify the components to sell back into the industry. ""The factory will enable us to be able to show customers, and also the industry, what we're about and what we can do."" ""We're seeing a lot of materials coming through to us where a car has had something go wrong with it and it's ended up having to be written off because there's no where to fix it."" Having grown up in Coventry and attended the city's President Kennedy School,  Mr Booth said it was important to him to employ people from the region. ""It's a big passion of mine, I really want to make sure we give jobs back to the local area. 'We're doing a recruitment drive locally because we actually want to make sure that [people] feel like they can come and work at an engineering company like this, without having all of the skills.

2025-11-19,Student raises funds for Jamaican hurricane victims,science,BBC,"A student is raising money to help relief efforts in Jamaica after Hurricane Melissa devastated his grandmother's home nation. Concerned for friends and family, Tyrell-Jordan Blackwood, from Dartford, began collecting essential aid items after The 26-year-old North Kent College student said he was hoping to raise £4,000 to pay for a shipping container to deliver the goods to charities in Jamaica. Mr Blackwood said: ""I started the campaign because I saw Jamaica needed to be rebuilt, needed relief and needed hope."" The media student, who is also a DJ and content producer, received donations from followers to his social media channels and used his mobile events van to collect them. But as food, tools, sanitary products, tarpaulin and clothing kept coming in, Mr Blackwood decided he needed a way to get the items to Jamaica. ""I don't have that kind of money so I put an appeal out,"" he said. The campaign has raised more than £1,300 so far towards the shipping container costs, which will be overseen by registered charities Chelsea Big Local and the Jamaican Red Cross. Melissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean. At its peak, it had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph. The hurricane caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, with Homes were destroyed, while roads became flooded or blocked by debris, isolating communities with little food, no power and no running water. Mr Blackwood eventually made contact with his loved ones when communication was restored, but he was shocked at the scale of destruction. He said: ""Houses are flattened, there's no water, there's no roofs. Entire homes have caved in. ""In some homes in the countryside, there is no electric, people are left with no belongings. ""People that did have food have had it go off because there's no electric. ""My aunt has been told it will be like that for months."" North Kent College, in Dartford, is planning to support the fundraising campaign by hosting a music event where Mr Blackwood will perform under his stage name DJ Stylah. His tutor and head of media at the college, Grahame Gladin, said everyone was impressed by his motivation. He said: ""He's a real star. He brought such energy to this campaign and the college is fully behind him.  It's so important that we get involved and start helping. ""The Jamaican people are left in devastation at the moment, so it's important we get on that journey, and TJ is the perfect man for the job.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4k420k9po
2025-11-18,Anger as washed-up pellet pollution reaches Kent,science,BBC,"People who enjoy walking along the south-eastern coastline have hit out at a water firm after pollution caused by the release of millions of plastic pellets appears to have spread. Local residents - and former pop star Feargal Sharkey - criticised Southern Water after beads that initially in East Sussex earlier this month washed up on the coast of Kent. Southern Water said it was ""so sorry"" after previously admitting it was ""highly likely"" that the  pellets escaped due to Pedro Cayuela, from Littlestone, Kent, told the BBC: ""I won't be taking my dog for a walk along the shoreline whilst there is a warning about the beads. ""Southern Water should take greater care of our environment, like water companies do in other countries."" Peter Crome, from Camber, said: ""I'm worried about what tourists will think."" Sharkey, who is now a clean water campaigner, branded Southern Water's clean up ""a sham"" in a post on social media. He said he had been told by local people that the pollution stretches along the coast as far as Dungeness, in Kent, a distance of over 10 miles. He added: ""They also tell me the plastic beads are... threatening the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve, home to over 4,200 species of plants and animals."" Folkestone and Hythe MP Tony Vaughan said pellets were turning up in St Mary's Bay, in Kent. He said: ""Southern Water - you need to get down here and clean up your mess."" Kent County Council's cabinet member for the environment, David Wimble, said: ""The biggest problem is the fact that the wildlife is swallowing the beads, dogs are even swallowing them as they go for their morning walks on the beach."" Southern Water, he said, had ""owned"" the problem. ""It's what they do next with the clean-up operation (which) is the most important thing."" he added. Hastings and Rye MP Helena Dollimore said she was told by Southern Water that about 312 milllion beads had been released. Southern Water said it was working with Sussex Wildlife Trust, the Environment Agency and others to stop more beads getting into Rye harbour or saltmarsh, and to find the best way recover beads in the sea. It added: ""We now know substantially fewer beads - less than 10 tonnes - entered the sea, than was initially feared. ""Teams are daily walking over beaches on a 40-mile stretch of the coast from Eastbourne to St Mary's Bay, but our forecasts suggest the beads have dispersed widely and are in very low concentrations."" Small amounts had been found and removed from other beaches, the firm said. ""Our response to this incident will need to be sustained and long term."" it added. The Environment Agency said: ""We acknowledge that Southern Water has admitted responsibility for the pollution incident at Camber Sands. ""This is an active investigation and we will not hesitate to take robust enforcement action where appropriate.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24levjvm6mo
2025-11-18,NHS Grampian could drill deep into ground for heat,science,BBC,"NHS Grampian is looking into whether it should drill deep underground in Aberdeen to source heat from granite. project could ultimately mean drilling a borehole to a depth of 1.5 miles (2.5km). It follows a feasibility study aimed at finding a way of cutting the health board's heating bills, and NHS Grampian is now looking into funding options. Deep geothermal technology works by pumping cold water deep underground, where it is warmed by the earth before then coming back hot enough to be used to help heat buildings. It is most commonly used in volcanic countries such as Iceland, but also in the A 3.1 mile (5km) well on the Cornwall site started to generate heat in June 2023 and started to supply heat as the weather became colder. NHS Grampian said there was also ""immense potential"" for drilling for geothermal heat underground in Aberdeen. You'll have seen the postcard images of Icelandic geysers projecting bursts of hot water high into the air. That water is heated by the hot volcanic rock close to the surface and is responsible for heating 90% of the country's homes. We obviously don't have geysers in Scotland but in the north east we do have granite, both below the ground and in the fabric of the city's buildings. That unseen granite is ideal for holding and conducting the deep earth's colossal heat. Like with the naturally occurring geysers in Iceland, that heat is best brought to the surface in the water and so digging deep will create that constant flow of hot fluid that effectively fills up the radiators. At a million pounds a kilometre, it's an expensive hole. But once the infrastructure is completed, the costs of producing that heat would be relatively cheap and genuinely renewable. The feasibility study was completed by TownRock Energy in partnership with the health board. It concluded that a geothermal solution could supply significant quantities of renewable heat for NHS Grampian's main Foresterhill Health Campus in Aberdeen. The next phase of the project would mean proving the viability of the technology proposed in the feasibility study. It is estimated drilling the borehole would cost at least £2.45m. NHS Grampian said the process used similar skills and technology to those used in the North Sea oil and gas industry. NHS Grampian's energy manager Michael Black said the energy bill for the Foresterhill Health Campus alone was about £1m a month. He said that cost estimates compared to gas made a ""strong"" case for exploring the geothermal option further. ""But there is a huge amount of work to do with partners to look at the options on the table and explore potential funding sources,"" Mr Black added. NHS Grampian is also exploring a larger project with the city's two universities looking at the potential to heat local homes. TownRock Energy chief executive David Townsend said: ""The feasibility study enabled us to look in detail at how deep geothermal wells would have to be drilled to achieve the temperature and heat generating capacity we'd need for NHS Grampian, and start to build a business case for further development. ""The findings are promising so far, and an exploration drilling phase would prove the commercial viability of the system and determine how best to design and build it."" He said that, with the right design, a geothermal system could produce enough heat not just for the Foresterhill campus but for other people in Aberdeen relying on gas. ""When people hear the word geothermal, they often think about areas like Iceland,"" Mr Townsend said. ""But recent advances in engineering mean that lower temperature resources in geologically stable regions like Aberdeen are now viable.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07m4pvde5yo

National Grid said the construction of Weston Marsh substations A and B, near Spalding, was ""vital"" for the future of the UK's energy supply. The proposals are part of the 87-mile (140km) Grimsby to Walpole pylon plan, which has drawn objections from Lincolnshire County Council and communities along the route. Jenny Pennington, who lives close to the proposed substation site, said she was concerned about what her family could soon be living near to and that it was ""not good news for the area"". She said: ""We're not sure of the size of the substations yet. Obviously, we'll have to wait and see. ""I won't say it's a shock because we knew it was coming but it's not good news for the area, it's going to make Weston [Marsh] a very industrial area.""

The 15 vehicles have been off the road for over a year following problems with fuelling stations. The buses, which are owned by Aberdeen City Council (ACC), but operated by First Bus on its city network, have been out of action since September last year, after technical problems at the city's two fuelling stations, at Kittybrewster and Cove. It was hoped they would return in the summer but the local authority does not yet know on what date they will be able to take passengers again. In April, ACC said that while the buses were being refurbished, it hoped new mobile fuelling facilities at Kittybrewster and the First Bus King Street depot would allow the buses to return in the summer.

2025-11-19,Animal welfare 'priority' in wake of vet changes,science,BBC,"The welfare of the Isle of Man's livestock is the ""immediate priority"" in the wake of potential disruption to veterinary services for farmers, the Manx parliament has been told. It follows major key provider Milan Veterinary Practice announcing its intention to stop offering the services - leading to much concern from farm staff about a potential mass shortage of care. Although the concerns led to the chain agreeing to continue its services, it was only on an , with a review due in the new year. Environment, Food and Agriculture Minister Clare Barber said the government was now working with the industry to understand its veterinary needs and how they could be met in future. She said discussions were also underway with the Enterprise Department over potential support schemes to help new and existing practices expand into farm work, or increase capacity. Milan's parent firm IVC Evidensia had previous notified its customers of its from the island's farming market on 30 November, stating it was ""no longer sustainable"". In a letter to the firm following that initial announcement last week, the Manx National Farmers' Union warned the removal of services at short notice would put ""animal welfare at very high risk"". A lack of capacity at other practices to take on Milan's clients meant the local dairy and meat trade and all island exports risked ""catastrophic failure"" as farms not registered with a vet would ""not be able to remain as Red Tractor assured"", the union said. The situation would also see disease management and prevention ""suffer significantly"", it added. Barber told Tynwald members the island's chief vet had hosted a meeting for all veterinary practices on the island on Monday evening to ""understand any barriers"" and ""explore potential solutions"". It was ""clear"" there was ""a strong desire and commitment from the veterinary community to find those long-term sustainable solutions and explore opportunities for collaboration"", she continued. ""The chief veterinary officer has been clear that the immediate priority is maintaining animal welfare and ensuring farmers continue to have access to veterinary care for their livestock,"" she told politicians. The minister said while the temporary reprieve ""gives us a little more time"", it was ""clear that alternative arrangements need to be found as quickly as possible"". Without access to the services ""it would be almost impossible for people to continue farming"", she said, and her department had engaged with the union to ""develop a survey to better understand the needs and requirements of farmers"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge535zlj93o
2025-11-20,The pioneering dairy farmer keeping calves with their mothers,science,BBC,"At most, traditional dairy farms calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of their birth. It allows farmers to collect the milk that the calves would naturally drink and sell it to be made into dairy products. But one farmer in the south of Scotland is pioneering an unconventional method of commercial dairy farming - keeping cow and calf together for about six months. David Finlay, who farms 130 dairy cows near Gatehouse of Fleet, claims the system results in higher animal welfare standards and a more profitable business. Now he is calling for the Scottish government to fund a radical new cow-with-calf development programme. However, some farmers believe Mr Finlay's system is not viable for many in the industry. Mr Finlay and his late wife Wilma decided to explore the cow-with-calf dairy system at Rainton Farm in 2012. Mrs Finlay, who did not come from a dairy farming background, could not understand why the mothers and newborns were separated. The unconventional new method had only been trialled on small-scale farms in places like the Netherlands. Mr Finlay said: ""Basically, it's leaving the calves with their own mothers instead of for less than a few hours, it's now leaving them for five to six months. ""And we're trying to see if we can harness the natural health and productivity of a system where it is more natural for the cows and calves."" The Finlays implemented the cow-with-calf system with their herd, but the decision almost bankrupted the business when they did not have enough milk left to sell to market. After overhauling their business plan and adopting a new approach, the couple found a way of making the system financially viable. David claims that among the benefits are happier cows and staff, healthier animals and an increase in life-expectancy. ""What we've found is we can carry 25% more cows on the farm, because the young stock are growing and maturing so much faster and the cows are yielding 25% more milk,"" he said. ""So even with the calves drinking a third of their mother's milk, the system is actually more efficient, more productive and more profitable."" The calves do not take all their mother's milk, so cows can still provide milk for market while they are with their young. Rainton Farm is now the largest commercial cow-with-calf dairy farm in Europe. Mr Finlay is asking the Scottish government for a multi-million pound funding commitment, to match the EU's research on system economics, environmental and animal welfare impacts. Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie said the government is committed to high animal welfare standards and has previously committed to trialling cow-with-calf research projects. ""I will always encourage those in the sector to look for innovative approaches to farming that push Scotland to be a global leader in sustainable and regenerative agriculture,"" he said. ""For this reason the adoption and use of sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices is one of the key objectives of the Agriculture and Rural Communities (Scotland) Act 2024 and it is great to see progressive businesses taking the initiative and adopting these practices already."" Dairy farming is big business in south-west Scotland, with Dumfries and Galloway home to almost half of Scotland's dairy herds. However, the Finlays have their fair share of sceptics and critics. David McMiken, a third generation dairy farmer who runs 300 cows on his farm at Ernespie near Castle Douglas, said he would welcome more investment into the dairy industry as a whole but the cow-with-calf system was unlikely to be widely adopted. ""Ultimately this system is a more expensive way to produce milk,"" he said. ""It comes with increased labour costs, increased feed costs, and unfortunately that's not viable in a lot of farms. ""Using a conventional set-up, we also have independent disease control between the mothers and calves. ""Scotland has some of the highest welfare regulations in the world and we're very proud of the sector that we've built."" Mr McMiken said it could be argued that separating cows and their calves after five to six months could be even more stressful for the animals, as they have had time to developed a maternal bond. Mr Finlay was recently awarded an Honorary Fellowship by Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), for his commitment to innovation, sustainability and education. The college is part of an EU's Transform Dairy Net project, which is bringing together 26 partners and 11 farmer-led innovation hubs to study cow-with-calf systems. Dr Holly Ferguson, a precision dairying scientist with SRUC, said: ""People are beginning to question more whether it's a system they could run and are getting a bit more interested in the challenges and the pitfalls. ""People like David pioneering this system and helping farmers understand what works and what doesn't are really useful and it's what we need - more people to create that blueprint that would let people take up cow-with-calf systems in the UK."" The Finlay's journey from traditional dairy farming to pioneers of this radical new system has been captured on film and made into the award-winning documentary A Dairy Story by Dumfries filmmaker Ian Findlay. The film has been made more poignant as Mrs Finlay died with cancer in March 2025. Mr Finlay said he struggles with the fact that his wife is not around to see the success of the documentary, or the continued success of the system she helped to develop. He said: ""It's tragic. It's such a shame. But the fact that we have a viable system that works as a business and we have found a way to farm that is better for our animals and our staff is testament to Wilma.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly452540dzo

2025-11-20,Turkey set to host COP31 after reaching compromise with Australia,science,BBC,"The COP31 climate meeting is now expected to be held in Turkey after Australia dropped its bid to host the annual event. Under the UN rules, the right to host the COP in 2026 falls to a group of countries made up of Western Europe, Australia and others. A consensus must be reached but neither country had been willing to concede. Australia has now agreed to support the Turkish bid in return for their minister chairing the talks following negotiations at COP30, currently being held in Brazil. This unusual arrangement has taken observers by surprise. It is normal for a COP president to be from the host country and how this new partnership will work in practice remains to be seen. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called the compromise with Turkey an ""outstanding result"" in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), noting Pacific issues would be ""front and centre"". He added that he had spoken to Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape and Prime Minister Rabuka of Fiji. However, Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency ""we are all not happy. And disappointed it's ended up like this"". Solomon Islands leader Jeremiah Manele earlier told the ABC he would be ""disappointed"" if Australia didn't secure the event. Despite this, there will be relief among countries currently meeting at COP30 in the Brazilian city of Belém that a compromise has been reached as the lack of agreement on the venue was becoming an embarrassment for the UN. Australia has pushed hard to have the climate summit in the city of Adelaide, arguing that they would co-host the meeting with Pacific island states who are seen as among the most vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels. Turkey, which has proposed hosting COP31 in the city of Antalya, felt that they had a good claim to be the host country as they had stood aside in 2021 and allowed the UK to hold the meeting in Glasgow. If neither country was willing to compromise then the meeting would have been held in the German city of Bonn, the headquarters of the UN's climate body. As a result of discussions at COP30, a compromise appears to have been reached. This includes pre-COP meeting will be held on a Pacific island, while the main event is held in Turkey. Australia's climate minister Chris Bowen will be its president. ""Obviously, it would be great if Australia could have it all, but we can't have it all,"" Mr Bowen told reporters outside the Australian delegation offices here in Belém. ""This process works on consensus, and consensus means if someone objected to our bid, it would go to Bonn."" ""That would mean 12 months with a lack of leadership, no COP president in place, no plan, that would be irresponsible for multilateralism in this challenging environment."" Mr Bowen believes having a COP president not from the host country will work and that he will have the considerable authority reserved for the president of these gatherings. ""As COP president of negotiations, I would have all the powers of the COP presidency to manage, to handle the negotiations, to appoint co-facilitators, to prepare draft text, to issue the cover decision,"" he said. He also confirmed to the BBC that Turkey will also appoint a president who will run the venue, organise the meetings and schedules. Australia's climbdown will be embarrassing for the government of Mr Albanese, after lobbying long and hard to win support among the other nations in the Western Europe group. The compromise will have to be ratified by more than 190 countries gathered here for COP30. Given the difficulties in getting to this compromise, there are unlikely to be any objections.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx242yj380no

The Countryside Regeneration Trust, which owns three farms in Surrey, wants to raise £6,000 for equipment to monitor populations of dormice in the county. Conservationists believe dormouse populations have crashed by 70% in the last 25 years, becoming extinct in 14 counties, due to habitat loss. The trust wants to use 250 footprint monitoring tunnels to track their movements at sites in Farnham and Frensham in Surrey, as well as farms in Herefordshire and Dorset. The footprint tunnels will help to track the movements and numbers of the tiny elusive creatures, without any need to disturb them. Tunnels placed on a nature reserve in Lindfield, West Sussex, recently Trust conservation officer Ruth Moss said: ""Hazel dormice are considered bioindicators because they are sensitive to habitat and population fragmentation. ""When they are present, there will also be lots of other sensitive species from bats and butterflies to birds and amphibians as their habitat is suitable for a host of different species.

It is not yet known what caused the blaze. The talks were in the final hours of trying to agree on next steps to tackle climate change but the fire has disrupted negotiations and the talks remain closed. ""It was climbing the walls and onto the ceiling. People were screaming,"" Dr Harshita Umesh, who was giving a talk next to the place where they fire broke out, told BBC News. ""Then I ran, I think I tripped and fell."" Dr Umesh, who is a medical doctor, said that ambulance staff told her that first responders inhaled ""toxic fumes"" and were given oxygen masks to the site. Emergency medicine specialist Kimberly Humphrey, currently helping patients at the COP medical centre, told the BBC that the injuries are ""Mainly people with smoke inhalation, someone with a lung injury from smoke."" ""People are pretty traumatised and shocked,"" she added. ""There's a huge panic, people have been running out of here, it's a very dramatic moment...

""You can see huge columns of smoke rising up into the air through the hole that's been burnt in the top of the conference centre,"" he said. BBC journalists saw two ambulances driving towards the entrance more than 90 minutes after the fire started. A Brazilian security officer putting a chain through the gates of the venue told the BBC the premises must be evacuated and locked. After the fire broke out, orange flames burned a hole through the sheeting that covers the venue, which is in a former aerodrome. One video shows a man spraying a fire extinguisher at the fire before running away. One eyewitness told the BBC that he believes an electrical fire was the cause. A woman was taken away in a wheelchair, but it is not clear if that was connected to the fire. Hundreds of people were left sitting on the floor or on plastic chairs outside in high temperatures and humidity. The fire is likely to delay the closing of a deal in the talks. A number of country delegations were forced to take shelter outside under the roof of a petrol station, a member of the UK delegation told the BBC. He said the fire halted negotiations.

2025-11-22,Charity calls for winter hedge-planting volunteers,science,BBC,"A countryside charity is calling for people to help it plant hedgerows as part of a project aiming to care for the rural environment. CPRE Shropshire is now in the fifth year of its Hedgerow Heroes scheme. The organisation is aiming to plant more than 4km (2.5 miles) of new native hedgerow in the county this winter. As well as providing shelter for livestock and helping with flooding issues, the charity said hedgerows could provide wildlife corridors and a ""bounty of blossom, berries and nuts"" for insects, birds and small mammals. The charity is seeking volunteers to help plant at a number of sites around Shropshire between early December and late February. ""Hedge planting is a really great activity to do in the winter time,"" said project manager Sarah Jameson. ""It gets you out into the countryside doing something helpful for nature and meeting like-minded people."" She added: ""Hot drinks and cake are also arranged!"" People who have not planted a tree or a hedge before are welcome -  with help on hand and tools provided.

2025-11-21,At least 41 dead as relentless rains flood Vietnam,science,BBC,"Relentless rains and floods have killed at least 41 people in central Vietnam since the weekend, while a search continues for nine still missing, state media reports. The deluge has submerged more than 52,000 homes and left half a million households and businesses without power, according to reports. Tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated from the flood-affected regions. Rainfall has exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas over the past three days, even rising beyond the 1993 flood peak of 5.2m in some parts. Extreme weather has battered Vietnam in recent months. Two typhoons, , left a trail of death and destruction within weeks of each other. Natural disasters in Vietnam have wreaked damage amounting to $2bn (£1.5bn) between January and October this year, according to government estimates. The areas worst-hit by the latest rainfall include the coastal cities of Hoi An and Nha Trang, as well as a key coffee production belt in the central highlands - where farmers are already reeling from a stalled harvest because of the earlier storms. In the province of Dak Lak, the country's biggest coffee growing region, tens of thousands of homes were submerged, according to state news outlet Tuoi Tre. Vietnam is one of the largest exporters of robusta, the bitter tasting bean used in instant coffee and some espresso blends. Weather conditions in the region are set to last until at least Sunday, according to authorities. Military troops and police officers have been deployed to set up emergency shelters and to relocate people to safety. The province has declared a state of emergency after landslides damaged major roads and highways. Traffic was completely halted after part of the Mimosa Pass, a key entry route into the popular tourist city of Da Lat, collapsed into a ravine, while a bus narrowly avoided falling into the gap, news agency AFP reported. Photographs published by local media show people stranded on roofs as floodwaters fill their homes, while a video circulating online shows a suspension bridge in Lam Dong province getting torn off its anchors. A restaurant owner in Nha Trang told AFP that his shops were submerged by about a metre of water. ""I am worried about our furniture in my restaurants and shops, but of course I cannot do anything now,"" said Bui Quoc Vinh. ""I don't think the water is going to recede soon, as the rain has not stopped."" Earlier in November, Typhoon Kalmaegi killed at least five people in Vietnam's central coast, uprooting trees, tearing off roofs and smashing windows. Many in Dak Lak province said their homes had collapsed or flooded. The same typhoon had killed 188 people in the Filipino island of Cebu, before making its way to Vietnam. And in September, at least 11 people died after Typhoon Bualoi hit the centre and north of Vietnam. The typhoon had packed winds of 117km/h (73mph) when it made landfall in central Vietnam. Experts say climate change has exacerbated extreme weather, with typhoons becoming stronger and more frequent.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq0q3e2j17o
2025-11-21,Flood-hit villagers urged to think before they flush,science,BBC,"A woman whose home was badly flooded after heavy rain in a village has urged people to be mindful of what they flush down the toilet. George Dryden's home was badly affected back in January during heavy rain which caused flooding in Great Glen, Leicestershire. She is now part of a flood action group which aims to educate people about what they can do to prevent damage to their homes. The group challenged pupils at the local school to come up with ideas for a poster  on the issue, which was won by five-year-old Myla. Children at St Cuthbert's CofE Primary School, who took part in the competition, learned about , which are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste, and how they could block the drains. Some of the finalists told the BBC the easiest way to remember what is safe to flush down the toilet is to think of it as ""the three Ps"" - poo, pee, and paper. ""We knew that children were really good teachers, so we knew they were going to go home and reinforce the message to their parents, which they have already been doing,"" Ms Dryden added. ""Even if what you're putting down your toilet or sink isn't going to stop the flooding, it could be the difference between [the water] in someone's house being just above the skirting board and over their knees. ""So everything that everybody can do really makes a difference."" Ms Dryden says she has not returned to her home since the flooding in January. This was due delays in repairs and her entire kitchen needing re-doing, she added. It is the second time her house has been affected, and she has also had two cars signed off. ""I do feel very nervous about moving back before January,"" she said. ""Because January has always been when it's happened, and every single time the weather is bad - and I'm not alone in this - it makes you really anxious. ""There's a website where you can look at river levels and it updates every half an hour, and I spent all of Friday afternoon on it. ""But then I thought well, actually, if it does flood what can I do? ""I've had flood barriers the first time it happened. This time with the flood, it actually went on top of them, so they were of no use to me whatsoever."" Fatbergs can ""exacerbate"" the effects of flooding, says the chairwoman of the action group Sana Shaikh. ""All the water in the village, everything in the drains, goes in the river. If there is a blockage, the water is not getting anywhere. ""So it's going to come out of a manhole.

2025-11-21,Labrador detecting hedgehogs ahead of water works,science,BBC,"A water company has enlisted the help of a Labrador to help detect and relocate wildlife in areas where it plans to work. Northumbrian Water has employed the skills of Bracken, a four-year-old dog trained to detect vulnerable species including hedgehogs and nesting birds before it conducts surveys across North East sites. Bracken, who lives with his trainer Trina Barrett in County Durham, is deployed ahead of hedgerow cutting and vegetation clearing works. Sandra Lowe, founder of charity Hope for Hedgehogs, says she hopes the animals are moved to well researched areas and provided appropriate aftercare as they are ""complex animals"". Mrs Lowe said: ""In theory it is a great idea and every council, builder, everybody, should be employing them, but what is the aftercare management, what do they do? ""Hedgehogs are best in their local environment, they know where the food and water is. ""What you should do is be moving them a minimum of two miles away so they can't go back if there is a danger. It is no good sticking them up the road."" A Northumbrian Water spokesperson said: ""The welfare of hedgehogs is really important to us. ""If we identify any, we work closely with Trina and our partners to ensure they're either carefully moved to a safe place on site or, if needed, taken to a local hedgehog charity for care. ""We also support these charities with donations for items such as bedding and flea treatments."" Ms Barrett, who holds a certificate as a Conservation Detection Dog Handler, says Bracken's skills have been developed through hands-on experience living in an area which has a healthy hedgehog population. She says Bracken ""genuinely loves what he does"" but equally enjoys being their family pet. ""His role isn't only rewarding but also vital, by helping to detect and protect vulnerable species before any work begins,"" Mrs Barrett said. ""Outside of his role, he's a much loved pet who enjoys his walks, playtime and being part of the family."" Zoe Frogbrook, from Northumbrian Water, said: ""Bracken is detecting the presence of hidden animals such as hedgehogs or nesting birds which we might not always be able to spot and, by doing so, he's supporting our efforts to make sure we don't impact the biodiversity on our sites.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrjn09zrpo

2025-11-21,'A lot of fighting': Fossil fuel row breaks out at UN climate summit,science,BBC,"A bitter row over fossil fuels has broken out at the COP30 UN climate talks in Belém, Brazil, as the meeting formally runs over time. At the heart of the row is a disagreement over how strong a deal should be on working to reduce the world's use of fossil fuels, whose emissions are by far the largest contributor to climate change. The dispute pits groups of countries against each other, but all 194 parties must agree in order to pass a deal at the two-week summit. Representatives and observers from inside a guarded negotiating room say the talks have become very difficult. One negotiator inside the room told the BBC that there ""is a lot of fighting"". The talks were meant to finish at 1800 local time (2100GMT) and will now spill into overtime. But the cruise ships that many delegations are staying on due to lack of accommodation in Belém depart the city on Saturday, piling on the pressure. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and some countries including the UK want the summit to commit nations to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuels. It would advance a deal made two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, that committed countries to ""transition away from fossil fuels"". A first draft of an agreement in Brazil offered three options including timeframes, but the latest version has no mention of fossil fuels. French Environment Minister Monique Barbut said the deal was being blocked by ""oil-producing countries - Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, but joined by many emerging countries."" She added: ""As it stands now, we have nothing left."" The BBC has approached Saudi Arabia for comment. Speaking to journalists outside the negotiating room, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said the UK was determined to keep ""alive"" at the talks a plan to take further action on fossil fuels. ""It's hard, it's sweaty, it's frustrating. There's a big divergence of views,"" he said. ""We are determined that one way or another, this innovative idea, with the support of more than 80 countries to have a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels, is kept alive at this COP,"" he said. Mr Miliband added: ""I think that in 10-20 years time people will say, ""You were the generation that saw the climate crisis around you. Did you take action? Did you rise to the challenge. It's that sense of what will people think of us in the future that keeps me going."" Some developing countries have not backed the deal on fossil fuels because they want richer nations to first deliver on promises to give climate finance to help them cope with or adapt to the effects of climate change. ""We need adaptation financing because we are already doing a lot to reduce emissions,"" Aisha Moriana, head of Pakistan's delegation, told BBC News. ""Who will pay the cheque? We are looking forward to receiving that money,"" she said. When asked if Pakistan would support the fossil fuel deal if it received new promises about finance, Ms Moriana replied: ""That is something which cannot happen in a few hours, and it requires a lot of financing."" In the hallways, groups of campaigners are chanting ""fossil fuels out"" and hanging banners saying ""Stop Amazon oil"" and ""1.5C under threat: time to act"". ""A good outcome could mean giving us a future and a present that it is worth fighting for,"" International Youth Climate Movement campaigner Shurabe Mercado, from Mexico told BBC News. ""Our generation is most at risk and we are most at stake."" The meeting is a fraught and delicate diplomatic process as countries jostle to protect their national interests, while also attempting to address the issue of climate change. Some observers question the value of the complex, legalistic talks which almost always over-run. But others point to the significant advances in measures to tackle climate change, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, and protection of nature in recent years linked to COP agreements. Other issues discussed at the COP include the gap in climate finance promised by richer nations to developing nations that are most impacted by climate change. The new draft deal called for global efforts to triple financing available to countries by 2030. But it did not say if this should come from richer nations or from other sources, like the private sector. This could anger poorer countries who want stronger support from richer nations and heavily criticised a deal at last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, which they considered paltry. Deforestation has also been been a fraught issue at the meeting which takes place on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The new draft deal weakened previous language around tackling deforestation. ""The wildlife and indigenous people who call the forest their home deserve better than this,""  said Kelly Dent, Director of External Engagement for World Animal Protection. The two-week meeting has been interrupted by two evacuations. Last week a group of protesters broke in carrying signs reading ""Our forests are not for sale"". burning a hole through the sheeting covering the venue and causing 13 smoke inhalation injuries. The summit was evacuated and closed for at least six hours. The summit has been praised for including the largest number yet of delegates from indigenous groups, but some leaders say they still have not been listened to despite being regarded the world's best guardians of biodiversity. to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

2025-11-22,What was agreed on climate change at COP30 in Brazil?,science,BBC,"Countries have reached a new deal to tackle climate change at the annual UN meeting in Belém, Brazil. , with no new measures on fossil fuels or deforestation. COP30 was the 30th annual UN climate meeting. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". ""Parties"" refers to the nearly 200 countries that have signed up to the original UN climate agreement of 1992. COP30 was due to run from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. But the talks overran into Saturday 22 November. World leaders gathered on Thursday 6 and Friday 7 November, before the conference began. The host nation is chosen by participating countries after a nomination from the host region. The conference was held in Brazil for the first time. The choice of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, caused significant challenges. Some delegations struggled to book affordable accommodation, leading to concerns that poorer nations could be priced out. to build a road for the summit also proved controversial. which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among those to attend the leaders' summit. UN secretary general António Guterres and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also there. The Prince of Wales, attending on behalf of King Charles, gave a speech calling for countries to come together to tackle the ""fast-approaching"" threats of future climate change. But many leaders were absent, including China's President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. China and the US are the two biggest emitters of planet-warming gases. Delegations from more than 190 countries, including a large number from China, attended the talks, however. The US government did not send any national officials, although some local and state leaders did attend. Politicians and diplomats were joined by scientists, campaigners and journalists. Previous summits have been criticised for the large number of attendees who are connected to the coal, oil and gas industries. Campaigners argue this shows COP30 took place at a time when global climate targets were under significant strain. In Paris in 2015, nearly 200 countries to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels and to keep them ""well below"" 2C. There is very strong scientific evidence that the impacts of climate change - from extreme heat to sea-level rise - would be far greater at 2C than at 1.5C. But while the use of renewable energy - particularly solar power - is , countries' climate plans have fallen short of what the 1.5C goal requires. Ahead of COP30, countries were supposed to have submitted updated plans detailing how they would cut their emissions of planet-warming gases. However, had done so by the end of October. UN secretary general António Guterres warned that ""overshooting"" 1.5C is inevitable, given how close the target is and how high emissions remain. But he said he hoped temperatures could still be brought back down to the target by the end of the century. Brazil hoped to agree steps to deliver commitments made at previous COPs. At COP28, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2023, about the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"". Brazil wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would achieve this. The idea of such a ""roadmap"" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but was strongly opposed by others, including those reliant on fossil fuels. In the end, the deal mentioned that existing UAE agreement - but did not strengthen the language around moving away from fossil fuels. Brazil announced its own plan to launch a fossil fuel ""roadmap"" which countries could sign up to - but it sits outside the main deal. At COP29, richer countries committed to give developing nations to help them tackle climate change. But that is far less than poorer countries say they need. That agreement also included an aspiration to raise this to $1.3tn from public and private sources. Ahead of COP30, Brazil published a ""roadmap"" detailing how the $1.3tn goal could be achieved. The COP30 deal called for a trebling of money to help the worst affected nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change, by 2035. But it's not clear how much will come from public versus private sources. And richer nations have consistently undelivered on their cash promises. At the leaders' summit ahead of COP30, Brazil launched the ""Tropical Forests Forever Facility"" - a fund which hopes to raise $125bn (£96bn) from loans and investments. The aim is to try to prevent the loss of tropical forests by rewarding countries who keep their forests standing. But the UK said it would not be committing public money - though could do so in the future and would encourage the private sector to invest. Brazil announced plans to launch a roadmap outlining steps to meet the pledge to halt and reverse deforestation, which was made in COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. But, like fossil fuels, this deforestation roadmap did not make it into the final deal. UN climate talks rely on consensus - all countries present have to agree in order to pass a deal. That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change. The backdrop for the talks this year was dominated by the fracturing consensus on tackling climate change, not least from the Trump administration. The US President has pledged to and roll back green initiatives put in place by his predecessors. Some observers, such as campaigner Greta Thunberg, have accused previous COPs of ""greenwashing"" - letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed. Significant global agreements have been reached at previous COP sessions, allowing greater progress than national measures on their own. Despite the difficulties of delivering the 1.5C warming limit, the commitment - agreed at COP21 in Paris - has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. This has helped bring down the level of anticipated warming - even though the world is still not acting at the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals. But the view from many scientists and observers is that the agreements made at COP30 are unlikely to shift the dial much on climate change. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

2025-11-23,How giant telescope spied on Soviet missile launches,science,BBC,"The secret Cold War role played by a giant radio telescope in the middle of the Cheshire countryside has been revealed. Jodrell Bank Observatory monitored Soviet missiles as nuclear tensions between the USSR and Nato powers escalated in the 1960s. David Abrutat is the official historian for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which provides top-secret intelligence to ministers and the armed forces. Archive On 4 programme that only the pioneering radio astronomer - the late Sir Bernard Lovell - and two other Jodrell Bank employees were aware of the work being done there by GCHQ staff, who were nicknamed the ""secret squirrels"" by others working at the site. Mr Abrutat said British and American intelligence bosses needed to know more about the Soviet missile programmes. ""A lot of these early space probes that were launched, the early satellites that were launched by the Soviet Union, relied on intercontinental ballistic missiles,"" he said. ""You could get an understanding of telemetry (the process of recording and transmitting instruments' readings) - the power, the capability of the missile systems being used - by monitoring a space launch. ""There was intelligence dividends from us being involved in this space programme and the work of Jodrell Bank."" He said it gave the UK ""a capability"" which is did not previously have. The Cold War-era intelligence gathering grew out of earlier pioneering work at Jodrell Bank when the radio telescope tracked Sputnik - the first unmanned satellite - when it was launched by the USSR in 1957. Jodrell Bank's founding father Sir Bernard  had been facing the sack at the time due to his radio telescope's escalating budget. But when it swung into action to track Sputnik's launch, it became indispensable. Sir Bernard recalled years later: ""I was in the laboratory where the receiving apparatus was and suddenly, before midnight, I saw the most dramatic echo. ""A huge echo - the echo of the intercontinental missile travelling over the lake to a distributed speed of 17,000 miles an hour."" He added: ""And we developed this photograph, and I projected it to a packed media, cameramen, the newspapermen, in the small lecture room. ""This wonderful echo, the only instrument in the Western world which could detect the launching of the Sputnik."" ""And the press recognised immediately that this was the intercontinental missile."" It led to a hidden role for the University of Manchester's radio telescope. British and US intelligence chiefs soon realised its potential for monitoring the Soviets' inter-continental ballistic missile tests. These rockets were designed to carry nuclear warheads many times more powerful than the atomic bombs which devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War Two. Staff would soon notice GCHQ's ""secret squirrels""  from Cheltenham visiting two labs above the foyer of the control building. Sir Bernard and his two members of staff were sworn to secrecy. The Jodrell Bank monitoring also discovered failed Soviet attempts to land a robotic space probe on the moon to scoop up a sample of lunar soil and bring it back to Earth. Jodrell Bank's team heard the telltale signals as the probe crashed into the surface of the moon. Bizarrely, when the signal stopped the head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences rang Sir Bernard to ask him if he had been listening to the spacecraft's signals. The Soviets asked for a copy of the recording and told him they already had a ""man in the air"" on the way to Manchester Airport. In scenes that perhaps could have come straight out of a James Bond movie, an engineer carried a copy of one of the tapes in an envelope and drove up to the airport. Once there, he handed the envelope to a Soviet official who flew straight back to Moscow.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75156675kyo

2025-11-25,'Beloved' red panda dies at wildlife park,science,BBC,"Zookeepers have said they are sad after a ""beloved and cherished"" red panda died. Suri, who was more than 10 years old, had been at Paradise Park, in Hayle, Cornwall, since 2016, where she had taken part in visitor handling sessions, keepers said. They said the wildlife sanctuary had given more than £20,000 to the Red Panda Network, a conservation and research group, from donations from the sessions. Keeper Becky Waite said Suri had been very popular with visitors as she had often chosen to sit on their laps and be hand-fed while they learnt about the work being done to protect red pandas in the wild.

2025-11-24,Vape recycling scheme launched to cut fire risk,science,BBC,"Households in Doncaster will be able to leave vapes, e-cigarettes and small batteries out with their recycling from this week to combat a ""surge"" in battery-related fires. Residents have been told to put items in a sealed clear bag on top of their blue bin for refuse crews to collect. Doncaster Council said the change was aimed at addressing a rise in batteries being dangerously discarded, which had resulted in a growing number of fires in collection vehicles and at recycling facilities across the UK. Deputy Mayor of Doncaster, Glyn Jones, said he hoped the new service would remove the confusion for residents and reduce the danger to refuse crews. Residents have been told packaging must be removed from any vapes and batteries, and that any loose wires or connectors should be taped. Larger batteries, such as car batteries, must still be taken to household waste recycling centres, the council added. Jones sad: ""We know that depositing items such as batteries can often be confusing and, if placed in the bin, dangerous for our crews as they catch fire very easily, so we believe this move will have a dual benefit – help recycling and reduce the danger to refuse crews across the city."" The council said the following items would be accepted: Shane Atkins, from waste management firm SUEZ, said: ""Putting batteries in household bins can cause fires in collection vehicles and at recycling facilities, putting crews and the public at risk. ""By collecting them separately at the kerbside, we can make sure batteries are recycled properly and safely.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9ledygl8o

Suffolk Wildlife Trust said £775,000 had been secured to complete the purchase of Worlingham Marshes, located within the Broads National Park. will return to the site's wet woodland, and otters and water voles will use the network of waterways as a breeding habitat. Christine Luxton, chief executive of the trust, said: ""By securing Worlingham Marshes as a new nature reserve, we're protecting even more space in the Lower Waveney Valley for nature's recovery. ""Thank you so much to everyone who has supported our fundraising appeal."" The trust said 381 acres (154 hectares) of land had been purchased, thanks to £2m from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and further donations from businesses, charities and the public. The land was previously privately owned and used for grazing and wildfowling. With fen, scrub, dykes and foot drains - as well as the River Waveney on the northern boundary - the trust said there was ""ample opportunity to extend the wildlife-rich habitats, create new wetland features and restore the historic Broadland landscape"". Since the trust secured the stewardship of the site last year, before it could buy the land outright, it said kingfishers, merlin, short-eared owls, marsh harrier, otters, grass snakes, butterflies and dragonflies had already called it home. The purchase also puts the wildlife trust a step closer to creating a wildlife corridor along the Waveney Valley, which includes connecting its existing reserves at Castle Marshes, Carlton Marshes and Oulton Marshes. Lewis Yates, the site's new warden, said: ""It's been amazing to see the level of local support for our vision for Worlingham Marshes, and a real joy to share this with the community. ""I can't wait to see how the reserve develops over the coming years.""

Two orders against Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil (JSO) were made in May and June 2023, lasting for five years with an annual review. They prevented activists from blocking major London thoroughfares such as Marble Arch, Park Lane and Vauxhall Bridge. Mr Justice Morris said at a hearing on Monday there had been no further disruptive protests since the summer and concluded it was not appropriate for the injunction to continue and that it should be discharged. On 27 March, JSO published a statement to say members were ""hanging up the hi-vis"" and claiming that the group's demand for no new oil and gas licences ""had been met"". At a hearing in May, Mr Justice Morris agreed to continue the order over the summer to test the sincerity of the group's stated intention. Andrew Fraser-Urquhart KC, for Transport for London, which brought the injunctions, said at the time this was ""necessary because protests typically happen in the summer months"". About 300 people were named on the injunctions from Insulate Britain and JSO, Mr Justice Morris said, though only one - David Crawford of Insulate Britain - attended court.

2025-11-25,Record low salmon count in river for second year,science,BBC,"A river has recorded a ""catastrophic"" salmon count, hitting a record low for a second successive year, a charity has said. Since 2002, the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT) has spent about four weeks in late summer catching and tagging juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Frome in Dorset. Numbers fell to 3,226 this year, from The charity said the species was at risk from climate change and fishing practices at sea, combined with algal growth and sediment in the River Frome. Dylan Roberts, head of fisheries at GWCT, said similar issues were affecting other rivers and could lead to UK extinction in the next 30 years. He said: ""My team has seen first-hand the changes to the physical nature of the River Frome. ""In recent years, we have seen a huge increase in the growth of algae between spring and autumn which smothers the riverbed, shades and then reduces the growth of plants like water crowfoot, which are crucial habitats for juvenile salmon and the insects upon which they feed. ""We've also seen increases in the quantity of sediment, which is mud running from the riverbanks and ploughed fields into the river where it smothers and suffocates salmon eggs."" He said algae thrived on fertilisers, sewage and septic tank discharges and the trust was working on solutions with farmers. Ian Baggs, who farms near Wareham, said he had planted deep-rooted grass along the river to avoid silt as well as run-off from his previous maize crop. He added: ""I'm happy to look at doing more... but like many I need adequate financial support and expert guidance."" Colin Smart, from the Environmental Farmers Group Dorset, said: ""Farmers do care about the environment and can make a real difference but also need to produce food and make a living. ""They need adequate compensation to put the right measures in place."" The GWCT count took place between 22 August and 17 September.

The Welsh government body, tasked with conservation and protecting the environment, hopes the findings help it focus resources on areas at highest risk of losing species forever. Since the start of the millennium, Wales has already witnessed the loss of 11 species, with the European turtle dove and belted beauty moth becoming geographically extinct. The Species in Peril report warns others could face a similar fate, including the high brown fritillary butterfly and rainbow-coloured Snowdon leaf beetle, Arctic-Alpine pea mussel, woolly feather-moss and eyed chestnut wrinkle-lichen. But saving them may not cost the earth, according to NRW specialists. ""Some of the solutions for these species are incredibly simple,"" said Mannon Lewis, strategic projects lead for the body. ""It is to do with changing the grazing regime, changing when we cut our grass, not felling, looking at different ways of trimming our hedges. ""They are low-cost, simple measures and now we know exactly where we need to do it."" The report pinpoints the role both nature reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) play in ensuring plants and animals survive. It highlights locations such as Newborough Warren on Anglesey, which is home to 130 of the at-risk species. It is a designated national nature reserve, made up of sand dunes and forests, where projects are already under way to improve the environment. Among steps already taken are the introduction of ponies to graze and opening up some of the dunes to the elements. ""It's already achieved a lot,"" said Mike Howe, one of the ecologists who helped draw up the new study. ""Within months of opening up some of these bare areas, we had species of beetle, which hadn't been recorded on Newborough for about 10 years, suddenly appearing in huge numbers."" Conservationist Tyler Hallman said NRW's approach - particularly linking networks of special sites and nature reserves - offered a positive way forward and could even lead to species currently extinct in Wales making a return. ""I think there are huge conservation success stories,"" said Dr Hallman, a lecturer in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at Bangor University. ""The European turtle dove is extinct in Wales but, over the last few years, their population in Europe has increased greatly so who knows - that one might come back. ""You might see things coming back as conditions improve and the species as a whole do better.

2025-11-25,Good news for wild swimmers as bathing water quality improves,science,BBC,"The number of monitored bathing sites in England meeting minimum standards for water quality has risen slightly since last year, according to new figures from the Environment Agency. Out of the 449 sites regularly tested this summer, 93% met minimum standards for levels of bacteria in the water, linked to sewage spills, agricultural pollution and other factors. That is better than the 92% of 2024. Overall, 32 sites were rated ""poor"" - down from 37 in 2024, which was the worst year since the new measurement system began in 2015. The government said its reforms to bathing water rules will help further, but campaigners said that swimming in England's rivers was still too often risky to health. Water Minister Emma Hardy said: ""These changes sit alongside our wider action to clean up our waterways so communities across the country can enjoy the places they care about most."" A spokesperson for industry body Water UK said that the quality of England's bathing water remains high and that companies have a plan to reduce sewage spills. The Environment Agency (EA) monitors levels of bacteria at bathing water sites in rivers, lakes and the sea across England between May and September each year by taking thousands of samples. Levels of bacteria are affected by pollution from sewage spills, agriculture and other sources - but can also be affected by the weather. The summer of 2025 was particularly dry. All else being equal, that should lead to less pollution, with less runoff from rainfall. The latest figures cover a four-year period from 2022 to 2025, where measurements are available. They show a rise in the percentage of sites with the top rating of ""excellent"" to 66%, up from 64% last year. The percentage of sites rated ""poor"" – failing to meet minimum standards – fell from 8% to 7%. But that is still the second highest figure over the past decade. Alan Lovell, chair of the EA, said: ""Bathing water quality in England has improved significantly over recent decades, and this year's results show the continued impact of strong regulation, investment and partnership working. ""But we know there is more to do, and the new bathing water reforms will strengthen the way these much-loved places are managed,"" he said. More bathing sites have been added in recent years, effectively requiring more places to meet the highest standards for people to be able to swim. Bathing sites in rivers performed much worse than those in the sea, where the vast majority of bathing sites are located. Of the 14 river sites, only two met the minimum standards. Many of these rivers were only added to the list of monitored bathing sites in 2024, which can complicate comparisons over time. The EA says part of the reason that water quality is poorer in rivers is because salty seawater can act as a natural disinfectant and the sea dilutes pollutants faster. Rivers are often closer to pollution sources too. James Wallace, chief executive of River Action UK, described the results for England's river bathing water sites as ""deeply concerning"". ""Despite being our most protected river sites, the government's own data shows that swimming in our inland bathing waters carries significant health risks, underlining the failure of regulators to hold polluters to account,"" he said. The latest figures come after the EA gave England's water companies last month for their environmental performance in 2024, amid a spike in serious pollution incidents. of the ""failing"" water sector in England and Wales recommended stronger regulation to hold water companies to account. But it warned that there would be no quick fixes to improve the state of our rivers or bring down bills. In response to today's figures, a spokesperson for Water UK said: ""These results show that the quality of English bathing water remains high with 87% achieving a 'good' or 'excellent' rating. ""This is a stark contrast to the 1990s when less than a third of bathing waters would have met today's standards."" to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Prince William's went on a beach walk in Colwyn Bay with members of the Marine Conservation Society's Youth Ocean Network and spoke to some of the Colwyn Bay Blue Tits - a cold water swimming group. He told swimmers Chrissy Bolton, Georgia Daniels and Midge Owen Smith that he has done some cold water dips in Scotland, and agreed that ""you feel great afterwards"". ""I love it,"" he told them, adding: ""I do a lot of yelling and screaming when I get in."" The prince has seemingly had a change of heart in relation to the hobby, which Catherine, Princess of Wales, has previously spoken about enjoying herself. Speaking on a special episode of The Good, The Bad & The Rugby podcast in 2023, the princess said her husband had told her ""Catherine, you're crazy"" for her own love of cold water dips even in dark and rainy weather. On Tuesday Prince William returned to the region of north Wales where he previously spent several years serving as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in the RAF. His visit was organised to shine a spotlight on young people living in coastal communities. He arrived to cheers from a crowd of about 250 people at Porth Eirias in Colwyn Bay and spent some time shaking hands and chatting with people lined up along the sand. Alison Bickers, from Chester, came across the border especially for the visit and said she was thrilled to see him because he ""does so much for the environment"". Mari Barnhart, originally from from Indianapolis in the US and now living in Old Colwyn, was on the beach with her dog Ned. She said it was ""exciting to be a part"" of it and that her American friends would ""never forgive me if I didn't come down"". Angela Jones, from Conwy, said she managed to have a chat and a hug with Prince William, adding that she ""loves him"" and ""can't believe he's so tall"". In addition to members of the Youth Ocean Network - a team of young people who work with the society to help improve youth engagement in marine conservation across the UK - Prince William met volunteers and young people who were involved in the society's Hiraeth Yn Y Mor project. The community-led project, which concluded in March 2025, saw young people engage with the coastal communities of Prestatyn, Rhyl, Kinmel Bay and Towyn. The initiative was focused on growing ocean literacy, improving the sustainable management of the local marine heritage and promoting the health and wellbeing benefits of connecting with the ocean. The prince heard stories of what they learned through their work on the project and chat about the ocean's influence and the importance of spending time by the sea for mental wellbeing. He also visited Youth Shedz in the village of Mochdre, which creates a safe space for young people who might be experiencing challenges such as school exclusion, bullying and homelessness. After being presented with a bag of sweets for his children upon his arrival at Youth Shedz, he joked that they ""may never make it back to the children"". The charity was founded in 2017 and offers support to children and young people navigating complex challenges. It offers activities and workshops that help them build the foundations for a fulfilling life. The future king was based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, off the north-west coast of Wales, during a three-year tour with the Search and Rescue Force.

But the Environment Agency (EA) data, covering a four-year period from 2022 to 2025, showed the water quality at Dymchurch, Littlestone, Worthing Beach House and Bognor Regis (Aldwick) was rated as poor. Deal Castle Beach in Kent, which had its in 2024 due to poor water quality, has seen the biggest improvements, with its rating changed to good. Enthusiastic members of the Deal Dippers sea swimming group, which meets daily,  took to the water earlier to celebrate their beach's improved rating. One swimmer, Deirdre Wells, said: ""It's fantastic to get that stamp of approval back. ""It was really devastating when we lost the accreditation last year."" Another, Heather Paddison, said: ""I've heard of people who won't swim because of the water quality. ""For people who want to come in the summer and let their children swim, it will make a difference.""

The National Police Chiefs' Council said it would be working in the countryside, while the government said it would be a ""vital step"" in tackling rural crime. Mr Yates, who sits on the National Farmer's Union Council, said the criminals were ""the type of people who if they're encountered, they threaten to burn your barn down"". He said farmers in his WhatsApp group told him fly-tipping and hare coursing were big problems at the moment. ""Farmers take a lot of pride in establishing our crops and it is very annoying to see tracks, vehicles driven across often getting stuck [and]making a hell of a mess,"" he said. Mr Yates said he spoke to a woman on Monday night who farmed near Much Wenlock and told him: ""It's got to the stage now where she's frightened to go out at night around her farm and her children are likewise."" He said there were ""a number of people who believe they are beyond the law"". The response from farmers had been to block farm entrances, install security cameras and to hide expensive items out of site, he said. But he believes the police struggle to cope because ""the blue line is spread too thinly"". ""We feel very remote in certain parts of Shropshire, certainly South Shropshire where I live,"" he said. Farmers have set up groups to ""look after each other"" and Mr Yates said: ""We almost have to look after things ourselves.""

Damien Kelly, the Neighbourhood Inspector for South Shropshire, said West Mercia Police recognised the concerns raised by Mr Yates, including the hare coursing and fly-tipping. He said he had ""finite resources"" and a wide area to cover, so had to ""work smartly"" and use intelligence and information from the public to target problem areas and certain individuals. But Insp Kelly said he was ""really positive"" about police numbers after receiving six extra constables and a sergeant in the last six months. He said: ""That is massive for us. It allows us to dedicate more time, more focus on the things that really matter to the rural communities. ""People can sometimes feel as if they're forgotten. I want to reassure them that we absolutely do not."" He said recent operations in his area had resulted in a decline in rural crime, and there was work going on behind the scenes which he could not talk about.

Her skull was found buried at Holy Trinity Kendal Parish Church in Kendal, Cumbria, in 2022. More than 300 people voted to name the woman Agnes, who was estimated to be in her 50s when she died in the mid-12th Century. Environment Agency (EA) archaeologist Steve Dean said had ""opened a window into the past"" and helped residents connect with her history. Agnes was officially named at an event on Tuesday at the church, close to where she was found. Skeletons from 14 bodies were found buried there when the EA started work on a flood management scheme in 2022. Although most of the skeletons were crushed because they had been beneath the churchyard wall for centuries, Agnes' skull was in good enough condition for the reconstruction. She is estimated to have died in the 1200s and is believed to have lived in the town all of her life. Mr Dean said the project by Liverpool John Moores University to recreate Agnes' appearance ""had made people understand what she had gone through and given a connection to the community"". ""It opens up a window into the past and it's really nice to see,"" he added. The archaeologist said he had heard from residents who had ""spotted people who looked like Agnes"" walking in Kendal and Staveley. ""There very may will be a bit of Agnes still walking around the local population,"" he added. Mr Dean previously said Agnes' bones suggested she led ""a hard life"", with the reconstruction showing the ""ruddy complexion of one who has worked outdoors extensively, probably in the fields which would have surrounded the town"". There were indications she had been buried without a coffin and her position in the church yard suggest she was not of high status.

The University of Surrey said the model was the first of its kind and capable of ""detailing how the retina can build its complex structure from just one type of stem cell"". The research team has simulated key stages of retinogenesis – the process by which identical original cells diversify into the six types of neurons that make up the retina. A spokesperson said the research would ""deepen our understanding of how sight develops and how its development could inform studies of injury or disease"". Cayla Harris, lead researcher from the University of Surrey's nature inspired computing and engineering group, said: ""The beauty of biology is that complex structures can emerge from simple rules. ""Our simulations show how genetically identical cells can, through intrinsic bias and chance, self-organise into the retina's highly ordered layers – a pattern that underpins how we see the world."" The team modelled virtual cells that grow, divide and make decisions based on internal gene-regulation logic, mimicking biological behaviour. They tested different network designs for how genes might interact when cells decide what kind of neuron to become. This approach could with understanding of not just healthy eye development but also what happens in retinal diseases and how stem cells might rebuild tissue, according to the researchers. Dr Roman Bauer, senior lecturer, said: ""Computational modelling gives us a powerful way to explore biological processes we can't easily observe in real time.

The water at Heacham, near Hunstanton in Norfolk, has been deemed poor since 2021, but has now improved its rating, although critics have questioned this. Wells-next-the-Sea and Caister-on-Sea, also in Norfolk, and Holland-on-Sea and Jaywick in Essex, have now been graded as excellent instead of good, with Hunstanton Main and Old beaches and Manningtree, in Essex, rising from sufficient to good.

""However, we recognise there is still a need to improve water quality - Shoeburyness has deteriorated from excellent to good this season,"" Mr Raine said. ""We continue to work with a range of organisations to further improve water quality and will take action where we need to prevent the pollution of our streams, rivers and seas."" Thirty-two sites across the country were classified as poor in the , an improvement on the 37 spots that failed to meet the minimum standard for advisable bathing last year. The EA said more than 97% of East Anglia's bathing spots met sufficient or higher standards for levels of bacteria in the water linked to sewage spills, agricultural pollution and other factors. However, Kirsty Davies, community water quality manager at Surfers Against Sewage, said the classifications were "" dangerously out of touch with reality"" and regulations ""stuck in the past"".

Ms Davies added that the government needed to make extra efforts to commit to water quality testing and bathing water regulations that ""actually protect human health"". which could affect people's health. In particular, it looks for E. coli and intestinal enterococci (IE) bacteria, which can  cause severe stomach upsets. has been disputed between experts and locals, but the council has said its coastal waters may have always had high pollution levels. Studies suggested 60% of IE bacteria recorded in human and animal waste may be coming from seabirds, which flock to The Wash in huge numbers. - which came into force last week - will better reflect how people use bathing spots across England. The changes will include getting rid of fixed seasons, so there will be more flexibility around times water is tested. The definition of bather will also be expanded to water sports enthusiasts such as surfers, paddleboarders and kayakers. The new rules will also mean that bathing spots will not have statuses automatically removed after five years' of poor ratings in a row and the issues will be looked at instead.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp89793gp45o
2025-11-26,Dog charity extends £100k fundraising deadline,science,BBC,"A charity that helps adults with physical disabilities to train their own canine pet to become an assistance dog has given itself longer to raise the £100,000 it needs to stay open. Dog Aid, which is based in Shrewsbury, said it needed the help because, like many small charities, it had suffered rising costs and a reduction in grants and donations. When it launched its appeal last month, it set itself a deadline of 15 November to raise the money, but has now extended that to 15 January. CEO Belinda Johnson said the charity had already raised £45,000 and she had ""been blown away by people's generosity"" so far. Since Dog Aid was founded in 1996, it has helped 476 disabled people to ""train their dogs and improve their lives"". The charity has five members of staff, and they help people with dogs to coach their own pets. Ms Johnson said she was ""optimistic and hopeful"" of raising the remaining money and the charity had ""received a huge amount of support from the communities of Shropshire"". She said she hoped people might be motivated to give to the charity over the festive period.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2plry14xvo
2025-11-26,Record number of cattle-friendly birds at reserve,science,BBC,"More cattle egrets have been spotted at a wetland nature reserve than ever before. Experts used a thermal imaging camera to count the small, white herons - renowned for their close relationship with grazing animals such as cows, sheep and horses - as they gathered to roost at Martin Mere in West Lancashire. The species feeds on invertebrates, including grasshoppers, ticks and crickets, taking advantage of grassy areas being churned up by hooves. Martin Mere said the rise from 29 to 74 cattle egrets was likely linked to a combination of a warmer winter and breeding habitats being better protected. Highly sociable, cattle egrets typically nest and roost in large colonies, often alongside other heron species. Their growing presence at Martin Mere mirrors a wider trend across the UK. Once considered a rare visitor, the species first bred in Britain in 2008, when two pairs nested in Somerset following a large influx of birds that winter. Since then, their population has expanded, from occasional sightings to dozens of breeding pairs nationwide. Wildlife-friendly farming practices may also be contributing to their numbers, Martin Mere said. Regenerative approaches that improve soil health support richer invertebrate populations, creating ideal feeding conditions for the cattle egret.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e473ydyjzo
2025-11-26,'Once in 300 years' rain hits Thai city as floods ravage South East Asia,science,BBC,"Parts of Thailand are battling record floods, which have killed at least 33 people and prompted authorities to deploy military ships and helicopters to support relief efforts. The deluge has hit 10 provinces across the country's south over the past week, with the city of Hat Yai, a business hub bordering Malaysia, recording its heaviest rainfall in 300 years - 335mm in a single day. Photos show vehicles and houses submerged in the city, while desperate residents await rescue on their rooftops. Relentless rains have also ravaged neighbouring countries. In Vietnam, the in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes. In Indonesia, at least 19 people have been killed and at least seven others remained buried under landslides in North Sumatra, according to the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency. More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency. The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day. Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a ""floating hospital"" if required, the navy said. Boats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located. The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief. However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated. People have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. ""Many people are trapped... Please help,"" one user wrote. ""It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!"" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: ""Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone."" Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days. A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them. In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas. In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads. Heavy seasonal rain is common around this time of year in South East Asia, but this year has seen exceptionally high levels of flooding in the region.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg97wx144jo
2025-11-27,'Quad bike fall bent me in half like a taco',science,BBC,"A farmer who survived a quad bike accident that bent him ""in half like a taco"" has urged others to get proper insurance and called for more industry-specific information and first aid training. Dafydd Morris Jones, from Ponterwyd, Ceredigion, broke his back and neck in the accident. The 43-year-old spent four months in hospital and said he would not be able to return to farming for at least a year while he awaited further surgery. ""I didn't insure myself sufficiently for accidents,"" he said. ""If accidents happen, the cost of not being able to work is huge."" Gwenno Davies, from the Farmers' Union of Wales, said farmers were more than 20 times more likely to suffer fatal accidents at work than the average for all other sectors combined. ""Farm safety must be our first consideration – not last,"" she said. Mr Morris Jones said he had been gathering sheep on 17 June when the front wheel of his quad bike slipped on a piece of fern, causing the rear wheel to lift and throw him off. ""Unfortunately, as I was going in the direction of the slope, the bike followed me and lifted my feet up and bent me in half like a taco, breaking my back,"" he said. He landed in the bracken, badly injured, with no feeling in his legs. His mother, who saw the bike ""cartwheeling"" downhill, rushed over and heard him calling for help. While waiting for emergency services, they used their first aid knowledge to pack fern around his back and stabilise his injuries. Mr Morris Jones was flown by air ambulance to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he spent three-and-a-half weeks unable to move while surgeons worked to stabilise his back with screws and rods. He was then transferred to Llandough Hospital recovery centre in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, to begin therapy and learn to walk again. After nearly four months of treatment, he returned home on 10 October, still wearing a brace and awaiting further surgery on his neck. ""Thankfully I'm back on my feet but without the care and a long hospital stay I wouldn't be where I am today,"" he said. Mr Morris Jones said all farmers should prepare for accidents and respond ""sensibly"" given the ""dangerous nature"" of farm work. He said he lost his phone during the accident, highlighting the need for devices like watches that can alert emergency services and contacts. ""Being able to treat ourselves and our families before help arrives is absolutely essential,"" he said. According to the Health and Safety Executive, farm machinery is the leading cause of deaths and serious accidents in agriculture. It said 22 people, including two children, had died on farms across Wales, England, and Scotland since 1 April - and there were 24 deaths on Welsh farms between 2019 and 2023. A spokesperson from the Welsh Farm Safety Partnership said it was ""essential farmers improve safety practices significantly, especially with machinery"". It also urged farmers to ""take caution and prepare in advance"", for example, ""check ATVs, the weather, your route, have a phone, wear a helmet and let someone know where you are going and when you'll be home"". Agricultural unions have also called on farmers to ensure they have full and adequate insurance. Aled Griffiths, from the National Farmers' Union, said ""insurance can be expensive but farmers must consider the cost of an accident, their monthly bills and who will carry out the work if they're unable to"". He added: ""Unfortunately, if someone is underinsured, then if there is an accident, if there are bills, only a portion of the cost will be paid and, of course, that can have serious implications."" Mr Morris Jones said he was staying positive, adding: ""Around the house, I'm on my feet with the help of sticks and there's a clear path to further recovery. ""I hope to be back farming within a year. I'm not sure if that's realistic, but the need - and desire - to get back drives me forward.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q5zq1lw1wo

2025-11-27,UK's 'largest' floating solar farm given go-ahead,science,BBC,"A floating solar farm described as the UK's largest is to be built in the north of England after planning permission was approved. The 46,500-panel array will be installed at the Port of Barrow's Cavendish Dock in Cumbria and will be capable of producing enough energy to power 14,000 homes a year. It will be built by Associated British Ports (ABP) and will be used to power the area's advanced manufacturing sector, including submarine-maker BAE Systems. The company's divisional port manager Bryan Davies said the solar farm would ""drive economic growth"" and was a major milestone in the company's plans to develop Port of Barrow. The application was approved by Westmorland and Furness Council on Monday despite an objection from the Cumbria Bird Club over concerns it would disturb lapwings and curlews, which used the dock to rest and feed. However, ABP's proposal included a number of measures to improve biodiversity, including installing seabird nesting rafts, floating reed beds and artificial habitats under the solar panels. ABP said Barrow Energy Dock would help BAE Systems Submarines secure renewable power for decades. Kirsten Abbott, ABP's senior project manager for energy generation and storage, said: ""The energy is intended to be used by the advanced manufacturing sector and will help to better control the cost of electricity at the port as well as helping to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy resilience for local industry."" The solar farm is part of ABP's wider plans to redevelop the Port of Barrow, which also includes building a new base to support off-shore wind production.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd6n8x31zlo

Upper sections of Moorfield car park, in Truro, were by Cornwall Council after an engineering inspection in May 2024. It resulted in the loss of more than 400 spaces in the 680-space car park. Reform UK's Susanne Desmonde said: ""Several prominent independent businesses have approached me regarding the lack of parking in Truro and the significant impact it is having."" Cornwall Council said it was looking at what could be done at the site. Desmonde, who represents Pool and Tehidy, told Dan Rogerson, the Liberal Democrat cabinet member for transport that businesses ""are questioning why Moorfield has been deemed unsafe after over 50 years of safe use"". She told a meeting of Cornwall Council on Tuesday that officers said the building was ""structurally unsafe"", but an independent assessment found ""it could be reopened safely if remedial works were carried out"". Rogerson said: ""Moorfield car park has lived beyond the life it was built for. ""We have to take the advice of structural engineers and we will act on that."" Recently, further car parks in Truro have been shut to make way for The council was putting together proposals to create the maximum car parking it could on the multi-storey car park site, he said. ""It's not going to fall on cars that are underneath it, but you can't put the weight on the top anymore, so the sensible thing to do is to take it down.""

2025-11-28,Medieval grave slab found on seabed now on display,science,BBC,"A grave slab raised from the site of a 13th Century shipwreck has gone on display in a museum for the first time. The Mortar Wreck, so-called for its cargo of stone tools used to grind food, was found about a mile (1.6km) off the Dorset coast in Studland Bay, Isle of Purbeck. Tom Cousins, who led the excavation, said the site had been known for years, but was dismissed as nothing more than a pile of stones. New surveys in 2019 and 2020 revealed a treasure trove of artefacts, which are now being exhibited in Poole museum in Dorset. Researchers said the discovery deepened their understanding of the stone trade in Britain and Europe. The Mortar Wreck, dated to about 1250, is the oldest surviving English shipwreck with a surviving, visible hull, according to Historic England, and was given protected status in 2022. Among other finds were a stone cauldron for cooking, and Irish timbers used for the hull. Mr Cousins, maritime archaeologist at Bournemouth University, said: ""Our skipper said 'have you ever dived this mark?' ""We said 'no, because it's rubbish, there's nothing there'. ""When [the divers] came up, they said: 'You need to come down and see this'."" The star finds from the shipwreck were two 13th Century grave slabs of Dorset Purbeck Stone, which has been quarried on the Isle of Purbeck since at least Roman times. It can be polished like marble and was a popular decorative building material, used in landmarks like the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey. The stone has also been found as far afield as Denmark, according to the archaeologists. ""The 13th Century is the heyday of the marble industry - you won't find a church or cathedral that doesn't have Purbeck marble in it,"" said Mr Cousins. Most of that stone was moved around by ships - but nobody is sure why this one sank. ""It's probably been overloaded, there's a crack in the hull, there's 30 tonnes of stone on board - you can't really do anything about it,"" he said. The ship itself probably looked like a ""souped-up"" version of a classic Viking ship, Mr Cousins said. Marine excavations were unique, he continued, because unlike when digging on land, there are not things mixed in from other time periods. ""It's a small snapshot in time,"" he said. ""We can start reconstructing the culture, the environment."" The researchers said they hoped the slabs would be stepping stones in and helping them understand the massive stone trade of the period. The collections officer for Poole Museum, Joe Raine, called the exhibition ""a real showstopper."" The finds will be placed alongside other maritime finds like those from the Swash Channel wreck, a 17th Century merchant ship that sank near Poole Harbour. ""You can't help getting sucked in,"" said Mr Raine. ""Hopefully [visitors] start to see a little of themselves in those people from 800 years ago.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25yn7m3z0o
2025-11-28,Yorkshire Dales adders examined for national study,science,BBC,"Adders in the Yorkshire Dales are to be studied as part of a national project examining how healthy their populations are across England. The Nidderdale National Landscape (NNL), a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, is playing a leading role in the Natural England recovery project. Scientists said the snakes were in decline nationally, with Nidderdale selected for the DNA analysis study due to its ""well-monitored populations and extensive semi-natural habitats"". Dr Kelly Harmar from the NNL said: ""We have surveyed adders here for several years, and we think Nidderdale could be nationally important for reptiles."" Dr Harmar added: ""Adders are sensitive to disturbance by people, and this is thought to be a major factor in their current population decline. ""Nidderdale's adders are found at remote sites and are less vulnerable to disturbance, but we had multiple recent reports of photographers actively seeking out adders within our protected landscape and sharing the location of their sites. ""We strongly discourage anyone actively seeking out adders, unless it is to document their population for conservation purposes."" Dr Harmar said the genetic testing would indicate whether adders were ""mixing across sites or slipping into in-breeding"". The work is funded by the Natural England Species Recovery Programme, with Natural England staff delivering fieldwork locally alongside the Nidderdale National Landscape team, volunteers and staff from Yorkshire Water. A NNL spokesperson said DNA samples collected from adders would help scientists ""understand population health and connectivity"". ""The whole genome sequencing technique reads the complete genetic code of each snake, revealing whether populations are mixing well or becoming isolated,"" they added. Dr Will Askew of Natural England said: ""Comparing an upland landscape like Nidderdale with other upland, heathland and forest sites in other regions will help us understand how varying levels of connectivity are affecting adder populations and inform what we do to maintain or restore it."" Dr Askew said all sampling would follow ""strict welfare protocols"". He said: ""Adders are gently captured, a tiny number of scales are taken for DNA, and the animal is released on site immediately afterwards.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vjnx9wmy0o
2025-11-27,Island's birds thriving decade after railway project,science,BBC,"An island transformed into a nature haven thanks to excavations from a major engineering project is thriving with record numbers of birds. RSPB Wallasea Island, a 740-hectare reserve at Rochford in Essex, , brought by boat from the tunnels and shafts created by the Crossrail scheme. Before work began more than a decade ago there were just a small number of birds present - but almost 40,000 arrived last winter. Rachel Fancy, Wallasea Island site manager, said: ""It's been really good and an amazing project to be a part of."" Now, the haven on the island, Jubilee Marsh, has nearly 800 avocets, more than 10,000 knot, and nearly 3,000 grey plover and bar-tailed godwits. In total, 39,000 birds arrived last winter. The site was walled off from the sea hundreds of years ago but when it was taken over by the RSPB, it wanted to transform the island back into a haven for birds. It used the earth from the Elizabeth Line excavations to bring part of the island to a metre-and-a-half above sea level and then moulded it to create a new shape to the island, with new sea walls and a mosaic of mudflats and lagoons. In July 2015, parts of the seawall were removed, with the sea flowing back into Wallasea Island for the first time in 400 years, with the newly created wetlands perfect for allowing the birds to feed, nest and refuel. The ""re-wetting"" of the site created lagoons, salt marshes and entire new islands, with the RSPB saying it also created natural flood defences to absorb storm surges and rising water levels. Ms Fancy said:  ""The mud flats and salt marshes along the east coast are all part of a massive flyway - the east Atlantic flyway - which birds will use to migrate through to the winter. ""They stay here through the winter when it's warmer than the north and they move up through the coast in the summer. ""Birds will come in their thousands to feed and breed during the summer."" While Wallasea Island may now be a tranquil environment where birds are thriving, for four years it was a full-blown construction site. The soil from Crossrail was shipped between 2011 and 2015 from London, with work around the clock on boats and the island itself. Ms Fancy added: ""It was totally different to what it is now; high-vis vests, safety helmets, at least 20 dumper trucks plus all the other machinery moving material around to where it needed to be. ""People working on boats 24 hours a day, and then a lunar-scape where you saw bare soil mud being moved, with no vegetation and hardly any wildlife either."" The winter of 2015, shortly after the seawall was breached, saw a very bare landscape with little amounts of seeds or invertebrates for birds to feed on. But since then the island's habitat has improved every year with the peak of 39,000 birds arriving last winter. ""It's been a really good and an amazing project to be a part of, and really nice to see that development afterwards,"" Ms Fancy added. ""From building site all the way through to a peaceful landscape where you can go on a walk and enjoy the wildlife.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgex91yyg1qo
2025-11-28,'Disappointing' decline in salmon migration,science,BBC,"There has been a ""disappointing"" drop in the number of salmon migrating upstream to spawn in the North West, according to the Ribble Rivers Trust. The Clitheroe-based charity said since 2012 the number has fallen by 60% from around 1,000 to 400, as a likely result of climate change. Jack Spees, the CEO of the Ribble Rivers Trust, said: ""It's been really disappointing, for me personally when I came there were between 5,000 and 10,000 salmon swimming up the river every year."" It comes as crowds gathered at Stainforth Force an 8ft (2.5m) waterfall, to see the salmon, which had made their way from the sea, trying to jump upstream. Mr Spees said: ""The decline is ongoing, so we've been working really hard as a trust to address all the issues and get that decline reversed."" ""As human beings we've been degrading our rivers for a few hundred years so it's going to take time to us a while to get them back to their prime condition. ""But we're hoping in the next five to 10 years we'll really start to see that decline bottoming out and starting to increase again."" Mr Spees began working at Ribble Rivers Trust in 2008 as a fisheries scientist and remained inspired by the species: ""This is incredible, they've swum over 3,000 miles at sea. ""They've now reached this natural waterfall and they're desperately trying to get to the really good spawning habitat, where there's lovely clean gravel where they can dig their nests."" As soon as salmon leave the estuary, they swim up the coast into the North Sea towards Greenland to find better food resources. They then use their sense of smell and gravitational field to travel back to where they were spawned. The salmon face many threats, such as predators including birds, otters and anglers. They stop eating to save food in the river for their juveniles and take on the upstream battle to get home. Jack Spees said: ""They'll get battered and scraped, they might pick up infections. By the time they get here they've really gone through the mill and they've still got this incredible obstacle to overcome."" Charlotte Ireland Pope from the Ribble Rivers Trust said: ""Since 2012 numbers have declined quite steadily and quite rapidly. ""We think it's likely that climate change is a major contributing factor, as severe flooding and summer droughts have also increased significantly over the same period. She added that ""changes at sea"" could affect the salmon's life cycle. The cold water helps to protect them against infection and regulates their metabolism, but this has been warming up. Increased flooding also washes their nests, called redds, away said the charity. The Ribble Rivers Trust is working to protect their habitat by planting woodland to help protect against flooding. Other measures included removing artificial barriers like weirs or introducing a 'fish pass', which is similar to a ladder, for the fish to swim over. The Trust has also been working with farmers to reduce the amount of nutrients put into the river to improve water quality.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpynjz75no
2025-11-28,'Antenna will teach us more about bird migration',science,BBC,"A new antenna which tracks birds has made its first detection. Teesside's RSBP Saltholme reserve manager Chris Francis said its Motus antenna, which was installed in May, would help researchers better understand the migratory patterns of the animals. He said the structure had picked up its first birds - two jack snipes - earlier this month. The pair had had travelled from Sweden, albeit via two different slightly routes, according to the Motus tracking network. ""It just builds up a much clearer picture of what these birds are doing,"" Mr Francis said. The Motus system, developed by the non-profit organisation Birds Canada, is an electronic method of tracking birds. Birds are tagged with trackers which are then picked up by antennas around the world. Unlike analogue ringing methods, the birds do not have to be seen by humans to be tracked Mr Francis said: ""Many of these birds fly at night so you wouldn't see them."" The Saltholme antenna, which was funded by the Teesmouth Bird Club and cost about £5,100, revealed one of the jack snipes had flown from Sweden to Denmark and then to the UK, whereas the other bird had flown from Sweden to Germany before its trip to Teesside. Mr Francis said: ""If they go back to Sweden next year, hopefully they'll trigger another antennae somewhere and that information will get recorded."" He called on more organisations to consider installing the equipment as there were several in the south of England but far fewer in the north.

2025-11-28,Camelford water poisoning incident: 'I want the truth to come out',science,BBC,"into the incorrect tank at the Lowermoor Water Treatment Work in north Cornwall. Advice at the time was to boil the water. This was later described at an inquest as the ""worst possible"" advice by professor of bioinorganic chemistry Chris Exley because it would have tripled the aluminium concentration in the water. St Minver resident Carole Wyatt calls the lack of a full inquiry subsequently a ""miscarriage of justice"" in , a new BBC documentary on what has become known as the Camelford water poisoning incident, adding: ""I want the truth to come out."" Nearby residents soon began noticing health problems, such as vomiting, rashes and ulcers. from a rare form of dementia, with postmortem tests showing a heightened amount of aluminium in her brain. The inquest, however, was not able to conclude this as the cause of her death. Though the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 in a 1991 trial, and 148 victims received out-of-court settlements ranging from £680 to £10,000, some are still looking for justice nearly four decades later. Hannah Lowes, who directed Poison Water, says she hopes that the documentary will bring more attention to the incident, adding that residents ""just want people to be talking about it again and to make sure it doesn't happen again"". Paul Tyler was the MP for North Cornwall between 1992 and 2005. In 1994, he brought up the issue during a Parliament debate, and felt his concerns about his constituents and his requests that their long-term health were monitored were ""brushed aside"" by then Minister of State at the Department of Health Brian Mawhinney (who died in 2019). Though the incident happened just before the South West Water Authority was privatised in 1989, Tyler feels the Conservative government avoided looking into the incident fully to prevent public criticism of the government's policy of privatizing public utilities. ""Privatisation was still relatively young,"" he says. ""They didn't want to rock the boat."" In Poison Water, we see a letter sent to then-Minister for Water Michael Howard citing the opinion of members of the South West Water Authority Board, warning that the financial sector may be discouraged to invest in the privatised water companies if an investigation into Camelford led to any employees of the water authority being prosecuted (in the documentary, Howard says he does not recall receiving the letter). Only one senior executive was fired for the incident, while the company's chief executive had his salary doubled shortly after privatisation – a situation Tyler calls ""absurd"". The South West Water Authority was replaced by a new company called South West Water following privatisation in 1989. In a statement, a spokesperson for South West Water said: ""Camelford was a tragic incident that took place before South West Water was founded… in a completely different regulatory era. ""Today, water quality is overseen by strict independent regulators with modern safeguards and rigorous monitoring."" Tyler sees a direct line from the Camelford incident ""not being properly monitored"" to recent controversies around water companies dumping raw sewage into rivers. ""The whole industry should have been subjected to far better regulation,"" he says, adding that he feels the investment and improvement promised by privatisation has not fully materialised. ""The only people who've done very nicely out of privatisation are the shareholders and the directors,"" says Tyler. ""If you're the people who suffered at the hands of a particular water company, would you not feel that was absolutely outrageous?"" In Poison Water, Howard defends his government's stance on privatisation: ""It subjected [companies] to the discipline of competition, and competition helps make companies in any sector more efficient and helps to give consumers better value for money."" In 2013, Health Minister Anna Soubry and Environment Minister Richard Benyon on behalf of the government for the incident. When asked what justice would look like for him nearly 40 years after the incident, Tyler says: ""An admission there was a cover up that damaged the area and the long-term health of individuals would help. But after 37 years, it's frankly impossible for full justice to be given.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7nevqr49ro

2025-11-29,Coop society's climate goals approved by experts,science,BBC,"A business has said its climate goals have been officially approved by global experts as part of its net-zero mission. The Channel Islands Co-operative Society (CI Coop) said it was cutting emissions from its buildings, transport, supply chains and services, including its food stores, pharmacies and funeral homes. It said its targets had been validated by the globally-respected Science Based Targets initiative and placed ""CI Coop among leading businesses committed to tackling the climate emergency"". CI Coop said it aimed to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire chain by 2040. Mark Cox, chief executive officer of CI Coop, said: ""Our members and customers expect us to lead on sustainability, and we take that responsibility seriously."" Since 2024 the society said it had worked with sustainability firm, Simply Sustainable, to measure emissions using an industry standard. A spokesperson from Simply Sustainable, said: ""The ambition shown by the Channel Islands Coop is exactly what's needed to meet the challenges of the climate emergency."" Carl Winn, head of community and sustainability at CI Coop, said that achieving validation through Science Based Targets initiative showed a commitment to ""meaningful climate action"".

2025-11-30,Crafting replica Viking shield 'labour of love',science,BBC,"A man who crafted a replica Viking shield in his garden shed before donating it to a museum on the Isle of Man said the process was a ""labour of love"". Chris Clayton, who lives in Rotherham and works as an outdoor activity instructor in Nottingham, has a keen interest in Viking history and goes into schools to teach children about the time period. A regular visitor to the island, he took his inspiration for the replica from a shield found in a Viking burial site in Ballateare, in Jurby, in the 1940s. The piece of armour, which had been put on display at the House of Manannan in Peel, was made using historically accurate materials and techniques and took eight weeks to complete. Helping to fuel his interest in the Viking era, Chris said he would visit the museums whilst over to see his parents and sister who live on the island. The idea for the replica was born after he saw the rare fragments of painted leather from the original Ballateare shield, he said, adding: ""I thought I'd be so stoked to have my piece in the museum."" ""I just interpreted it in my own mind - knowing what I know about Viking shields. ""I'm not a craftsman by trade, I've learnt by reading Viking sagas and looking at other things people have made - I don't take anything lightly ""This was an absolute labour of love"". He said historical accuracy was an important part of the process in recreating the shield, and research had shown many similar items from the era were bound together by animal glue, mainly from rabbits. ""The problem with rabbit glue is as soon as it gets damp, it degrades so it's not very practical,"" Chris said. The process saw him carve the shield from pine wood, using ""tanned lambs leather"" for the base and ""thicker cow leather"" for the outer rim of the shield. After eight weeks of labour in his garden, Chris went to deliver his work to Allison Fox, Curator for Archaeology at Manx National Heritage (MNH). ""It could have gone either of two ways - if she had disappointment on her face, that would have ruined it all [but] I'm pleased to see the work has paid off.,"" he said. He said he was ""proud"" it would give museum visitors the chance ""to handle the shield and spur their interest in Viking history"". Chris said, while his latest project had found a new home on the Isle of Man, he had recently been convinced by his wife to convert his loft into a space to store al his other his Viking shields and memorabilia. ""While I was making the shield, my wife said 'I think this is why we've managed to stay married so long because I barely see you',"" he joked. Thanking Chris for gifting the shield to the MNH, Ms Fox said the shield was a ""magnificent addition"" to the museum. ""The snap-shots of past life on the Isle of Man are all based upon archaeological evidence from the Island, so this shield is perfect,"" she said. ""We're really pleased that Chris found inspiration in the House of Manannan and very appreciative of his craftmanship - so a huge 'thank you' goes to Chris.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxe97wg0dpo
2025-11-29,"Recycling plant backed, despite traffic concerns",science,BBC,"Plans to build a recycling plant in Chertsey have been approved, despite concerns about increased traffic around the site. Earlier this year Surrey County Council (SCC) outlined proposals for a material recycling centre on arguing that the existing infrastructure is ""under strain"". the Kitsmead Lane site in Longcross will be capable of processing up to 100,000 tonnes of recycling each year – with 164 rubbish vehicle 'movements' every day. When approving the plans earlier this week, the SCC planning committee called for a transport plan to be drawn up. Officers told the meeting on Wednesday: ""Understandably, there still have been concerns about the potential for this to add further vehicles through some of the more sensitive locations. ""To that end we are also recommending, as part of the travel-plan condition, more details on the exact routes that will be used and what measures are in place to minimise movements through sensitive places."" Once built, recycling will be taken from the north and west of Surrey. Currently this gets shipped out to Kent, with a small amount dealt with in Leatherhead. The new facility will therefore mean fewer long journeys out of the county, but an intensification in lorries around the site. This prompted the calls for a transport plan. The plans were voted through unanimously after hearing the former green belt site where the facility is located was now classified as grey field. Runnymede Borough Council had raised concerns over the size of the building and the impact on nearby residents, and similar views were expressed in 21 letters of objection. or WhatsApp us on 08081 002250.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8987e22zlqo
2025-11-28,"Lightning detected on Mars for the first time, scientists say",science,BBC,"Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning. Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region. Electrical discharges nicknamed ""mini lightning"" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument. Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings. A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days). They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts. Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges. Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: ""These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration."" He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity. Particle physicist Dr Daniel Mitchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would ""provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges"", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, ""some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning"". He added: ""Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time."" In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes. It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found. Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life. Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q5w13e58zo
2025-12-01,Why 2026 will be a year like no other for India's Sun mission,science,BBC,"For Aditya-L1, India's first solar observation mission in space, the year 2026 is expected to be like no other. It's the first time the observatory – which was placed in orbit last year - will be able to watch the Sun when it reaches its maximum activity cycle. According to Nasa, it comes roughly every 11 years when the Sun's magnetic poles flip - the Earth equivalent would be the North and South poles swapping positions. It's a time of great turbulence. It sees the Sun transition from calm to stormy and is marked by a huge increase in the number of solar storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - huge bubbles of plasma that blow out of Sun's outermost layer called corona and look like fireballs. Made up of charged particles, a CME can have a mass of up to a trillion kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km (1,864 miles) per second. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth. At top speed, it would take a CME 15 hours to cover the 150 million km Earth-Sun distance. ""In the normal or low-activity times, the Sun launches two to three CMEs a day,"" says Prof R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). ""Next year, we expect them to be 10 or more daily."" Prof Ramesh is the principal investigator on Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, or Velc - the most important of the seven scientific instruments on Aditya-L1 - and closely monitors and decodes the data it gathers. Studying CMEs is one of the most important scientific objectives of India's maiden solar mission, he says. One, because the ejections provide an opportunity to learn about the star at the centre of our solar system, and two, because activities that take place on the Sun threaten infrastructure on Earth and in space. CMEs rarely pose a direct threat to human life, but they do affect life on Earth by causing geomagnetic storms that impact the weather in near space, where nearly 11,000 satellites, ""The most beautiful manifestations of a CME are auroras, which are a clear example that charged particles from Sun are travelling to Earth,"" Prof Ramesh explains. ""But they can also make all the electronics on a satellite malfunction, knock down power grids and affect weather and communication satellites."" The most powerful solar storm ever recorded was the in 1859, which knocked out telegraph lines across the globe. More recent events were recorded in 1989, when a part of Quebec's power grid was , leaving six million people without power for nine hours. In November 2015, air traffic control, leading to chaos in Sweden and some other European airports. that a CME had led to 38 commercial satellites being lost. Prof Ramesh says that if we are able to see what happens on the Sun's corona and spot a solar storm or a coronal mass ejection in real time, record its temperature at origin and watch its trajectory, it can work as a forewarning to switch off power grids and satellites and move them out of harm's way. There are other solar missions watching the Sun, but Aditya-L1 has an advantage over others, including the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory sent jointly by Nasa and Esa (European Space Agency), when it comes to watching the corona. ""Aditya-L1's coronagraph is the exact size that lets it nearly mimic the Moon, fully covering the Sun's photosphere and allowing it an uninterrupted view of almost all of the corona 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, even during eclipses and occultations,"" says Prof Ramesh. In other words, the coronagraph acts like an artificial Moon, blocking the Sun's bright surface to let scientists continuously observe its faint outer corona - something the real Moon does only during eclipses. Moreover, this is the only mission that can study eruptions in visible light, letting it measure a CME's temperature and heat energy - key clues that show how strong a CME would be if it headed toward Earth, says Prof Ramesh. To prepare for next year's peak solar activity period, the IIA collaborated with Nasa to study the data it gathered from one of the largest CMEs that Aditya-L1 has recorded until now. It originated on 13 September 2024 at 00:30 GMT, Prof Ramesh says. Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5 million tonnes, he says. At origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively. Even though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh describes it as a ""medium-sized"" one. The asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million megatons and during the Sun's maximum activity cycle, he says, we could see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that. ""I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we'll be using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle occurs,"" he says. ""The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to be adopted to protect satellites in near space. They will also help us gain a better understanding of near-Earth space,"" he adds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dy9qp71v2o

More than 200 are missing, and some 20,000 homes have been destroyed, sending 108,000 people to state-run temporary shelters, the Disaster Management Centre reported. Officials said that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water as a state of emergency was announced, in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said it is the ""most challenging natural disaster"" in the country's history, and that the destruction was so severe that estimates for reconstruction were staggering. Evacuation orders are in place in some areas as water levels of the Kelani River continue to rise rapidly. A woman from central Sri Lanka told the BBC that about 15 houses in her area were buried under boulders and mud. None of the residents survived, she said. The highest number of deaths was reported in Kandy and Badulla, where many areas remain cut off. ""We lost two people in our village... others are sheltering in a temple and a house that is still standing,"" said Saman Kumara from the Badulla village of Maspanna. ""We can't leave the village, and no one can come in because all roads are blocked by landslides. There is no food, and we are running out of clean water,"" he told News Center website by telephone.

The Department of Agriculture, Environment Rural Affairs (Daera) said surveillance at an abattoir indicated the presence of the disease in two cows from a farm near Bangor, County Down. poses no threat to the public or food safety but can have serious consequences for cloven-hoofed animals like sheep and cattle. A 20km Temporary Control Zone (TCZ) , and Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir said the suspect cases are of ""significant concern"". Speaking to media on Sunday, Muir said that whilst investigations are underway, it is ""highly likely"" that this is a case of bluetongue. ""This has arrived, I'm very confident, on the island of Ireland,"" he said. He described how this ""has the potential to be disruptive"" and said that Saintfield Mart is cancelled this week as it is in the control zone. Muir said his ""department has responded swiftly and hard"" by establishing a control zone and only permitting movement of animals if they are going directly to slaughter. Moves of species susceptible to bluetongue on or off premises within the TCZ are prohibited while officials carry out further investigations. is available that allows animals to cross the boundary if they are going directly to slaughter. Muir said: ""I make no apology for the strength and the speed of these measures we have introduced. It's vital we do that to protect our farming community in Northern Ireland"". ""Vigilance is absolutely key, if farmers see any signs of this disease they need to report it urgently,"" he said. He also said that there would be cross-border efforts to resolve the issue. ""Together we can eradicate this but it requires a collective effort,"" he said. Muir said that vaccines have been made available and hopefully the cold weather ahead will help the response to the virus. Bluetongue virus (BTV-3) affects cattle, goats, sheep, deer and camelids such as llamas and alpacas. It can cause ulcers or sores around the animal's mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness, foetal deformities and stillbirths. The latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep died, and midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south-east of England too. But the impact of BTV-3 seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection and managing to recover. It is a notifiable disease so anyone suspecting their animals may have it must report it to a vet, local divisional veterinary office or to Daera directly. Biting midges are most active from April to November and the potential for spread depends on climatic conditions and wind patterns with lower temperatures significantly reducing the risk, the department said. , which meant that livestock within the country could move freely, but to move them across the border meant farmers had to test each animal, at a cost of about £70 - On 10 November, the Welsh government by issuing a nationwide restricted zone, allowing cross-border movement. Daera Chief Veterinary Officer Brian Dooher said the virus is unpredictable and can spread rapidly between flocks and herds. ""I would urge all farmers to ensure they source their animals responsibly,"" he said. ""All livestock owners should remain vigilant for signs of the disease."" The Republic of Ireland's agriculture minister, Martin Heydon, said his thoughts are with the affected farm family. ""The news of a suspect bluetongue outbreak in Northern Ireland is unwelcome,"" he said. ""If the disease becomes established in one part of the island, it will be that much easier for it to spread, with consequences for animal health and welfare, and financial and emotional stress for farmers. ""I will be engaging closely with Minister Muir on this and ensuring that we continue to take a collaborative and supportive approach, building on the very close relationships already in place on animal disease control north and south."" Bluetongue virus is one element of that, earlier this year, the agriculture environment and rural affairs minister warned the agri-food industry faced. While the virus has no effect on people or food safety, it could have a significant impact on livestock and the rural economy. Vaccination of livestock against the disease , with vets warning then that an outbreak seemed inevitable. The hope now is that tight movement restrictions, combined with cold weather, will help limit any potential spread of the disease. But this detection has come as a blow to a sector beleaguered by costs, incoming taxation changes, and other disease threats. Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist and lecturer at Queen's University Belfast, described the suspected case as ""pretty serious"" but reiterated that the virus ""doesn't pose a threat to human health"". He said while there are economic and animal welfare implications, there are also options to prevent bluetongue ""namely that there are vaccines available for this strain"". ""We really have to think about how we could deploy those vaccines for the next season,"" he added. Dr Bamford said that bluetongue is not endemic in Ireland but warmer weather may lead to more infections as the virus and the insect are ""responsive to a warmer climate"". He added that bluetongue is ""unlikely"" to have an effect this season as it comes from biting insects.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3w0yd93pqo
2025-12-01,'One of a kind' window opened into Scotland's past,science,BBC,"Geologists say they have been given a ""one-of-a-kind"" window into Scotland's past, after getting a chance to analyse core rock from the Great Glen Fault - formed hundreds of millions of years ago. said materials unearthed in investigation work for a hydro-storage scheme in Lochaber had allowed a rare look into a distant geological past. The Great Glen Fault is more than 1,000km (621miles) long and 40km (25miles) deep, stretching from Ireland through Scotland to Norway. Dr Romesh Palamakumbura, a BGS geologist, said it was ""incredible"" to have access to the rocks and see something so ""spectacular and unique"". on the shores of Loch Lochy, near South Laggan. The core was drilled in 2023 when the project began and was delivered to BGS premises in Edinburgh at the end of 2024, where geologists have since been analysing it. Tremors and minor earthquakes are sometimes reported in the area, though rocks associated with the fault zone generally remain mostly hidden to the human eye by the waters of Loch Ness, Loch Oich and Loch Lochy. Geologists were able to study 10m (32ft) of the rocks in an attempt to better understand how such fault systems work and how fluids emerging from deep within the Earth's crust change the properties of the rock. Dr Palamakumbura added:  ""It's such an old fault zone, the fault formed as part of the initial formation of Scotland and that was 400 or so million years ago."" He said there was a ""fundamental geology"" aspect to their studies as they worked to understand ""basic crustal processes"".

2025-11-30,'Hidden' well in cathedral crypt shines blue after mosaic transformation,science,BBC,"An ancient well, located deep in the sacred crypt of a historic Glasgow church, has been excavated and transformed into a major art project, seen by the public for the first time. The well has been quietly sitting for centuries in the lower church of Glasgow Cathedral. In October it was revived under the lead of archaeologist Prof Stephen Driscoll from the University of Glasgow. It has now been enhanced by a stunning light mosaic and will be the focus of a series of concerts and events to celebrate 850 years of the city of Glasgow. Long before Glasgow became a city, the site of the well marked a place of deep spiritual significance. It is believed to be where St Kentigern, also known as Mungo, established his cell and performed baptisms in the waters of the Molendinar Burn below. The natural well was later incorporated into the walls of Glasgow Cathedral, forming the heart of the Kentigern Shrine in the lower church. Over the centuries, this sacred site grew in prominence, becoming one of Britain's major pilgrimage destinations - possibly for more than 1,000 years. The well may predate Christianity as a sacred site, and also symbolically and literally marks the starting point of what would become the city of Glasgow. The mosaic installation, simply called The Well, has been brought to life by the Aproxima Creative Collective team, including Scottish artist Joanna Kessel. It is made of more than 1,000 handblown coloured glass tiles, each inlaid with gold leaf, echoing the colours of the cathedral's stained-glass windows. She explained how the tiles, made at the Orsoni Venezia 1888 furnace in Italy, were actually used back-to-front to give the colours she wanted. ""I had a lot of these glass plates in my studio and this blue-green is actually the back, the reverse of the gold leaf plates. ""So I thought, well I'll just ask Orsoni to supply us with a range so that we could get this transition from light down to dark at the bottom of the well. ""When I spoke to them they were like, oh Joanna, these are the backs. We don't produce this specifically so the front is what they're working to create and the back in some ways is incidental."" Joanna went over to Venice to sift through crates and crates of the gold leaf mosaic to find the right colours. Creative director Angus Farquhar said the well was a powerful but neglected part of Glasgow's story. ""I saw that little well in the corner with no signage and it had just been forgotten and I thought wouldn't it be incredible to bring this back as a gift for the people of Glasgow,"" he said. He said that in the past wells had been associated with poisoning and illness and many of the public wells in Glasgow were capped and then forgotten. So excavation of the well was a significant moment. He said: ""It had not been touched for 70 years and we found coins from all over the world rings, thimbles, tiny pieces of shell with people's names written on them and we realised that it had still been used as a little point of blessing even though there was no signage there and it was dark. ""That idea that we could bring it back became really exciting and just two weeks ago with the support of Historic Environment Scotland we drained out the last of the water and cleaned the bottom of the well where we'd done the excavation and for the first time probably in one or two centuries the water ran clear again.

The re-dedication of the well will be celebrated with musical concerts next weekend. Audiences can also pre-book a timed slot to visit the well and view the new mosaic in the crypt.

2025-12-01,Dozens missing as deadly landslide hits two boats in Peru,science,BBC,"At least 12 people have died and around 50 are still missing after a landslide struck two boats docked at a river port in Peru's Amazon rainforest region, local media reports. The landslide sank a ferry and seriously damaged another passenger vessel that had dozens of people on board, according to a police report cited by the Andina news agency. It happened at around 05:00 local time (10:00 GMT) as passengers were set to disembark at Iparia, in the country's central Ucayali region on Monday. The injured have been taken to hospital while national police and the Peruvian Navy look for more survivors. It is feared that children are among the missing. The landslide was caused by ""erosion"" of the bank of the Ucayali River - the headwater of the Amazon - the country's Some 50 people were on board one of the boats, according to news agency AFP. Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, a navy official told AFP. Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Andina. Authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found.

2025-12-02,Strike-hit city to move to fortnightly bin rounds,science,BBC,"New fortnightly waste and recycling collections are to be rolled out across Birmingham, despite an ongoing nine-month bin strike. The city council has said it is pressing ahead with its shift from weekly bin collections to a fortnight service with a reintroduction of recycling services, including weekly food waste collections. This is despite the ongoing strike, which has left residents without a recycling collection since January. The authority said the ""transformed"" service it is proposing includes a second 180-litre recycling bin for residents, and is subject to cabinet approval on Tuesday 9 December. A spokesperson for the local authority said: ""Historically the service has not been good enough, with a high level of missed collections and one of the lowest recycling rates in the country. This must change."" will be legally required to collect food waste unless it has been granted an extension by the government. It is not yet known if the authority has been given permission to miss the deadline but have already stated they will not be able to commit in time. A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: ""Like many other councils we have been in discussion with Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs) on this but the purpose of the cabinet paper is to ensure we can comply with the intention of the legislation."" Subject to approval, the rollout of the new waste service will be phased, with around 20,000 residents transferring to the new service in fortnightly blocks. The city council provides essential waste collection services to a population of over 1.14m residents and serves approximately 470,000 residential properties across the city. The report on the new service says: ""Birmingham's residents need and deserve a better waste service. ""Even prior to the current industrial action, Birmingham's recycling rate at 23% was among the lowest of any unitary authority in the country. ""In 2024/25 residents registered a total of 121,437 missed bin collections."" Under the review from the city's commissioners, the report added: ""For too long, the service has been expensive, inefficient, and characterised by low productivity and poor customer satisfaction. ""The council must be steadfast in acknowledging this history of underperformance."" Speaking about the new service, councillor Majid Mahmood, cabinet member for environment and transport, said: ""Residents will see a real difference. ""We have already made some changes, with our new council-owned fleet fully operational – there is less reliance on hired vehicles, improved reliability and better consistency in collections. ""Our crews have the tools they need to deliver a more reliable, efficient service while also supporting the city's environmental goals, benefiting both residents and staff. ""The transformed service will bring Birmingham into line with other councils, improve recycling rates and provide a service our residents need and deserve."" Over 1,100 new routes and rounds have been developed and the local authority said it expects 30% of all waste to be recycled in the future. Birmingham's bin collections have been hit by industrial action this year, beginning in March after members of the Unite trade union walked out in a dispute with Birmingham City Council over pay and jobs. Some recruitment agency workers, brought in to ease pressure on bin collections, have since walked out in a separate dispute over bullying and harassment. A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: ""While the ongoing industrial action has delayed the implementation of the new service, the intention is to begin the rollout in June 2026 regardless of the strike situation."" The council also claimed that productivity had improved, ""with fewer complaints than prior to the strike."" ""There has been a 52% improvement rate on missed collections and a 22% improvement on tonnage collected per employee,"" the local authority said. In the third report from the council's commissioners, published on Monday, they said the ""long-awaited and much-needed transformation of this essential service has been delayed as a result of the much-publicised waste dispute"". The report added: ""As an essential frontline service that every household relies upon, the effective delivery of waste and recycling services is fundamental to residents' confidence in the council."" Kathryn Stanczyszyn, political correspondent for BBC News, said of the decision: ""The message is very clear from the city council 'we're going to make this transformation to the bin service with or without the striking workers'. ""It makes further negotiations even more unlikely, and means council leadership  - under the government's commissioner - is so determined to push on that an undisclosed amount of extra spend will be signed off in the event the strike is still on next June. ""The overspend in the waste service already stands at £14m - at a time when purse strings are usually clamped shut. ""For residents it is supposed to mean a better service, albeit fortnightly, and crucially an improvement in the city's currently woeful recycling rates."" Protests over the ongoing bin strike caused an abrupt halt to Tuesday's meeting of Birmingham City Council. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, shouts of ""wasted"" were heard from the public gallery before a woman was seen throwing mock bank notes. After the meeting resumed, there was a second interruption which led to another adjournment for about half an hour. Council meetings have been disrupted numerous times during the bin strike, including when Councillor Zafar Iqbal became lord mayor in May.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy95vyvgv19o
2025-12-02,'Birdgirl' marks decade of making nature accessible,science,BBC,"An environmental campaigner who founded a charity to help children from ethnic minorities access nature says the cultural landscape has ""shifted"" since she began her work a decade ago. Mya-Rose Craig, 23, nicknamed 'Birdgirl', set up Black2Nature at the age of 13 to connect more children from Visible Minority Ethnic (VME) communities with the outdoors. Reflecting on the charity's 10th anniversary, she said the current environment feels ""very different""; although there is still ""a lot of progress to be made"". ""It's amazing to look back over the past decade of all the hundreds of kids that we've worked with,"" she said. ""All the different activities, the lives we've changed."" Ms Craig said that when she first began speaking about the lack of diversity in nature spaces, the reaction was markedly different. ""I remember when I first started having these conversations, people didn't want to have them with me,"" she said. ""It made them very uncomfortable. I think they didn't want to acknowledge that there was exclusion and racism. So much has shifted in the past decade. ""For me, that is really exciting, because I think that is how you build a more sustainable environment, by getting everyone on board."" Black2Nature runs camps, day trips and outdoor adventures designed to increase access for VME children, young people and families. The organisation also campaigns for greater racial diversity in the environmental sector and for equal access to green spaces. Ms Craig, who is from the Chew Valley in Somerset, said the idea to set up the charity came from a ""very deep love of nature and the environment."" ""I strongly felt that nature was a very important resource for other kids to have access to in terms of mental and physical health,"" she said. ""A lot of these kids have never been to the countryside, so it's about breaking down those assumptions. ""For a lot of kids that we work with, they feel like the countryside is not a space for them."" Research from the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) shows that to green space than others in society. For parents such as Kumar Sultana, 42, from Bristol, Black2Nature has provided opportunities her family would have otherwise missed. ""I'm a low-income parent and I can't afford things like camping,"" she explained. She added the activities have helped her children connect with the natural world and learn about sustainability. Ms Sultana, who has a Pakistani background, said she did not have those experiences growing up. ""We don't have camping in our culture and money is also a barrier to accessing it,"" she said. ""Some of the places we've been, I couldn't afford to take my kids."" To mark its 10th anniversary, the charity will host a conference at the University of the West of England (UWE) on Wednesday, focusing on race equity, education and career pathways in the environmental sector. Looking ahead, Ms Craig said she hopes to see environmental organisations engage more meaningfully with diverse communities and for young people to be made aware of career prospects in that sector. She also wants wider access to nature across the UK. ""I'd love to see better quality of green spaces in cities. There's very often a class divide in terms of green spaces, where nicer neighbourhoods have nicer parks.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r3k7rejp1o
2025-12-02,Testing to begin on farms after likely discovery of bluetongue,science,BBC,"Testing is to begin at 20 farms in Northern Ireland after the likely discovery of bluetongue virus. Spread by midges, bluetongue (BTV-3) poses no threat to the public or food safety but can affect cloven-hoofed animals like sheep and cattle. It comes after the Department of Agriculture, Environment Rural Affairs (Daera) said surveillance at an abattoir indicated A 20km temporary control zone was put in place at 21:00 BST on Saturday. Daera veterinary officer Ignatius McKeown said farms within the zone would be tested at random ""to determine the degree of spread of bluetongue"" in the area. ""These will be large farms,"" he said. ""We would like to get as many of those farms tested by the end of this week."" that ""it takes time"" to get the testing set up, but added: ""We will move as fast as we can."" On Monday, Clandeboye Estate told BBC News NI that ""a routine test confirmed the possible presence of the bluetongue antibodies in two animals that had formerly been part of the Clandeboye herd"". They said Daera was notified immediately and they were ""working closely with their veterinary team to carry out further investigations"". The Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) are currently monitoring midge numbers using traps set in seven locations spread out across Northern Ireland. In the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday, Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir said samples taken from cows suspected to have the disease needed to go through ""confirmatory testing"" in laboratories in Germany and England. In July, it emerged that farmers in Northern Ireland would be able to , bringing them in line with the rest of the UK. Biting midges are most active from April to November and the potential for spread depends on climatic conditions and wind patterns with lower temperatures significantly reducing the risk, the department said. Mr McKeown said ""farmers should and must consider"" vaccinating their animals. He also said that that the ""vaccination process will have to take place potentially six months before cattle are put out to grass in the warmer weather"". ""The high risk period will come into place once the temperatures increase in April and May and midges start to appear again. The animals must be immune before that particular time."" ""At this time of year the number of midges about are fairly low, so the risk of further spread at this time is relatively low,"" he added. ""Obviously as temperatures increase in the springtime that is when we expect the potential increase in the spread of bluetongue."" John Martin, whose farm in Greyabbey, County Down, is within the restricted zone, said it was a ""disappointment"" to hear of a potential local case. Mr Martin said there were ""limitations on the movement of livestock"" within the restricted zone - and this had an impact on farmers. ""We have about 150 sheep left to market from lambing this year, so we are negotiating our way through the regulations and the ability to continue to trade and to move those animals to sale,"" he added. ""It's very clear that there are no livestock markets taking place within the restricted zone, so that's having a direct impact on how people would have sold all of their animals in a livestock market."" Mr Martin hasn't ""noticed any signs of diseased animals"" on his farm, but he said ""there's always that concern in the back of your mind"". Bluetongue virus affects cattle, goats, sheep, deer and camelids such as llamas and alpacas. It can cause ulcers or sores around the animal's mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness, foetal deformities and stillbirths. It is a notifiable disease so anyone suspecting their animals may have it must report it to a vet, local divisional veterinary office or to Daera directly. The latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep died, and midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south-east of England too. But the impact of BTV-3 seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection and managing to recover.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6xj7dpvpvo

The Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire shared the result of its largest survey of woodland nature reserves. Of almost 6,000 trees surveyed, it found that 29% had diseases while 82% of ash trees, the worst affected species, were suffering from ash dieback fungal disease. Josh Hellon, monitoring and research manager at the trust, said the results were ""very worrying"". The trust's Woodland Condition Monitoring Survey began in 2021 and as of this year has covered 21 different sites. Teams identify all the trees within a sample area and record everything health related from the girth to the wildflowers on the woodland floor around the tree. ""This is the biggest assessment of the health of the woodlands in our patch we've ever undertaken, and the results are very worrying,"" Mr Hellon explained. ""Our conservation teams are getting very used to managing the impacts of ash dieback and other tree diseases, and these results show the stark numbers we're dealing with. ""Ash dieback is having the biggest impact, with 100% of surveyed ash trees infected in some woodlands."" Ash dieback was first discovered in the UK in 2012 and has continued to spread over the past 13 years. According to the Wildlife Trust it has already caused ""widespread damage"" in Europe and has led to thousands of tree deaths in the UK. Mr Hellon said teams were trialling new techniques to manage affected sites and change the way they work. This included spraying deer repellent on saplings, removing affected trees, tackling waterlogging and trampling of wild flowers, and comparing different management options for ash dieback.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98ng24q3ero
2025-12-02,Death toll in Indonesia floods passes 600,science,BBC,"The death toll in the floods which struck Indonesia last week has now climbed to 631 on Tuesday, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas. The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.5 million people, according to the government's disaster agency. Nearly 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured. Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths. In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies. About one million people have been evacuated, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said. Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the flood waters had been ""like a tsunami"". ""According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,"" Amalia said. Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles. Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high. At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where flood waters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son. ""Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?"" she said. ""Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more."" Many are still waiting for food aid, with some saying they have not eaten for two to three days. Maysanti, who lives in Central Tapanuli which is one of the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, told the BBC that aid workers were having trouble reaching her district. ""Everything is gone; our food supplies are running out. We can't eat,"" she said. ""Even instant noodles are being fought over now. Our food is gone; we need food and rice. Access to us is completely cut off."" She said she has to walk kilometres away from her house to get an internet connection and basic necessities, like clean water. In Central Aceh where local authorities have provided Starlink devices, thousands were seen queuing outside the regency's office on Sunday night hoping to contact their loved ones or charge their mobile phones. ""It's been five days with no signal. We've been waiting since yesterday in case the network comes back. I'm planning to call my mother in Banda Aceh, but until now I still can't reach her,"" said one resident called Mar. As rescue efforts continue, anger has started to grow towards the government's disaster response. Critics say that authorities were ill-prepared for the floods. Some have blamed bureaucratic red tape for slowing down the distribution of food aid. Some activist groups have also claimed that environmental mismanagement, including the clearing of land for mining and agriculture, worsened the impact of the floods. On Monday, President Prabowo Subianto - who was visiting some of the flood affected areas in North Sumatra - acknowledged some roads were still cut off, but added ""we're doing everything we can to overcome difficulties"". ""We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity,"" he continued. ""Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this."" Across South and South East Asia, about 1,200 people have been killed in the last week in flooding and landslides. In Sri Lanka, at least 390 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176. However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame. According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land. In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations. That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days. In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop. In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding. It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4enlp6kzo

So far over £2m has been raised to buy the swathe of land known as giant's lair, which also includes Giant Hill, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The fundraising effort is being supported by actor and writer Sir Stephen Fry and Countryfile and TV presenter Sean Fletcher. The trust hopes to raise the funds by the end of January 2026. Standing at 180ft (55m) tall, the Cerne Giant is sculpted into the chalk hillside above Cerne Abbas. The giant was given to the National Trust in 1920. Giant Hill, is home to 36 butterfly species. Sir Stephen said: ""This is a very rare opportunity to protect a huge swathe of beautiful and biodiverse countryside surrounding the Cerne Abbas Giant."" The trust said purchasing the land would allow the charity to restore and care for sections of chalk grassland, plant new woodland, and create habitats to support species under threat. National Trust manager for West Dorset & Cranborne Chase Hannah Jefferson said: ""This is an exciting and unique opportunity to give nature a huge boost in Dorset. ""The land we're acquiring is extraordinary - it's home to everything from our huge 55metre Anglo-Saxon chalk figure to a small butterfly with a three-centimetre wingspan.

2025-12-04,Fracking firm denied more time to restore site,science,BBC,"An energy firm has been refused more time to put its former fracking site in Lancashire - what was one of only two shale gas wells in the UK - back to farmland. Cuadrilla had applied to Lancashire County Council for an extra two years to restore the Preston New Road site, near Blackpool. Members of the development control committee unanimously voted to reject the request after hearing from a number of speakers, all opposed to any extension. Cuadrilla has been approached by the BBC for comment. The site was the country's first horizontal fracking site but after more than 120 tremors were recorded during drilling the process was suspended, most recently in 2022 by the then government. Fracking saw protests from environmentalist groups and local communities, which welcomed the refusal of the extension, calling it a ""good result"". In its application, Cuadrilla asked for ""further time for the Environment Agency groundwater permit surrender process to be completed and then for the site restoration works to be carried out"". It had been granted a previous extension until June this year, a deadline that was missed with the meeting hearing that work to plug two wells only took place in spring. During the debate, committee member Adrian Owens from the Our West Lancashire Party said the company had ""not demonstrated good faith."" He said: ""When they came for a two-year extension, you would have thought they had everything lined up, ready to go, the moment they got that approval in 2023 to start the required work and monitoring, they hadn't done any of that, if we gave them the extension, it would be an excuse to delay still further."" Reform UK county councillor Clive Balchin told the debate he had ""some sympathy"" for Cuadrilla. But, he went on to say, he was ""a rules is rules man"" and believed ""residents affected by applications should not be disadvantaged or ignored by the county council."" Conservative county councillor John Singleton also spoke at the meeting against granting an extension and afterwards said he ""was very pleased, I think it's common sense, if the extension was applied, I firmly believe there would be another one two years later."" Nick Danby, from Frack Free Lancashire, gave a cautious welcome and said: ""I'm not going to be jubilant about it until the site is actually restored, this is a good result and we're very pleased about it."" Helen Rimmer, of Friends of the Earth, also welcomed the result. ""We're pleased the council has rejected Cuadrilla's attempt to delay clean-up of this former fracking site - but it should have been forced to restore this land to agricultural use long ago. ""Lancashire County Council must now take enforcement action and instruct Cuadrilla to restore the site immediately, in accordance with monitoring requirements."" The practice of fracking has been suspended numerous times over the last few decades, most recently in 2022, over concerns about earthquakes and environmental impacts. In October, the government said it was Cuadrilla can appeal against the decision.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23em59nn35o

Katrina Simmons, who lives in Carnforth, 4.8 miles (7.7km) from the suspected epicentre, said she was woken in the night by the tremors. ""The shaking woke me up, I thought someone had driven into the house,"" she said. ""It was about 25 to 12 and I jumped straight out of bed. I live on my own so it gave me a hell of a scare,"" the Spar shop assistant added. ""It was only when I went on Facebook this morning I realised it was an earthquake. ""A customer this morning said all the emergency services were on standby at Aldi, at that time they thought it might have been an explosion. Someone said they could hear a helicopter circling."" The quake occurred just off the coast of Silverdale at a depth of 1.86 miles, data suggested. There were no immediate reports of damage. Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said ""many residents felt or heard a loud bang"" in the area of Carnforth. Lancaster police also said it had received reports of a ""loud explosion"" in the area. Ms Simmons' colleague, Clare Hailes, from North Lancaster, said the force of the tremor set the shop's alarm off. ""I know the general manager got a call in the middle of the night because it set the alarms off,"" she said. ""Customers have been talking about it all morning. They thought a lorry had crashed into a building or there had been a quarry explosion. No-one was expecting it to be an earthquake."" Lancashire Police said there had been a ""minor earthquake in the area, near to the Lancashire and Cumbria border, measuring 3.3 magnitude"". It added: ""There have been no reports of anyone injured or damage caused but we have officers in the area, together with colleagues from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service."" The Volcano Discovery website said it had received more than 1,000 reports about the earthquake, with some as far away as Blackpool. One Carnforth resident posted on the site: ""Heard a rumbling sound which intensified in to a loud bang. Thought my roof was collapsing or something! Very scary."" Another, in Silverdale, posted: ""Loud rumble and rattling of fixtures in house, as though something had collapsed or the chimney had fallen off. Significant enough to go outside to check.""

2025-12-04,Bid to build manure energy plant fails,science,BBC,"A food waste and manure energy plant will not be built following a decision by a planning body. Plans for the facility near Sedgefield were approved last December, but the case was brought before the government's Planning Inspectorate by developers after Durham County Council failed to give formal notice to move ahead with the project within the time expected. the inspectorate said the proposed plant's benefits would be outweighed by the ""very significant harm"" the site would cause to the landscape's ""character and appearance"". Teesside firm BioConstruct NewEnergy declined to comment. The Reform UK-led council said it was reviewing the decision. The firm had previously said the facility would process food waste and farmyard manure to produce gas, which then would have been purified into biomethane for the National Grid. Durham County Council had initially approved the plant but then never gave the developers the formal notice required to move ahead with the scheme. This was in part because local firm Knotty Hill Golf Centre had come forward to say it had been not been consulted over the plans, despite being nearby the proposed plant. BioConstruct NewEnergy then referred the case to the Planning Inspectorate over the delays over formal planning permission. But the case has now been dismissed, and it is understood the scheme will no longer go ahead, with the planning body arguing the plant would ""harm the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside"". It also said the plant would have ""moderate to major significant visual effects"" on the views from local footpaths, as well as Knotty Hill Golf Centre. The golf course's owner Dennis Craggs said: ""Now we can just move on without this huge worrying cloud hanging over our heads."" General manager of nearby Hardwick Hotel Tim Boyd said his major concern with the scheme had always been about its potential smell. ""We do a lot of outside events...weddings outside, we do music festivals,"" he said. He said the planning body's decision was ""fantastic news"" for the local area. Nevertheless, the Planning Inspectorate said the evidence it had seen suggested the plant would not have caused ""unacceptable odour emissions"" and was not one of its reasons for dismissing the case.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c246q27y26zo
2025-12-04,'Like first aid for manuscripts': Recovery work begins at Gaza's war-damaged heritage sites,science,BBC,"With pickaxes and wheelbarrows, dozens of Palestinian workers in hard hats and high-visibility vests are clearing rubble from the ruins of the Gaza Strip's oldest and largest mosque. The broken stump of the distinctive octagonal minaret of the medieval Great Omari Mosque and a few external walls are all that remain after it was targeted by the Israeli military during two years of war against Hamas. Since the US-brokered ceasefire began almost eight weeks ago, work has begun to clear and sort the stones, but actual restoration cannot yet start. Israel is not allowing building supplies to enter Gaza via the crossings, saying this is in line with the truce agreement. ""The challenges we face are first of all scarcity of resources - iron and construction materials,"" says Hosni al-Mazloum, an engineer from Riwaq, a Palestinian cultural heritage organisation. ""Then we're using primitive tools... and being very careful because the stones here are 1,200 or 1,300 years old."" In her cramped office nearby in Gaza City, Hanin al-Amsi has an equally challenging task as she pores over fragments of rare ancient Islamic manuscripts which she has recovered from storage rooms at the Great Omari Mosque's 13th Century library. ""Similar to how we perform first aid for people, we are doing it for the manuscripts,"" the internationally trained conservationist explains over a video link. Ms Amsi says a young man from her department risked his life to retrieve some manuscripts when the Old City was under intense Israeli fire early in the war. However, a treasure trove of early Islamic works was left trapped in the destroyed building. Since a previous ceasefire in January that lasted two months, Ms Amsi has led a team trying to recover those manuscripts - with funding from the British Council, the UK's cultural and educational organisation. They began work moving the rubble by hand. While there have been ""catastrophic losses,"" Ms Amsi says, remarkably, some 148 out of 228 manuscripts survived. This was largely due to her pre-war efforts, working with the British Library to preserve, archive and digitise the works. They had been stored in acid-free boxes and kept in iron safes. ""Some pieces we recovered looked as if they hadn't spent 700 days under the rubble,"" comments Ms Amsi. ""But others came out looking as if a child had simply torn them to pieces."" To illustrate, she holds up a box of charred scraps covered in Arabic calligraphy. In recent days, Ms Amsi's team was able to use heavy equipment to uncover more badly damaged manuscripts. She says it is now clear that the library's archive - seen as an invaluable record of Palestinian history, with many Ottoman records - was totally burned. Palestinians accuse Israel of deliberately targeting their heritage sites - a war crime. Israel rejects that, saying it acts in accordance with international law. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) blame Hamas for the destruction of important historic monuments and collections, saying that the armed group acted ""in the vicinity of, or beneath, cultural heritage sites."" At the Great Omari Mosque, the IDF say they bombed ""a tunnel shaft and terror tunnel"". Unesco has verified damage to 145 religious, historic and cultural sites in Gaza since 7 October 2023, when Hamas-led attacks on Israel triggered the war. It has largely used assessments from satellite imagery. Local groups which have carried out ground surveys put the level of damage far higher. Gaza's history stretches back more than 5,000 years. Different civilisations have left their mark: Canaanites, ancient Egyptians, Philistines, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Jewish Hasmoneans, Romans, Christian Byzantines, and Muslim Mamluks and Ottomans. At another location in Gaza City's Old City, a team of young men is removing buckets of sand and crumbled mortar from what is left of the 800-year-old Pasha's Palace - exposing the geometric patterns of a mosaic floor. ""What is being done is just the minimum"" says Issam Juha, director of the Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation (CCHP), which is based in the occupied West Bank and is helping coordinate the work remotely. ""For even basic interventions to be done we need cement or lime mortar which is not available."" This historic fortress is where Napoleon Bonaparte stayed in 1799. In more recent times, it had been renovated and turned into an impressive museum displaying prized artefacts from French-led archaeological excavations. ""We are dealing with a building that expresses the identity and memory of the Palestinian people,"" says Dr Hamouda al-Dahdar, a cultural heritage expert who is leading the on-site restoration effort. ""We're determined to preserve what's left of this important landmark."" The IDF told me it had no information about why the Pasha's Palace was targeted in the war. Locals say it was hit by an Israeli air strike and later bulldozed. Trained labourers are now searching for some 17,000 artefacts that were kept at the site. Most have been crushed or looted. So far, only about 30 have been recovered from the rubble, including a piece of a Byzantine sarcophagus lid and pottery jars. The work being done is providing desperately needed employment in Gaza, with local cultural groups getting support from international non-governmental organisations. The Geneva-based Aliph Foundation has given $700,000 (£524,000) for emergency work in Gaza since 2024 and says its experts have near daily contact with teams on the ground. The British Council says that following the recent ceasefire, its partners are carrying out new damage assessments and safety checks ""to understand what future heritage work might be possible"". ""There are many archaeological sites that we simply can't reach because of the presence of the Israeli army,"" says leading Gazan archaeologist Fadel el-Otol, who continues to follow developments from Switzerland where he is currently based. He cites the Roman cemeteries and the Byzantine Church east of Jabalia camp, in the north - key locations where he headed excavations - which lie in the 53% of the strip still under full Israeli control. In Gaza City, access to the site of the ancient Greek port of Anthedon is blocked by thousands of displaced people camping there. ""We're unable to assess the full extent of the internal damage,"" Mr Otol goes on. ""No work can currently be done there."" Washington has indicated that it expects progress soon on the next stages of the Gaza ceasefire – dealing with thorny issues of post-Hamas governance, security and reconstruction. While Gazans feel there is still huge uncertainty about the future, many see the start of work at iconic heritage sites is being seen as a small sign of hope.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c157n1g977go
2025-12-04,What caused north-west England earthquake?,science,BBC,"When an earthquake shook homes in a small Lancashire village, those living there felt as though ""the roof was falling in"". The tremor in the north-west of England on Wednesday was so powerful, emergency services thought there had been an explosion and it was felt across the country. It struck at about 23:23 GMT, and registered a magnitude of 3.3, with its epicentre tracked to the village of Silverdale. Experts at the British Geological Society (BGS) said they could not pinpoint exactly how this earthquake happened. Because the quake occurred about 3km below the earth's surface, they said it was difficult to link it with particular fault lines that geologists have mapped across the UK. These types of quakes are caused by small movements on geological faults in the Earth's crust, activity which is unpredictable and not impacted by the time of year, the spokesperson added. In general, earthquakes are caused by The UK is situated within the Eurasian plate, more than 1,600km away from the nearest plate boundary, which is why it does not experience earthquakes as big as other parts of the world. Wednesday's earthquake was ""not out of the ordinary"", according to the BGS. In fact, the UK can experience several magnitude-3 earthquakes every year, with one being recorded Magnitude-4 quakes are less frequent, and occur every three to four years. Smaller earthquakes in the UK are much more common, with BGS recording 200 to 300 per year. However, only around 20 to 30 of them are strong enough to be felt, and most don't cause any damage. The BGS said the most recent earthquake of a similar size was in 2009, when a  3.7-magnitude earthquake hit the Morecambe Bay region. There was also a magnitude-2.9 quake recorded in the region in 1993. The largest known earthquake in the UK occurred near the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea off the coast of Yorkshire, in 1931. It had a magnitude of 6.1 and was powerful enough to cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England despite its epicentre being 60 miles offshore. Otherwise, centuries of observations suggest that damaging earthquakes in the UK are quite rare.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl9jp50gpwo
2025-12-04,GB Energy plan to focus on historical oil and gas areas,science,BBC,"Great British Energy (GBE) says its investments aim to support at least 10,000 jobs over the next five years, with a focus on areas historically dependent on oil and gas. The publicly-owned body, set up by the UK government, has been told by ministers to invest billions to accelerate the transition to green energy. It says it wants the transition to be seen as ""the great economic opportunity of a lifetime"" rather than a financial burden. But there are concerns that the rate of job creation may struggle to keep pace with the number of roles being lost in fossil fuel sectors. One study, from Robert Gordon University, estimates that a thousand jobs a month are being lost in oil and gas which would create a huge gap with the 10,000 being supported by GBE's investments. GBE has yet to formally confirm the future shape of its workforce in Aberdeen but last month revealed that only 15 people were currently based there. Creating a headquarters in Aberdeen was a key commitment by Labour during the 2024 general election campaign. It is still to secure premises for the headquarters and a workforce plan is being developed. But its strategic plan, which is being published on Thursday, commits to Aberdeen being its ""corporate backbone"" and that ""the majority"" of employees will be located there. It also plans to explore the option of creating ""satellite"" offices in other parts of Scotland. The strategic plan sets out GBE's priorities for the next five years. It commits to delivering at least 15 gigawatts of clean energy generation and storage by 2030. It also plans to create a ""toolkit"" to encourage more community ownership of renewable generation projects where the profits or savings can be reinvested into local areas. By supporting community energy projects and expanding public participation, it hopes to support 1,000 local jobs. GBE chief executive Dan McGrail said: ""We are proud to be putting public ownership to work, unlocking investment, powering communities, creating jobs, and building an energy system that delivers for the UK. ""This strategic plan marks a major milestone in our mission to accelerate clean energy and the industries that support it."" The plan also details an aim to invest enough public funds by 2030, to mobilise £15bn of private finance over the longer term. It also wants to use public land for wind and solar projects which would then generate income for communities.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39pxjdm7xno
2025-12-05,Doctor turned dinosaur hunter who rewrites history,science,BBC,"Jeremy Lockwood didn't play golf. He wasn't a fan of gardening either. So when the former Midlands GP retired after 30 years of medicine he needed something to do. Little did he know his chosen hobby on the Isle of Wight would help rewrite history. It was a fascination which began in childhood. Growing up Jeremy spend hours searching for fossil shells and trilobites – ancient marine creatures that predate the dinosaurs by millions of years. ""We lived in an area rich in prehistoric treasure,"" Jeremy remembers. ""As a small boy the prize was finding trilobite fossils. That sense of wonder never left me."" Jeremy was a frequent visitor with his own children to the Isle of Wight. It was his finds of dinosaur bones on the island which really sparked his interest and awoke his childhood curiosity. Taking his discoveries to the local museum he was told the bones he had found belonged to the same species. But his medical background triggered a recurring thought that the variation from a human point of view appeared too great. It was that observation that would change his life. To pursue his hunch Jeremy decided to study Paleontology at the University of Portsmouth. ""I thought it would be a good discipline to do a PhD. It would help me focus and give me the expert advice that the people supervising me would be able to give me. I'm not sure my wife was a hundred percent happy with me taking retirement and working 12 hours a day on a thesis."" Determined to test his theory Jeremy began sifting through thousands of fragments of dinosaur bones at the Dinosaur Museum on the Isle of Wight and the Natural History Museum in London. At first, his research focused on understanding variation within Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, a herbivorous dinosaur closely related to Iguanodon ""It seemed a good bet that there was probably more than one species of these. So I started sort of looking at the bones. Hundreds and hundreds of them – measuring them, photographing them and making a huge catalogue of virtually everything that had been found in the last 200 years."" While piecing together a skull thought to belong to Mantellisaurus, the former GP noticed something extraordinary. ""I was trying to reconstruct a skull by putting it all together to take a photograph of it. Once you got it into the right angle you could see there was a definite bulge – this animal had a bulbous nose."" he recounts. 'And Mantellisaurus, which for the previous hundred years everyone had thought was the only one, had a very straight nose. So this was clearly a very different thing. I remember calling in the curator of the museum and saying – come here – it's not just me, is it?"" It was a eureka moment. The first of three new species that Jeremy would go on to discover. It was Jeremy's medical background which drove his discoveries. ""As a doctor, you learn that human bones look remarkably similar. But in dinosaurs, I kept finding bones that were supposedly from the same species yet looked completely different. It was difficult to make sense of it all."" Jeremy's discoveries show much still remains to be learned about dinosaurs from the thousands of specimens sit in museum. ""There's so much material that hasn't been fully examined,"" says Jeremy. ""Sometimes, the most remarkable discoveries are hiding in plain sight."" Jeremy's forensic study of dinosaur bones continues. From sifting through the archives to studying specimens where it all began – on his Isle of Wight kitchen table. ""There are definitely other species out there and we're working on a couple of those at the moment. The retired GP's work has been recognized worldwide – his part on solving the puzzle of an ancient and diverse ecosystem. But come the winter months – there's just one place he'd rather be – on a windswept beach on the Isle of Wight. ""It's lovely publishing and writing. But there's nothing as exciting as being out in the field and finding something new.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e05205pvgo

The centre, in Lingfield, was founded by former dairy farmer David Mills, who was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2016. At 82, Mr Mills, who is Dame Judi Dench's partner, continues to lead the campaign to get everyone, especially children, to appreciate, respect and protect Britain's native wild species. He said England had the ""most depleted"" wildlife in Europe and the centre wanted to show people the ""wonderful wildlife we have in this country"".

The centre is home to a number of native species, including polecats, mink, stoats, weasels, red squirrels, owls, badgers, otters, foxes, harvest mice, deer and Scottish wildcats. Mr Mills said the ""devastating decline"" of Britain's wildlife was partly caused by a lack of spaces for animals to live where they were not in conflict with humans. He said: ""It's so sad, we need to make space for wildlife. Your garden is very important for wildlife and here at the centre we show you what you can do to encourage it."" The centre said one in six species was at risk of extinction due to factors such as habitat loss, climate change and pollution.

2025-12-05,Top UK scientist says research visa restrictions endanger economy,science,BBC,"One of Britain's most distinguished scientists, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, says the government is ""shooting itself in the foot"" with its visa system for science researchers. Sir Paul told BBC News that high visa fees are deterring early-career researchers, who are instead being welcomed by the UK's economic rivals. Supporters of the current system say higher visa costs help to fund the NHS and reflect wider public concerns about immigration. But the Nobel prize winning scientist says the UK's scientific future is being put at risk. ""Having expensive visa costs is shooting yourself in the foot. It absolutely doesn't help in attracting these sorts of people,"" Sir Paul said. Sir Paul, who has taken over as President of the Royal Society, which represents the UK's leading scientists, warns that countries such as China and Singapore are actively courting overseas scientific talent. ""Why do we put hurdles in the way of the people that are actually going to drive our economy? It makes zero sense."" The Nobel prize-winner describes the UK's science base as ""fragile"" because of a combination of steep visa costs, funding pressures and the negative signal, current immigration rules. He urges ministers to rethink a system that forces scientists to pay an annual NHS surcharge and to prove they have thousands of pounds in the bank before they arrive. Official guidance on the Immigration Health Surcharge explains that visa applicants pay the surcharge to help fund their healthcare. Home Office guidance states that applicants must show set levels of savings to show they can support themselves ""without recourse to public funds"". The Centre for Policy Studies, a centre-right policy think tank, argues in its report for net migration  to be brought back down to the ""tens of thousands."" But its policy expert on the issue, Karl Williams, broadly agrees with Sir Paul's sentiments, but argues that a tight overall migration limit must be maintained after an historically large recent surge in immigration. ""The wave of immigration we had between 2021 and 2024 is probably the single most significant demographic event in modern British history… If you say yes to one sector, then you start saying yes to other sectors, and you actually just recreate the problems of recent years."" According to Home Office visa statistics, the total number of people receiving a visa for a job in natural and social science in the last quarter was 323 people. ""Even if you doubled that, that wouldn't make a huge difference to the overall migration numbers,"" Mr Williams told BBC News. ""But there is no robust system to make that work, for example having conversations about where numbers can be reduced in order to let more scientists in"".

2025-12-05,Will we still be able to ski in Scotland in 2080?,science,BBC,"For many keen skiers, the Scottish Highlands has been their winter playground for years - cheaper and more easily accessible than ski resorts overseas. But guaranteed snow cover has become less reliable in recent years and the changing climate is giving those in the industry pause for thought. The number of days with snow falling in Scotland has dropped by between 25 and 30% since the 1970s, according to Met Office snow expert Alex Priestley. And he has warned that by 2080, there will be winters were we see no snow at all - even in the Scottish mountains. It could have a devastating impact on Scottish ski resorts such as the Lecht Ski Centre, between Tomintoul and Cockbridge in the Cairngorms. A favourite of snow sports enthusiasts since the 1970s, it was founded by entrepreneur James MacIntosh and today his daughter Annette Cockburn is at the helm. She grew up steps away from the slopes and recalls fun memories of having a ski centre on her doorstep - a winter playground of epic proportions. When the snow gates were shut, she would have the snow-covered mountains all to herself and of course every Christmas was white. She told BBC Scotland's Landward programme: ""It was great, this was my playground, we used to build igloos, go sledging, go skiing. It was a winter playground that not everybody had access to. ""You would think being here that you'd get a day off school if the road was closed, but no, my dad used to take us down to the snow gates to meet the school bus on a snow plough."" Today, snow is still front and centre in Annette's mind. Now though it comes with the perils of running a snow sport business in Scotland. This autumn brought a promising start, with cold Arctic winds during the third week of November providing a few days of decent snowfall. Wintry weather at this point in the year is not unusual, but the depth of cold meant Scotland recorded its , with the temperature dipping to -12.6C at Tomintoul. But Annette says the past couple of ski seasons have been ""very poor"". They would ideally be open from December until the Easter holidays. ""We haven't really had a lot of natural snow,"" she said. ""We've had teasers of natural snow, but it's never been quite enough for us to open a lot of our bigger lifts"". Last season was one of the worst - the ski resort only opened for one weekend with natural snow. While it has the ability to make snow itself, it is only enough to give a covering to a few of the smaller runs near the car park. And if the air and ground temperature isn't low enough, it's reluctant to stick around. Running a seasonal business is tough, and when the star of the show becomes ever more reluctant to appear, the burden becomes apparent. ""It's been a real challenge, we can't guarantee employment, we can't guarantee that we'll still be here,"" Annette said. ""It's basic survival to see that we can make it through to the next winter season. ""Poor seasons you get a little bit...give us a break, we need some snow. It's hard to say positive sometimes. ""Hopefully we'll be here [to stay] and we'll have a good winter season this year"". The Met Office's Alex Priestley said the outlook was concerning. ""We will still see snow of course, we're still going to see day-to-day and year-to-year variations in our weather,"" he said. ""But with temperatures going up and up, the cold extremes are going to be less cold and the warm extremes are going to be warmer. ""Unfortunately, for those us who love snow we're going to see a lot of less of it. ""There will probably be winters by the 2080s or so when we see none at all, even in the Scottish mountains"". Annette and others know that variability only too well. During the Covid pandemic there was , but no-one was allowed out to use it. It is a situation that is still hard for her to deal with now. While Annette says she understood the need to keep the population safe, she feels poor decisions were made by those in power, with regard to letting people into the fresh air and onto the slopes. Like many others, she is determined to carry on her father's legacy and build on the success of the past, but the long-term climate forecast is bleak if the industry is to survive in its current form.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39p0nvgglzo
2025-12-05,Renewable energy generation 'sliding backwards' as figures dip,science,BBC,"Renewable energy generation in Northern Ireland ""is sliding backwards"" an industry body has said, with the In the 12 months to September 2025, 44.2% of electricity came from renewable sources, down 0.3% on the same time the previous year. that has shown a decline in renewable generation, since a peak of The director of RenewableNI Mark Richardson said delays in policy and infrastructure reform were contributing to the ongoing decline. scheme was launched earlier this year, but the terms and conditions have yet to come before the Northern Ireland Assembly. Northern Ireland has a target of generating 80% of electricity from renewable energy by 2030. While less renewable energy was generated in the year to September 2025, slightly more of it came from wind - about 82.2% compared to 81.9% in 2024. Wind supplies most of the renewable energy in Northern Ireland, with the remainder coming from biogas (6.5%) and biomass (5%), solar (4%), landfill gas (1.4%) and other (0.9%). Mr Richardson said there was “growing concern” across the sector. “Quarterly figures will always shift slightly with changes in weather, but overall, the trend should be rising as we approach the Climate Act obligation of 80% renewable electricity by 2030,"" he added. “Instead, because we have no market support scheme in place, very few new projects are progressing, and generation is sliding backwards.” Mr Richardson warned with 500 days left in the assembly mandate, the clock is ticking. “The renewable electricity sector is ready with enough projects in pre- and planning to meet future demand,"" he said. “We can prepare for de-carbonising heat and transport, but we cannot do it while market security and planning timelines need to be addressed to stop stagnating as RoI and GB power ahead.” While wind and solar are familiar, the figures show the increasing role biogas and biomass are playing. Biomass is material like wood, straw and energy crops including willow, that can be burned to produce electricity, heat and power. Biogas comes from the fermentation of biomass in anaerobic digesters to produce . Landfill gas is primarily methane, produced by decomposition of organic waste. It can be captured and used to generate electricity. The REPG was launched in September. It could lead to reduced bills by providing support for additional locally generated renewable energy. But its terms and conditions have not been published and a draft bill has yet to be laid before the Assembly. With the first auction to award generation contracts under the scheme expected in early 2027, Mr Richardson said that, without “urgent action”, there is concern the timetable will slip. “The legislative timetable is tight, but all parties signed up to the target of 80% by 2030. ""The same cross-party support can ensure the support scheme goes through at pace unlocking investment in Northern Ireland as well as a secure energy supply.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9971dz82e4o
2025-12-05,Namibia loses bid to overturn ban on rhino horn trade,science,BBC,"Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting. The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated. Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries. Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino. Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour. Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted. Black rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report. The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago. Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International. In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows. Although this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past. Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years. ""Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,"" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC. ""Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much."" The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme. The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed. The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless. But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly. As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating. ""The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,"" said Mr Tench. ""Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised."" The governments of both countries have been approached for comment. Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts. Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures. But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching. They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues. Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN. South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30j7q6qjp9o
2025-12-05,East coast's water quality has 'improved hugely',science,BBC,"The Environment Agency (EA) said coastal water quality in the East of England had ""improved hugely"" over 20 years. showed all 35 destinations tested in the region met the minimum bathing water standards. Places recording improvements included Heacham, Wells-next-the-Sea, Hunstanton Main and Caister-on-Sea in Norfolk, as well as Holland-on-Sea, Manningtree and Jaywick in Essex. EA water manager Andrew Raine said swimmers should feel reassured but water cleanliness group Surfers Against Sewage said the Sandra Chant goes in the sea off Sheringham, Norfolk, which is rated as having excellent water quality. She said the water's occasional brown colour was down to sand being churned up. ""The only time we really have a problem here is when it's been raining, so it's all natural water run-off. ""The beck will just go out into the sea and that's where you can see there's a bit more of a brown sludge but after a couple of tide turns, it's clear."" Sally King, who also takes dips in the sea at Sheringham, said: ""Sometimes, you look at that water and it's blue, it's green. It is just fabulous. ""Years ago, I grew up in North Norfolk. There was a lot worse floating around then."" Andrew Raine from the EA said they carried out weekly testing, focusing on places where they know people swim and beaches with known issues like Heacham. He said: ""There is a public perception that water quality isn't great but the reality is, over the last two decades, it's improved hugely. ""But there's always more that can be done and we're keen to still push all those responsible; water companies, farmers, industry, to keep making those improvements. ""But the reality is, if you swim in any of East Anglia's seas and a vast majority of the rivers, you will find good-quality water"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzv0k1dn4o

2025-12-05,Spike in calls to firefighters 'linked to weather',science,BBC,"Firefighters in Staffordshire were called out to about 1,000 more incidents this spring and summer - a spike that is being linked to the hot, dry weather. The county's fire and rescue service responded to 5,409 calls between April and September, compared to 4,436 during the same six-month period last year. The situation was said to be driven by a 68.1% rise in secondary fires, which include most grass blazes that do not require a major response. An increasing number of wildfires in Staffordshire was evidence ""climate change is real"", chief fire officer Rob Barber stated. Over the six-month period, the service attended 1,794 secondary fires, which are generally small outdoor fires not involving people or property. During a publicly-held performance meeting on Wednesday, the service's commissioner Ben Adams quizzed senior fire officers over the operational impact of the calls increase. Mr Barber said while the surge affected response times, firefighters still arrived at 79% of incidents within standard time limits, against a target of 80%. Demand peaked in August, with firefighters responding to more than 1,000 incidents and the average response time hitting 11 minutes 32 seconds, up from nine minutes 55 seconds in August 2024. The increase in demand was said to also have had an impact on the service's finances, with a £400,000 overspend on pay being projected for the year, although the overall budget remained ""on target"". Mr Barber said there had been an increase ""across all of our incident types"", which was closely related to a hot, dry year, with the conditions beginning in February and continuing until October. ""The most significant area of change was secondary fires, such as grassland fires, refuse fires and fires in derelict buildings,"" he added. The service had conducted ""a great deal of prevention activity"" to try to reduce the likelihood of these fires, which included teams patrolling hotspot areas. But Mr Barber added conditions meant ""we still saw a number of secondary fires"" and this was ""a clear sign of climate change"". He also stated climate change was leading to increased demand for flood rescues. In other data, there was a 19% increase in road traffic incidents attended by firefighters, from 364 to 433.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg946rk1n0o
2025-12-05,Tons of medical equipment saved from landfill,science,BBC,"A scheme to prevent medical equipment ending up in landfill has saved the NHS £90,000, a local authority says. Durham County Council was the first in north-east England to launch a scheme of its kind, and said it prevented nearly eight tonnes of equipment from being thrown out in a year. Special containers are at 12 council-run tips, which have collected 4,300 items so far. Items people can leave include walking frames, crutches and mobility aids. The scheme was launched in 2023 by the then Lib Dem-led council. James Gilchrist, the authority's head of environment, said the scheme had brought essential medical items to more residents. ""Strong public support has demonstrated a demand for this service,"" he said. The items are collected by Medequip, the council's partner in the scheme, and loaned to people who need them. The equipment was safety tested and sterilised before it reached users, the council said. The now Reform-led council won an award at the National Recycling Awards 2025 for the initiative, in partnership with Medequip and HW Martin Waste.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5ly91lg4qo
2025-12-07,Rare micro-moths seen in county for first time,science,BBC,"A pair of tiny moths have been recorded for the first time in Hampshire. The two moths, the chocolate-brown Gelechia scotinella and Haplotinea insectella with shimmering scales were found at Pamber Forest Nature Reserve, near Tadley north of Basingstoke. Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust said the ""first-ever Hampshire records"" of the ""micro-moths, often overlooked because of their small size and difficulty of identification...had made county history"". The trust said the ""remarkable discoveries"" were made during survey sessions by its volunteer ""moth-ers,"" using light traps and attracting the moths to tree trunks with sugar. The charity said moth trapping sessions at the 214 hectare (529 acre) woodland reserve recorded a bumper 305 species in one session and had identified at least 20 new species for the site. Graham Dennis, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust reserves officer at Pamber said the reasons for the discoveries were varied. He added: ""Many of these new arrivals are spreading from southern areas due to climate change, while others are accidental introductions finding suitable habitats in Britain. ""We won't know for certain whether some of the rarer species will be found again, which makes every sighting exciting."" The charity said due to the large numbers gathered, several moths recorded during the sessions were still awaiting identification.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgr8935lxzo
2025-12-07,Memories of the night Storm Desmond caused chaos,science,BBC,"Ten years ago, Storm Desmond caused the worst floods to hit Cumbria in living memory. What happened then and what has been the impact since? By the time firefighters got into the house, the water was up to the disabled resident's chest - and rising. Sitting in a wheelchair in the dark, the person was totally at the mercy of the flood waters flowing through their Carlisle home that stormy night. ""That's probably the one where, if we hadn't have been there at that time, it definitely wouldn't have been a happy outcome,"" recalls Stuart Forrester, the manager at Carlisle East Fire Station, some 10 years later. It was 5 December 2015 and Cumbria was under siege. The rain had been relentless, inch after inch of falling water having nowhere to go on already saturated ground, swelling streams and rivers way beyond their bursting points. It was to be a long shift for Stuart and his colleagues. Where once cars had been parked between rows of terraced homes, now boats were needed to navigate the rising waters drowning the city's streets. And there was the permanent threat it could become a whole lot worse. ""We were behind the flood defences where the water was well above our heads,"" Stuart says. ""If that flood defence had gone, it would have been worst case scenario."" The crews worked quickly, going house to house to pull people to safety and get them to dry land. ""As daylight rose, it became apparent just how much of the city was under water,"" Stuart says. In some areas the floods had reached the second floor of peoples' homes, ladders being used to help get people into the emergency boats. With no food, power or drinking water, the evacuees were taken to casualty handling areas, away from the waters rushing through their homes. As the scale of the disaster grew, so too did the emergency response, local firefighters being bolstered by colleagues from other brigades and their equipment. Across Cumbria, some 5,500 homes were flooded along with 1,000 businesses and 600 farms. For many it was their third flood in a decade, with previous disasters striking in 2005 and 2009. But for most, Desmond was the worst. At St Lawrence's Church in Appleby, vicar Sarah Lunn points at a marker on the end of a pew, showing where flood waters reached in 2005. She lifts her hand about a foot (30cm) higher to another small sign commemorating where Desmond got to. ""It way over-topped everything,"" she says, adding: ""It was just the ferocity of it. ""It's that sense of absolute helplessness, there wasn't anything anyone could do. But as well as the drama of it, Sarah's memories are also awash with the ""resilience, love and community spirit"" shown by her parishioners. Almost 170 properties flooded in Appleby, many of which were businesses such as Bojangles Bistro. Owner Jim Chalmers reckons his cafe was some 5ft (1.5m) under water, with wooden floor panels lifted and heavy furniture such as fridges and freezers floating around. During Storm Desmond, the River Eden was the highest it had been in the town since records began in 1984, with water levels more than 5ft (1.5m) higher than those in the 2005 flood. The town had flood defences but they simply could not cope. Townsfolk and the Environment Agency hope they are now better prepared should a similar event occur. Some £12m has been spent on improving the town's defences, with a new pumping station expected to be completed next summer. Back at Bojangles, Jim, who is also the chairman of Appleby Emergency Response Group, details further measures residents and businesses have taken. ""We now have a written plan with trained volunteers who have all got their own roles in helping to prepare for a flood and become more resilient,"" he says. In Cockermouth, lessons learned in the 2009 floods, including the creation of a new defence built the following year, helped minimise the destruction of Desmond. ""Lots of residential properties flooded, it wasn't a good time, but it could have been a lot worse,"" says Jonty Chippendale, a former retailer in the town. ""It wasn't as bad as 2009 and some of the reasons for that were the work that was done after the 2009 flood to make Cockermouth more resilient ""The clear-up operation in 2015 was a well-oiled machine whereas in 2009 there were skips all over the place."" Now, the Cockermouth Emergency Response Group, which has some 200 volunteers, keep a close eye on the town's two rivers, the Cocker and Derwent. ""Floods in Cockermouth don't happen out of the blue,"" Jonty says. ""You usually get a few days warning if there's a big weather event coming and people take it seriously now."" The group has also created action plans to help residents in the event of a flood. ""We've identified the most vulnerable ones in the community,"" says Brian Mitchelhill, the chairman of the group's trustees. ""In the event of a flood, we send our volunteers to the most vulnerable first, then we start knocking on everyone else's door to make sure they are OK,"" he adds. Ten years on from Desmond, Stuart, the Carlisle fire chief, also feels his team is better-prepared for another flood. As well as improved equipment, they have also had extra training, for example how to use their boats in fast-flowing ""high energy"" water. ""So if those cars are getting swept into a river, or there are currents running through the city, we can use the boats to deploy and safely rescue people,"" he says. He says Storm Desmond was the ""largest and most prolonged"" incident of his career. ""Basically we were being redirected from life risk to life risk to life risk,"" he recalls. ""You can go quite a long time in your career without having to deal with that, but it's why people join the emergency services at the end of the day. ""We want to help people, but hopefully it doesn't happen again any time soon.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c208lve93gyo
2025-12-08,Campaign group formed to fight wind farm plans,science,BBC,"A campaign group has been formed to oppose plans for a major wind farm on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales. If approved, 20 turbines standing about 200m (656ft) high would be built near Stang Forest between Arkengarthdale and Teesdale. Residents said they launched Hope Moor Wind Farm Action Group to ""save the wildlife corridor and protect the skyline"" from the green energy development. A spokesperson for the wind farm project said the feedback from people living in surrounding areas was ""central to our approach"". Members of the action group claimed the wind farm would be visible for 75 miles (120km) away and seen from West Yorkshire, Teesside, Tyneside and the Lake District. Fred Olsen Renewables, which submitted the proposal, said the Hope Moor Wind Farm would generate enough energy to power 81,000 homes and businesses. It said consultations would take place throughout 2026 before the submission of an application in 2027. The action group said the proposed development would damage a landscape home to numerous rare and protected birds. It said the peatland was vital for storing carbon and helping to achieve the country's climate goals. The action group has more than 400 members on social media, according to the Suzy Wilson, group spokesperson, said: ""While the group supports renewable energy as a vital tool in combating climate change, it strongly opposes developments that cause irreversible damage to ecologically sensitive habitats, peatlands and ancient woodlands. ""The proposed site is thriving and forms a critical wildlife haven essential for biodiversity."" She added: ""Planning for the site has been ongoing for over a year, but there was a clear lack of engagement regarding the proposals."" Kelly Wyness, Hope Moor Wind Farm senior project manager, said further information would be shared in a public consultation opening in early 2026. He added: ""We recognise the importance and value of fully engaging with communities, but we want to ensure that everyone has all the necessary information available to determine their opinion. ""Listening to and learning from local people is central to our approach. As a family-run business, this is entrenched in everything we do.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl900d130ko
2025-12-08,Mosaic reveals the story of 19th Century sisters,science,BBC,"The story of two sisters who in 1861 brought back stones from Egypt for a church's mosaic has been unearthed during the building's restoration. The marble, granite, porphyry and alabaster rocks were collected by Emily and Anne-Louise Baily, aged in their 40s, during their tour of Europe and the Middle East. The mosaic for the reredos, the wall behind the altar at St Lawrence Church in Great Waldingfield, Suffolk, is currently being restored. Phil Judd researched the sisters with his wife Dawn. He said their trip was one ""that very few men had even done, let alone for two women, in the sort of clothing they would have had, lack of transportations and the difficulties in getting from A to B"". The Judds carried out extensive research into the lives of the unmarried sisters, who worshipped at the church with their brother, Reverend Waldingfield. The sisters ventured into difficult terrain, including to Wadi Halfa on the Egypt and Sudan border, ""which was an amazing aspect all by itself because very few men had even been able to achieve that"", said Mr Judd. The sisters were from a wealthy background and their relatives were lawyers, baronets and surgeons. They also made efforts to help the poor. ""They had food supplied in the local school for the school children, and that is something that quite often didn't happen,"" said Mr Judd. He added that ""finding out more about them keeps them alive"" and at first there was a dearth of material, until the recent discovery in the US of a book about them, which the researchers were ""still in the process of reading"". The sisters' year-long tour saw them returning to Suffolk with a small stone collection, which was sent to Rome to be shaved into thin slices to cover the church's chancel. ""The craftsmanship and the work that's gone into it, it's quite amazing,"" said church warden Christopher Francis. ""These different materials, these different stones, there's not a grout line between them, they're all intermeshed."" It was established the women only brought back tiny fragments of rock, ""about one or two millimeters thick"", reducing any chance they might be reclaimed by the country of origin, said the church's vicar, Reverend Faith Marsden. The mosaic started to fall apart in 2001, but funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Suffolk Historic Churches Trust meant work to preserve it could be carried out. ""A small Suffolk village that has an incredible story from around the world, not only is the reredos revived, so is its history,"" said Ms Marsden.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd6j9v0ne1o
2025-12-09,Cocaine widely detected in some of NI's major lakes and rivers,science,BBC,"Cocaine is widely present in the water of some of Northern Ireland's major lakes and rivers, a new study has found. Scientists found the Class A drug, and its by-product, in 91% of almost 140 water samples collected in different locations from five waterways - the River Lagan, River Bush, Dundrum, Lough Neagh and Lough Erne. Ketamine and amphetamine, two Class B drugs that are also used as pharmaceuticals, were also found as well as painkillers and antidepressants. Dr Billy Hunter, the lead author of the study, said it highlighted that drugs of abuse were not ""solely an urban problem; they are present right across Northern Ireland"". The research, conducted by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), in collaboration with Imperial College London, focused on raw water in rivers and lakes, not drinking water that comes from our taps. While there is no risk to human or pet health from interacting with the water, the study does raise concern for ecosystem health and reflects the extent of drug use in Northern Ireland. Dr Hunter told The State of Us podcast that while cocaine was detected in high levels in and around Belfast, mostly due to its population, he was surprised to find it was ""broadly everywhere"". ""One of the interesting things is actually the fact that it was showing up quite strongly in places like Lough Erne, which is maybe because it's a recreation hotspot."" He added that using future studies to monitor the water for drug levels will be important, with statistics showing that ""The population's ageing, people need more healthcare and the healthcare system is in difficulty so you have people taking pain medication to manage conditions for much longer,"" he added. While most substances pose low environmental risk, diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug, and caffeine were identified as presenting moderate to high risks. The study also found that an antibiotic - trimethoprim, which is often used to treat urinary tract infections - may be contributing to an increased risk of drug resistance, especially around the River Lagan in Belfast. The study looked at 137 water samples collected from 50 locations from Lough Neagh, Lough Erne, Dundrum, River Lagan and River Bush between December 2022 and February 2024. Cocaine, and its by-product benzoylecgonine, which can be detected in urine after using the drug, were found in 91% of samples. Scientists found 21 compounds in total, with tramadol - a strong opioid painkiller - present in 91% of samples, caffeine found in 80% and the antidepressant venlafaxine in 76%. While Northern Ireland's waters were found to be less heavily contaminated overall compared to other regions of the UK and Ireland, the detection of pharmaceuticals, personal care products and illicit drugs raises concerns for ecosystem health and human exposure. The study also reflects other evidence indicating the regular use of cocaine in Northern Ireland. In the year up to the end of September 2025, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) recorded more than 7,000 drug seizure incidents - cocaine was the second most commonly seized drug, after cannabis, with 1,353 seizures. Meanwhile of the 3,974 people recorded on Northern Ireland's Substance Misuse Database in 2023/24, cocaine was the most commonly used drug with more than half of those who use drugs reporting taking it. The study also detected ingredients and additives from personal care products such as cosmetics, toothpaste, deodorants and washing detergents. In terms of the risk to people and their pets, Dr Hunter said it was minimal right now though the presence of drugs in lakes and rivers could add to the cumulative detrimental effect on marine ecosystems. ""There is some evidence, particularly in England, of drugs having an effect on the environment. Some studies have shown that antidepressants are having an effect on shrimp in rivers and changing their behaviours, changing their dynamics within the ecosystem."" Meanwhile, he said it was caffeine that posed ""the greatest environmental risk in Northern Ireland"". ""If you think about what caffeine does, it peps you up, it raise your metabolism a little bit, it's a stimulant. ""If it's doing that to animals in the environment, they're going to be hungrier and more alert, their interactions within the food web are going to change because of that."" Dr Hunter also said the possibility of developing antibiotic resistance in the River Lagan area was ""definitely"" a concern. ""The risks around antimicrobial resistance are quite pronounced. That's a game where you come back to human health because if bugs are able to pass on antibiotic resistance in the environment then those bugs potentially bring infection back into contact with humans."" Prof Leon Barron, from Imperial College London, said it was encouraging to see water contamination in Northern Ireland was less compared to similar studies in other parts of the UK. However, he added, ""this was no reason to become complacent"". ""There are so many more chemical types used every day, and we should consider expanding our scope to include them. Importantly, we have demonstrated that we can use these powerful tests quickly and at large scale to catch pollution early.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r3vk8dvj2o
2025-12-09,Further remains of seven-arm octopus found on beach,science,BBC,"Further remains of an unusual deep-sea creature called a seven-arm octopus have been found on an Aberdeenshire beach. Arms with rows of suckers were initially discovered by a member of the public at Forvie National Nature Reserve at Collieston, near Ellon, on 30 November. Some detective work by conservationists led to the animal being identified as a septopus, a species with eight arms like other octopus - but in males one of the arms is also a reproductive organ that they More of the creature has now been recovered at the reserve - including its beak which is a hard mouth part used for crushing prey. Marine biologist Dr Lauren Smith, of East Grampian Coastal Partnership, said the seven-arm octopus would be carefully preserved and studied. Dr Smith said: ""The level of interest has been truly incredible. ""Researchers and museums are interested in genome work, stable-isotope analysis and preservation of the specimens. Currently they are all in my freezer."" Specimens are to be sent to the University of Aberdeen, Trace Wildlife Forensics Networks, National Museum Scotland and Natural History Museum London. The species live hundreds of metres below the surface of the sea and females, which are larger than males, can grow to 13ft (4m) long. Dr Smith added: ""There has been a lot of speculation as to how the remains ended up where they did."" She said theories included it was captured accidentally by a trawler and then thrown overboard, or killed by a whale. Another suggestion is that it became disorientated in shallower water and then was attacked by another animal. Forvie NNR covers about 2,471 acres (1,000 ha) of sand dunes and heath between the North Sea and the estuary of the River Ythan. The area is known for seals and also has the largest tern and black-headed gull colony in mainland Scotland.

2025-12-09,Is there a future for carbon capture and storage in Scotland?,science,BBC,"It's long been seen as a vital technological solution to dealing with our hard-to-tackle greenhouse gas emissions. But a catalogue of issues have led some academics to believe the Acorn carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) project in Aberdeenshire is facing an uncertain future. Technical problems in potential storage fields, the loss of two key industrial sites in Scotland and funding are all identified as stumbling blocks. One of the major stakeholders, Storegga, has put its share up for sale - but project leaders insist that should not be interpreted as a sign of wider problems. It comes as the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), has launched a fresh round of licence applications for storing the planet warming carbon dioxide in the seabed. The second licensing round offers 14 new locations in Scottish and English waters with a storage capacity of two gigatonnes of CO2. The Acorn project aims to decarbonise Scotland's high polluting industrial sites by capturing and transporting emissions using redundant underground gas pipes. It has long focused on Grangemouth and Mossmorran as the two main sites for capturing that carbon dioxide. But the refinery at Grangemouth has now closed and the chemical works at Mossmorran will follow suit in the new year. Prof John Underhill, director of the Energy Transition Institute at Aberdeen University, believes the closures mean the amount of available carbon dioxide from Scottish sites is ""much reduced."" He added: ""Storegga is now seeking to reduce its stake so that suggests that investor confidence in the project is not what it was. ""Done properly... there's no reason carbon storage couldn't and shouldn't work and indeed many of the other sites around the UK are optimal for CO2 storage. ""But in the case of the Acorn project, there have been geological challenges (and)  engineering challenges."" The Acorn project is owned jointly by Storegga, Shell and Harbour Energy who each have a thirty percent stake with the remaining 10% held by North Sea Midstream Partners. Shell said it is still involved and has no plans to relinquish its stake. Storegga has insisted that its decision to seek a buyer is nothing to do with the project's viability. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has also said it believes the decision has no bearing on the commercial viability of the project. A DESNZ spokesman added that it was ""working closely with the Scottish government and industry to secure a buyer and realise the site's potential to create thousands of jobs and drive industrial renewal in Scotland."" The identified storage sites focus on the depleted Goldeneye gas field, about 60 miles north-east of Aberdeen, which is already connected by pipeline to the St Fergus gas terminal in Aberdeenshire. Acorn then explored the potential of two neighbouring storage sites, one of which has been ruled out for geological reasons while the other has been reduced in size by about a third because wells were not plugged in a way that is suitable for CCUS. But Nic Braley, Acorn's general manager, said the areas they have identified still provide a huge amount of space to store carbon dioxide. He believes the project is vital to enable the decarbonisation of Scotland's industries and enable future growth into technologies like sustainable aviation fuels. He added: ""We can bring in revenues from overseas and we maximise the benefit of what is a UK national resource. So, I don't see failure as a risk."" Acorn says the now-closed refinery at Grangemouth was never regarded as a significant source of carbon dioxide for the project with the neighbouring Petrochemicals works seen as the much larger contributor. Dozens of other potential sites have been identified as a source of emissions with some even being able to be brought to the north-east by ship. Apollo Engineering in Aberdeen has diversified from an oil and gas company into low carbon energies, including carbon capture technologies, which now account for about 50% of their business. Like many in the supply chain, they see CCS as an important part of the energy transition and have been working on port infrastructure to send and receive shipments of carbon dioxide. Co-founder Ryan Menzies said it would be extremely disappointing if the Acorn project faltered and hopes CCS can drive expansion in his own business. He added: ""We have all the skills and the supply chain to do the necessary work and it's essential in achieving net-zero and maintaining the UK's industrial competitiveness."" At the government's comprehensive spending review in the spring, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced £9.4bn in capital funding for the first two CCUS projects in England. On a visit to St Fergus, the energy security minister Ed Miliband confirmed that £200m would be allocated to the project. Professor of carbon capture and storage at Edinburgh University, Stuart Haszeldine, said he believes Acorn is one of the best evaluated projects in the world but is struggling with the speed at which that funding is being made available by the UK government. He said: ""Clearly the developer wants to get out, or wants to find some more money to help it stay in the market because they've been really patient. ""Since 2016 or so, this project has existed in some form or another. What needs to happen is some of that £200m needs to be unlocked."" However the UK government says that money will not be made available until the 2026/27 financial year. It added: ""This is entirely normal, as this is when the spending period begins. It is not delayed."" The influential Climate Change Committee has calculated that CCUS is a vital component in the drive to decarbonise the UK by the middle of the century. Some environmental groups, like Friends of the Earth Scotland, have long argued that it is unproven technology which acts only as a mechanism for the oil and gas industry to continue 'business as normal'. For businesses in north-east Scotland, where oil and gas production peaked 25 years ago, low carbon technologies like CCUS and hydrogen are seen as vital for ensuring an energy transition does not create industrial wastelands. The Acorn project was so-named because of the visual to create 'mighty oaks'.

2025-12-07,Santa protest swim called off after sewage overflow,science,BBC,"A Santas Against Sewage swimming event had to be called off due to sewage in the water prompting an onshore protest over pollution instead. Surfers Against Sewage Cornwall had planned the festive event at Gyllyngvase Beach, Falmouth for Sunday to raise awareness of water quality. On Friday the campaign group said South West Water had released storm discharge into the sea and instead of swimming, it said supporters should protest on the beach.  One protester said it was ""ironic"" they could not  get in the water. South West Water (SWW) said recent heavy rainfall had caused Falmouth University students Jasmine Boniface, 20, and Verity Jones, 21, had planned to take part in the Santa swim but instead joined protesters on the beach. Ms Boniface said: ""We were planning to get in the sea and stand up for the fact that lots of people use the water and we need to be able to show how we feel about the pumping of loads and loads of sewage into it and making it unsafe. ""The fact we find out we can't even get in the water for the protest is so ironic."" Ms Jones agreed and said: ""It really just proves the point of why we're here. ""It's awful and it's shocking but at the same time no one is really shocked because that's why we're here."" Jess Morris, a regional representative for Surfers Against Sewage in Falmouth, said the original event had been planned as ""a really nice event to get in the sea and have a good group swim"". She said: ""I'm absolutely livid, I really am. This is the third year we've done this event and the second time we've had to cancel it because of South West Water."" In a statement SWW said: ""We are serious about reducing the use of storm overflows but change of this scale takes time, ambition and increased investment."" The company said it had started the installation of a new storm water storage tank beneath the Gyllyngvase Beach car park in October, which  would increase the sewers' capacity and ""significantly reduce"" the use of storm overflows. Ms Morris said the works were ""good but not enough is happening and it's not happening fast enough"". ""We need bigger infrastructure and huge changes and we need it now,"" she added. SWW described storm overflows as ""essential pressure-relief valves"" that prevent sewage backing up into homes, businesses and public spaces during intense rain. The water firm said storm overflows were a mix of surface water and sewage and rainwater made up the majority.

2025-12-08,Storm Bram alerts as 90mph gusts and heavy rain to batter Scotland,science,BBC,"Severe weather warnings have been issued for Scotland ahead of the expected arrival of Storm Bram. The Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for north-west Scotland which takes effect from 16:00 until midnight on Tuesday, with gusts of 70-80mph expected for a few hours. This could reach 90mph in some places. Storm Bram, which was named by the Irish weather service Met Éireann, is also forecast to bring high winds and heavy rain to the rest of Scotland. The Met Office has issued a number of yellow warnings for wind covering the whole of Scotland on Tuesday and Wednesday. Storm Bram is the second named storm of the season. which caused travel disruption and power cuts across tens of thousands of homes in Scotland. This time heavy rain could bring travel disruption in places, and there is a slight chance of power cuts and loss of other services to some homes and businesses. The Met Office has also warned of possible flooding to homes and buildings, and delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Strong winds could also cause delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport alongside buses and train services. Coastal regions could also be affected by large waves. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) They cover larges parts of Scotland, including Argyll and Bute, Orkney, Western Isles, Tayside and Dumfries and Galloway. Sepa said there was a risk of coastal flooding on Tuesday due to a combination of very strong winds, a storm surge and spring tides. It said heavy and persistent rain could cause some minor flooding impacts from smaller rivers and surface water. BBC Scotland senior weather presenter Kirsteen Macdonald said a spell of very high winds and heavy rain had been forecast a large area of the west coast. ""These winds will be disruptive to transport and travel, with the risk of power cuts and large waves bringing coastal flooding,"" she said. ""Heavy rain will accompany these high winds and may exacerbate impacts."" The presenter said yellow wind warnings had been issued for other parts of Scotland. She added that some places covered by the yellow warning for heavy rain could have 20-30mm - about an inch - of rain with most of it falling in a four to six-hour period. ""Some places over high ground may see up to 40mm of rain,"" said Ms Macdonald. ""This will lead to very poor travelling conditions from surface water and spray, as well as the risk of localised flooding."" She said the conditions were expected to ease during Wednesday. West coast ferry operator CalMac has warned customers to expect cancellations and delays. Network Rail said passengers should check their journeys before travelling. It said speeds would be reduced on some routes for safety reasons. Route director Ross Moran said: ""Storm Bram is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain, which could disrupt the railway. ""Our top priority is keeping passengers and staff safe, and we're already working hard behind the scenes to prepare."" Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said challenging weather was expected. She added: ""The Met Office warnings show high winds will impact the whole country, particularly in parts of the north-west and Western Isles covered by the amber warning, so it's vital people plan ahead if they have to travel.""

2025-12-09,What's next for the old Bristol Zoo site?,science,BBC,"The future of a former city zoo has been debated for over five years and has recently come to a head. A judicial review challenging plans for houses and flats to be built on the old Bristol Zoo site was rejected last week. Zoo bosses are relieved they can move onto the next stage but opponents of the housing plans have vowed to keep fighting. A judge ruled Bristol City Council to build 196 homes at the site in Clifton last week. The society, which closed the historic zoo in 2022 and has been gradually moving animals to the new, larger Bristol Zoo Project site, said legal challenges had cost it more than £300,000 and led to 20 redundancies. A spokesperson for Save Bristol Gardens Alliance, which brought the legal challenge, said it was disappointed with the news and that they would continue to oppose the ""dreadful"" plan. Dr Justin Morris, the society's chief executive, said they were pleased with the decision but said campaigns against their plans have taken a ""toll"". The zoo's future has been debated for five years after bosses announced in 2020 they would sell the Clifton site and seek planning permission to create housing. Two years later, Bristol Zoo Garden closed after 186 years. Clifton and Hotwells Improvement Society (CHIS) successfully applied to have Bristol Zoo Gardens listed as a community asset in an attempt to stop houses being built on the land. The status gave CHIS the right to bid to own the site if it was put up for sale in the following five years. Plans were then submitted by zoo bosses to Under the proposals, the 12-acre site would be made accessible to the public for free and were to be built in the former car park. The Bristol Zoological Society said the proceeds of the sale will be used to develop its new home at the Wild Place Project in South Gloucestershire. Nearly 10,000 petitioners and 1,000 public objections urged the council to refuse the planning permission. Dr Morris announced at the end of 2020 the relocation was necessary to "" after a difficult time financially through the Covid pandemic. The society had struggled to ""meet the changing needs of the animals"" within the available space and infrastructure of the zoo in Clifton, he said. The chief executive added: ""This new strategy presents an opportunity to create a world class zoo that sets the standard for a modern, forward-looking zoo in the 21st century."" The planning of new homes on the former zoo site has faced plenty of opposition. Despite the dismissal of the judicial review this month, a spokesperson for Save Bristol Gardens Alliance said the ""campaign will regroup and continue"". They added: ""The proposal to destroy the former Clifton Zoo site with truly ugly high rise flats, car parking and a service road continues to be almost universally opposed. ""The Zoo Society seems to forget that over 10,000 people signed a petition against the development and over 500 made comments opposing the plans on the council planning portal."" The Bristol Zoological Society has exchanged sale contracts on the Clifton site with independent housebuilder Acorn Property Group. But it will not be able to complete the sale until planning permission free from legal challenge is confirmed. A spokesperson from the society told the BBC that any appeals on the judge's decision to reject the judicial review will ""delay the development"" of its new site. Bristol City Council has declined to comment.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d04ddkdzeo
2025-12-10,Power restored to 'vast majority' after storm,science,BBC,"Power has been restored to the vast majority of homes in Northern Ireland who lost electricity due to Storm Bram. The storm, which hit on Tuesday, caused major disruption with NIE Networks said a few thousand properties had lost power because of the storm, adding it expected remaining customers would have electricity supplies restored later on Wednesday. In the Republic of Ireland, about 8,000 homes, farms and businesses across the country remained without power on Wednesday morning. An amber wind warning covering the counties of Londonderry, Antrim, Fermanagh, and Tyrone ended at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday. ""Storm Bram caused a low level of damage to the electricity network across Northern Ireland with strong gusts particularly impacting the areas of Downpatrick, Newry and Newtownards,"" a NIE Networks spokeswoman said. Crews had worked into the night to restore power, she said, adding the remaining ""small pockets, particularly in the wider Downpatrick area, will have power restored by Wednesday afternoon"". The strongest gusts anywhere on the island of Ireland on Tuesday were recorded in  County Down. Speeds of 74mph (119km/h) were recorded at Killowen in the south of the county. At Orlock Head, in the north of the county, gusts of 72mph (116km/h) were also recorded. On Tuesday part of the sea wall at Rhanbuoy Park in Carrickfergus washed away due to the storm. Local residents told BBC News NI that the damage to the sea wall and the flooding were among the worst they have seen in the town in recent years. Gordon Kerr, who lives in Rhanbouy Park, said ""it was pretty scary because the sea was coming right over the sea wall and the waves were actually hitting my house"". It's not the first time that this has happened but Mr Kerr said this was the worst flooding in a long time and ""they're getting worse every year"". ""It's a lovely place to live in the summer but in the winter it's a nightmare,"" he said. Mr Kerr described how he is lucky that his house has steps up to it but that his garden was badly flooded and items like his tumble dryer and lawn mower which were in his shed have been ruined. ""It was quite an expensive day,"" Mr Kerr added. Stephen O'Flynn, who came down to the seawall with his son Rían Patton O'Flynn, said he has lived in the area for about six years and he has never seen the weather as bad. ""It's devastating for the local community with the effect it has had,"" he said, adding the area had been quite dangerous on Tuesday evening. Marty Neill, who lives on the Portaferry Road, on an exposed stretch of tarmac that runs alongside Strangford Lough, helped those who were stranded. ""We had three strangers sitting in our home last night because their cars had to be abandoned... three lovely girls, they didn't know each other, and their cars are just completely ruined,"" said Marty Neill. Mr Neil said authorities should be more prompt to close off the road during high winds and heavy rain in the future. ""It's only a matter of time before a car falls in on a stormy night,"" he added. Police said they closed the road as soon as it was deemed necessary. A Department for Infrastructure spokeswoman said the department had became aware of the deteriorating conditions on the A20 Portaferry road and issued information on social media and on Trafficwatch to advise motorists to avoid the area and to use alternative roads. The DfI carried out an inspection of the road, clearing the surface of debris, and it has now reopened to traffic. The DfI said investments, including 1km (0.6 miles) of resurfacing between Newtownards and Teal Rocks in 2025 had taken place. Kathryn Holland, who owns Orange Tree House wedding and events venue in Greyabbey. ""It was definitely the most aggressive water heights that we have seen, luckily we have come out relatively unscathed from it,"" she told the programme. In regards to the Portaferry Road Kathryn said she doesn't ""think it's coping with the kind of weather that we are getting right now"". ""We need some form of proper planning and potentially long term investment to go into this road,"" she added. The was also major disruption across the road, sea, rail and air travel networks. Schools were advised to be flexible on school leaving times, with many choosing to send pupils home ahead of the worst of the storm. In the Republic of Ireland, some 54,000 properties lost power on Tuesday, but by Wednesday morning that number had fallen to 8,000.

2025-12-10,Medieval settlement remains found at wind farm dig,science,BBC,"The remains of a previously unknown early medieval settlement have been unearthed during works ahead of an offshore wind farm development. Archaelogists said the site near Friston, Suffolk, once housed wooden longhouses that could have been up to 19m tall and 6m wide (62ft by 20ft). The substantial structures would have been home to a small community around the Anglo-Saxon period of 410 to 1066, research suggested. Senior project manager Matthew Ginnever said: ""The archaeological programme is already proving there is much to uncover about the history of East Anglia and its past populations."" The discovery was made during excavations ahead of along the onshore cable corridor between Thorpeness and the substation site at Friston. The wooden buildings near Friston were identified by the remains of post holes, MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology)-Wessex Archaeology said. They would have acted as social hubs as well as homes, with a central hearth for cooking and keeping warm. The settlement did not survive beyond the 1300s, but a modern right of way is aligned with the buildings - suggesting the footpath has been in use since at least the Anglo-Saxon period. Archaeologists are to explore when the village was occupied and why it was abandoned. ""These sites were always rural, but they were by no means isolated,"" said Mr Ginnerver, from MOLA-Wessex Archaeology. Other finds by the team of 90 archaeologists included evidence of Stone Age toolmaking, such as an axe head once used for woodworking, clearing land and possibly butchery. A flint arrowhead made between 4,000 to 6,000 years ago was also unearthed and medieval kilns likely used for pottery, ceramics, or lime were identified near Sizewell. ""We've discovered pottery associated with the 'Beaker folk', who lived across Europe in the early Bronze Age and brought new cultures and ideas to Britain,"" Mr Ginnerver added. ""This suggests locals were in contact and trading with groups on the continent more than 3,000 years ago."" ""We look forward to adding more details like this to the rich tapestry of East Anglia's heritage as our work on the project continues.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0k9jzwzrqo
2025-12-10,Underwater speakers could help protect salmon from seals,science,BBC,"Underwater speakers will be installed on the River Dee in Aberdeenshire aimed at protecting critically-endangered salmon from seals. Funding of £160,000 has been secured by the University of St Andrews to develop a new ""detect and deter"" system on the lower part of the Dee. The speakers will emit a sound that researchers say will prevent seals from heading upstream and preying on the salmon. to move seals back down the river were found to be ineffective. The technology has previously been used in the North Esk and ""results so far have been promising"", according to those behind the project. It is hoped the technology can be adapted to protect salmon from seal predation within larger rivers like the Dee which can cause challenges for current sonar technology. The Dee District Salmon Fishery Board (DDSFB) said numbers of Atlantic salmon declined by 40% this year when compared with 2024. This comes as grey seal populations - which are eating the fish in significant numbers - are increasing. Debbie Cooper from DDSFB said the technology was the ""latest in a protracted line of methods we have tried"", none of which has worked. She added: ""We are really hopeful this new detect and deter system that has worked in the North Esk could work for us. ""Because they are endangered we have to do everything we can to save them.

Scottish Borders Council's planning committee narrowly voted not to object to the latest application near the Eccles sub-station by Bishops Dal Energy Ltd. Donald Moffat, who represents Mid Berwickshire, said he had concerns about the use of ""prime agricultural land"". However, the committee agreed not to object to the scheme which will store energy from renewable sources to be used when it is needed. The area has become a hotbed for applications due to its proximity to the Eccles substation which is being expanded. The latest project would see 96 container-sized storage systems, a substation and fencing and new entrances put up. The final decision will lie with the Scottish government but the council decided not to make any objection by four votes to three. ""The local community is at the stage now when they think they have done their bit,"" said Mr Moffat. ""I object to the loss of good quality agricultural land and we have already lost quite a few acres. ""The local community is fed up and they don't think there should be any more BESS developments in their community. ""It's basically industrialising our countryside."" A council report said the development complied with national planning frameworks and the local development plan. It added that there were no material considerations that would justify objection to the proposal. It concluded the project would have some ""minor landscape and visual impacts"" and  any issues could be addressed by ""appropriately worded"" conditions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8w9l8g1zo

Monica's new home at Hoo Zoo in Telford was adapted for her after she lost an eye. It has low level perches and a cat flap so she can get in and out and means she can remain with her feathered friends. The bird has been at the zoo for several years but recently lost her eye after becoming ill. She had her wings pinioned by previous owners, meaning she is unable to fly. ""After losing her eye earlier this year she's adapted brilliantly, and we wanted her to have a space that meets her needs while also giving her friends a fantastic new environment to fly and play,"" said zoo owner Will Dorrell. ""She's got some low down perches in there, and she has even got her own little cat flap in and out of the house, so that she can still get in and still get nice and toasty warm when she wants to,"" said keeper Sarah Holt. Hoo Zoo has also put a deep bark mulch on the floor, so that she is able to scratch, dig, and explore naturally. Her food and water are placed at ground level while the other parrots feed from perches in other areas. As well as suiting her needs, the aviary was also designed to give the flock more space and more opportunities for free flight. ""Monica has been part of our family here for years, and she's an incredible little character,"" Mr Dorrell said.

The plant at Balaclava Bay, next to Portland Port in Dorset, could be used to make concrete foundations for offshore wind turbines and could create more than 1,000 jobs. The Crown Estate which owns the seashore needed for the plant has agreed to fund the £1.5m study and developer Morwind says, if it goes ahead, it will be the largest offshore wind port on the south coast. The area required for a manufacturing plant and new sea-facing port and dock would be about 50 acres (120 hectares) and would cost between £500m and £600m to build. The site is close to the location of a on land at Portland Port, that despite permission initially being rejected by Dorset Council was given approval by the government in September 2024. And in February Portland Port and Norwegian renewable energy firm Source Galileo off the Devon and Dorset coast that would be able to produce enough electricity for more than 3m homes. The developer says concrete plinths manufactured at a new plant would be transported away by sea, but there would be an increase in road and freight traffic into the port during construction. Morwind added that the plant, specifically designed to service the offshore wind energy sector, can offer ""700-1,000 metres of deep-water"" and ""50-60 hectares of high load-bearing quayside for manufacturing, marshalling, integration, and storage"".

A spokesperson for Portland Port said it welcomed the study, adding: ""It remains early days but this is an encouraging step forward and we look forward to working with Morwind and other partners to give this project every chance of success."" The study has been welcomed by Dorset Council and the local MP. Nick Ireland, leader of Dorset Council says it's a major step towards Dorset becoming a big player in the green energy sector:  ""Funding for the Channel Gateway Project is a major opportunity for the UK and will bring investment and energy to Dorset. ""We're working with our unitary neighbours at Somerset, Wiltshire and BCP councils through the Wessex Partnership to boost regional growth and with The Crown Estate we plan to support offshore wind supply chains, creating jobs, social value and economic growth for local communities."" Labour MP for South Dorset, Lloyd Hatton said it was all about bring back local jobs to Portland that were lost when the Royal Navy pulled out 30 years ago: ""In the 1990s the Royal Navy decided to pull out of Portland and the port therefore lost a huge number of jobs, and a lot of skills went with it as well. That was a devastating moment for both Weymouth and for Portland. ""This project is actually about trying to reverse the damage of those cuts all those years ago. ""What we could see, is hundreds of decent, well-paid jobs coming to Weymouth and Portland that local people can train and step into in the future."" Developers say it is not an application for a wind farm off Dorset, but merely a feasibility study into whether or not a factory and production site for turbine foundations and parts could be delivered at Portland. If approved it would take about five years for the construction phase and is unlikely to be operational before the end of the decade.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwylned5nxqo
2025-12-12,Mountain bike trails count the cost of Storm Bram,science,BBC,"A string of mountain biking and walking trails across southern Scotland have been shut due to safety concerns after Storm Bram. Forestry Land Scotland (FLS) is reminding visitors to check storm damage updates on its website before visiting any of its locations across the country. All the old mountain bike trails at Glentress near Peebles have been closed as well as the XC trail at Innerleithen. Walking and cycling trails at Newcastleton, cycling trails at Kirroughtree and Glentrool and mountain biking trails Ae, Mabie and Dalbeattie are all also shut. The new trails at Glentress are open, as are most of the downhill trails at Innerleithen. Also open are the Ponds Trail at Glentress, along with all the walking trails at Cardrona. FLS area visitor services manager Katie Jarvis said: ""There have been numerous reports of trees down over the trail networks. ""So we have taken the decision to close a number of them until they have been inspected. ""We appreciate that storm damage can cause some inconvenience for visitors but public safety – as well as the safety of our staff – is always paramount."" She urged visitors to be patient and give their teams ""time and space"" to complete their inspections. ""The latest information will be posted across our website and we ask people to have a look for these before heading out,"" she added. ""If out, observe any safety signage and direction from staff.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v1nvn3677o
2025-12-12,The nuclear power station on the front line of an election battle,science,BBC,"The future of nuclear power in Scotland is shaping up to be a battleground at next year's Holyrood election – and Torness, on the banks of the Forth, is on the frontline. The Labour government at Westminster has declared its intention to usher in a new ""golden age"" of nuclear. But the SNP government at Holyrood opposes new nuclear power stations and can use planning laws to prevent them being built – even though energy policy is reserved to the UK Parliament. Torness in East Lothian is the last remaining nuclear power station in Scotland. The imposing building fills the windscreens of drivers heading towards Edinburgh on the A1 and dwarfs Stevenson's Barns Ness Lighthouse in the next bay. It is run by EDF Energy and directly employs about 550 workers, with about 180 contractors also based at the site. During periods of maintenance, that number can swell to above 1,000 - providing a boost to nearby shops, restaurants and hotels. It provides significant employment to the town of Dunbar, six miles to the west – birthplace of the naturalist John Muir who's credited with establishing the modern day conservation movement. But the power plant is due to close in 2030 and there are fears about the impact on the local economy. Andrea McPherson, 30, grew up in Dunbar and works as an environmental compliance coordinator at Torness. She says the site makes a positive contribution to the local community. ""With statutory outages, we have about 800 contractors coming onto site for a good eight weeks or longer and they obviously contribute to the local economy (through) lodging, meals, leisure, gyms."" She also believes that nuclear power has ""a lot of future prospects"". Morag Miller, 32, joined the workforce at Torness a year ago from the oil refinery at Grangemouth, where she had been an apprentice. She says it is ""disappointing"" that there's not going to be a low-carbon alternative employer when the site closes, where displaced oil and gas workers like her could find jobs. But not everyone in the community is convinced that Dunbar needs new nuclear. Local potter Philip Revell doesn't believe ""expensive"" nuclear should be a part of the energy solution and that decommissioning will provide jobs ""for many years to come"". He added: ""Nuclear waste has to be looked after for, in some cases, hundreds of years, which is mind-boggling and nobody's come up with a solution yet. ""So I think it's a crazy thing to be doing, to create more waste."" Earlier this year, the UK government announced its plans in England and Wales, including smaller modular reactors (SMRs). Last month it confirmed that the first of those would be built at Anglesey in North Wales. Great British Energy Nuclear has been tasked with identifying other potential sites and reporting back to ministers by autumn 2026. Although energy is reserved to Westminster, Scottish ministers can use planning legislation to prevent new nuclear power stations from being built. It was the same tactic deployed when the Scottish government blocked fracking for shale gas in 2017. The government has said it will continue rather than ""expensive"" new nuclear power. Its policy was reinforced in a draft energy strategy which was published almost three years ago. It says Scotland's future efforts should focus on renewables such as the Berwick Bank wind farm which will be capable of delivering electricity to up to six million homes. The huge development will sit about 24 miles off the East Lothian coast, with the power coming to shore at Dunbar and Blyth in Northumberland. UK energy minister, Michael Shanks, said the Scottish government's ""ideological"" stance was ""the absolutely wrong position to take"". He added: ""Sites like Torness could be where we could site future small modular reactors of the future with the thousands of jobs and apprenticeships that go with it. The SNP's blocking that."" The Scottish Energy Secretary Gillian Martin reiterated that Scotland has a policy of no new nuclear reactors. ""Instead, we are focused on supporting the development of Scotland's immense renewable energy potential – which provide more jobs, are faster to deliver, are safer, and more cost effective than the creation of new nuclear reactors,"" she said. In East Lothian, council leader Norman Hampshire has asked UK ministers to draw up a ""characterisation"" of the Torness power station site in the hope that it could still be considered for a replacement. The process would mean commissioning a full independent survey of the site taking into account geological, environmental, infrastructure and community considerations. The Labour councillor says the closure of Torness without a replacement would be devastating to the community in Dunbar and across Scotland. ""There's a lot of jobs... and all of that feeds into the local economy.  So, if Torness isn't there it's going to be a huge blow and there's not the other jobs to replace these jobs here locally,"" he said. ""Although we support a lot of renewables here within East Lothian, both onshore and offshore, we know the wind doesn't blow all the time and when that power drops you need something to back up these turbines.  Nuclear is the only baseload that we have available."" He says the Scottish government's ban could be lifted if there is a change of power after the Scottish parliament election next year. And he added: ""If we still have a government in Scotland that's opposed to new nuclear, we will look to challenge that because energy is not a devolved issue."" SNP councillor Lyn Jardine, who represents Dunbar, says the main reasons for opposing new nuclear are the delivery time and the costs, as demonstrated by the Hinkley Point C development. The project, which will be the first new nuclear power station to be built in 30 years, is being delivered five years later than planned and is costing billions more than originally estimated. Ms Jardine said East Lothian would continue to be an energy generation hub for both Scotland and the UK. Work is already underway to lay a huge subsea electricity cable from Torness to the north east of England ""If we're looking for continuity, there's a quicker way of ensuring that energy is delivered and that's through renewables in Scotland. ""If you look at what's going in, in terms of renewables infrastructure, just across the A1, there's a range of opportunities there. ""I don't think we need both (renewables) and a new nuclear station,"" she added. The Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay said in April that the Scottish government's ban on new nuclear was ""bone-headed"" and pledged to overturn it with the consent of local communities. The Scottish Greens say nuclear has ""no place in Scotland"" while the Scottish Liberal Democrats say developers would need to demonstrate, beyond reasonable doubt, that the new technologies were ""effective, safe, clean and value for money."" Reform UK Scotland has not made an official statement on where it stands on Torness. But UK deputy leader Richard Tice spoke in Parliament a year ago of the ""foolishness of relying on wind power"" and a need for ""more nuclear fast"" including small modular reactors. All of that, and with the continued decline in North Sea oil and gas output, sets us up for a pre-election showdown on the future of Scotland's energy mix. Jobs and communities will be at the heart of it but so too will the cost of producing that energy. The UK has some of the highest energy prices in the world which are placing huge pressure on domestic and business consumers. It's a significant contributor to the cost of living crisis and voters will no doubt be looking for guarantees that how Scotland generates its electricity will put money back in their pockets.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e0vdye900o
2025-12-12,Fears grow that world's rarest apes were swept away in Sumatran floods,science,BBC,"An unusual silence in the forests of north Sumatra in Indonesia is worrying wildlife experts and conservationists. Here, in the mountainous forests of Batang Toru, is where they had always seen and heard the world's rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutans. But ever since Cyclone Senyar devastated Sumatra on 25 November, the critically endangered primates have not been seen in the area, conservation workers say. Their absence has fuelled speculation as to whether the great apes were swept away by floods and landslides. And while some believe the animals may have travelled to a safer location, a carcass found in the area, said to be that of an orangutan, is fuelling conservationists' fears. Fewer than 800 Tapanuli orangutans remain and any loss would have a serious impact on the species, conservationists say. Humanitarian workers told the BBC they found the dead animal semi-buried in the debris of mud and logs in Pulo Pakkat village in central Tapanuli district earlier this week. ""When I first saw it I was not sure what it was, because it was kind of defaced, perhaps because it was buried underneath by the sludge and logs,"" said Deckey Chandra, who has been working with a humanitarian team in the area. He previously worked in the conservation of the Tapanuli orangutans. ""I have seen several dead bodies of humans in the past few days but this was the first dead wildlife,"" he said. ""They used to come to this place to eat fruits. But now it seems to have become their graveyard."" Mr Chandra shared with the BBC pictures he took of the carcass, some of which show him with the dead animal. Conservationists working in the region believe it is of the Tapanuli orangutan, a species that was only discovered in 2017. The other two species are Bornean and Sumatran orangutans. More than 900 people have died as a result of heavy rain, floods and landslides since Cyclone Senyar ravaged parts of Indonesia in late November. Hundreds are still missing, with many villages in Sumatra completely destroyed as the storm swept across the island. Professor Erik Meijaard, managing director of Borneo Futures in Brunei, is now studying the disasters' impact on the orangutans with the help of satellite images. He said 4,800 hectares (11,860 acres)  of forest on the mountain slopes can be seen as destroyed by landslides - but since part of the satellite image is cloud covered, he's extrapolated the destruction figure to 7,200 hectares in his preliminary observation. ""The destroyed areas would have contained some 35 orangutans, and considering the violence of the destruction it wouldn't surprise us if they are all dead. That's a major blow to the population,"" he told the BBC. ""These areas show as bare soil on satellite imagery where two weeks ago it was primary forest. Complete destruction. Many patches of several hectares completely denuded. It must have been hellish in the forest at the time."" Prof Mejjard said he too has seen the picture of the dead orangutan shared by Chandra. ""What struck me is that all the flesh had been ripped off the face,"" he said. ""If a few hectares of forest comes down in massive landslides, even powerful orangutans are helpless and just get mangled."" Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre which works for the conservation of the primates in the region, said the carcass meant it was highly possible some Tapanuli orangutans were unable to escape as rushing waters and landslides swept through their habitat. Pictures showing the carcass of a Sumatran elephant, another critically endangered species, being swept away by floods in Aceh in northern Sumatra went viral on social media last week. The island hosts a range of endangered species like Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinos. But conservation workers say there are particular concerns for orangutans and other primates, like gibbons, because huge parts of the mountainous forest in the Tapanuli district saw massive landslides due to Cyclone Senyar's extreme rainfall. Some locals say the primates must have escaped before the disaster struck, as they can sense danger beforehand. But some primate experts say that may not have been the case. ""During heavy rains orangutans either just sit in a tree or gather branches and leaves to use as an umbrella and then wait for the rain to stop,"" said Serge Wich, professor of primate biology at Liverpool John Moores University, who has conducted research on Tapanuli orangutans. ""But this time, by the time the rain stopped it was too late: parts of their habitat - the slopes of valleys - were wiped out by landslides, which means there must have been consequences for them."" The recent floods have also damaged a number of orangutan research centres in Sumatra - including at Ketambe, the world's first orangutan research centre, in Aceh. Dr Ian Singleton, scientific director for the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme, said the Ketambe centre is now almost completely destroyed. ""It needs to be rebuilt as soon as possible so it can continue to play that role in protecting the forests in that area and its orangutans.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1l0ly7wo
2025-12-11,"Pollution row halts 11,000 new-build homes",science,BBC,"Thousands of homes are stuck in the planning system across west Wales nearly six months after new advice was issued on tackling pollution at sea. Environment watchdog Natural Resources Wales (NRW) wants building projects to prove they will not add to water quality problems in marine Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). Housing associations said it had led to a block on building ""urgently needed"" affordable homes, while one architectural firm forced to make redundancies warned of ""massive damage"" to the local economy. NRW said water quality challenges are placing considerable pressure on vital ecosystems and it needed to act decisively to protect them. The Welsh government said it had prioritised the issue and was urgently exploring all solutions. ""We've had in the region of 14 projects caught up in this - with over 500 units [homes] affected,"" said Nick Cox who runs an architectural practice in Pembrokeshire working predominately on affordable housing. He felt the NRW advice had come ""out of the blue"", leading to a freeze on decisions over planning applications as local authorities in west Wales grappled with how to respond. ""For us it meant a drastic drop in our workload... and we unfortunately had to make two of our staff redundant as a direct consequence,"" he said. The business would lose out on ""upwards of half a million pounds"" in fees over the coming 12 to 18 months, which was ""pretty devastating"", he said. ""But we're the thin end of the wedge in all this - you're talking about potentially in the region of £100m to £150m of investment and jobs that isn't going to come now or in the foreseeable future to west Wales,"" he said. As many as 11,000 new homes are currently unable to progress in the west Wales area, BBC News has been told. Community Housing Cymru (CHC), the membership body for Welsh housing associations, said this included more than 2,110 affordable properties, with around 800 of those at an advanced stage in the planning process. ""They're homes that we would have expected to see people living in in the next year or so but at the moment we can't move forward,"" said Rhea Stevens of CHC. Across Wales tens of thousands of people were on a waiting list for social housing, she said. ""So we have a housing emergency and essentially what we have now is a situation where in certain parts of Wales we cannot build the affordable homes that are so urgently needed"". The group is calling for a workaround that would allow affordable homes to progress through the planning system while longer term solutions to the issues affecting marine special areas of conservation are found. NRW published new assessments of the condition of environmentally sensitive areas along the Welsh coast back in June. They found that several sites were suffering from excessive levels of nutrients in the water, affecting rare species and habitats. They included the Milford Haven Inner Waterbody in Pembrokeshire and another protected estuary - the Burry Inlet between Carmarthenshire and Swansea. Environmental campaigners said the findings showed how pollution from rivers in Wales was now harming the marine environment and "" NRW's reports suggested the nutrient pollution came predominately from agriculture as well as private sewage systems such as septic tanks and the water industry. The result was that any new developments in the affected areas would have to show they would not add to the nutrient issues, or that they could somehow offset their impact, in order to secure planning permission. This affected most of Pembrokeshire, parts of Carmarthenshire and Swansea as well as an area of Neath Port Talbot and Anglesey, said Sara Morris, chair of the Planning Officers Society Wales. She said planning authorities ""absolutely understand the importance of water quality and making sure our most important places are protected"". But in a letter to the Welsh government she criticised the handling of NRW's announcement, which happened ""without appropriate pre-engagement... and essential supporting information"". ""The absence of guidance, source apportionment work, and initially even basic mapping for affected authorities is unacceptable,"" she wrote. She told the BBC: ""There are some routes through this... but we're probably looking at one to two years to get a nutrient trading scheme up and running that allows applications for large schemes to flow through more quickly."" A nutrient trading scheme would see developers pay a fee to offset pollution from new homes by investing in the creation of wetlands, woodlands or other measures that would help improve water quality. Wildlife charity WWF Cymru said the situation showed the need for a ""well-funded action plan"" on river pollution in Wales. ""We haven't really seen sufficient leadership from Welsh government,"" said Gareth Clubb, WWF Cymru's director. The government said it had established a taskforce with local authorities, NRW and Welsh Water which was ""working at pace"" to find quick solutions that would also contribute to more sustainable medium and long-term solutions. ""We are also providing additional support to affected areas, including more than £500,000 to the West Wales Nutrient Management Board and funding of up to £1.5m over three years to support local authorities to tackle nutrient issues,"" it said. Mary Lewis from NRW said the organisation had a ""responsibility"" to provide evidence on the condition of protected sites. Marine special areas of conservation were ""fundamental"" for maintaining a diversity of wildlife and habitats, and provided ""a whole range of benefits"" to society too - from flood defence to opportunities for outdoor recreation, she said. NRW's latest assessments had highlighted that some sites in particular were in poor condition which caused impacts such as ""oxygen level depletion and high growth of algae, blocking out sunlight"". Ms Lewis said: ""We moved very quickly to produce mapping and further guidance and are working at pace with those affected planning authorities to apply the assessment processes to understand what needs to be done to be able to look at those housing developments."" It wasn't possible yet to put a timescale on when housing projects would be able to progress, she said - adding it was ""always going to be on a case by case basis"". ""I think... some short term measures to reduce nitrogen inputs in other parts of the catchment... could be found to allow some of those developments to come forward."" ""Medium to long term we need to establish bigger schemes across wider areas of the catchment that will over the long term remove nutrients permanently [before] arriving into our rivers and seas.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjezd975e84o
2025-12-15,From Tolkien's favourite tree to a royal sapling,science,BBC,"For about two centuries, a towering black pine stood in the University of Oxford Botanic Garden, becoming one of its most cherished landmarks. JRR Tolkien loved sitting beneath its shade, Philip Pullman wove it into his fiction, and generations of visitors admired its grandeur. But in 2014, it was felled and came to what many described as a tragic end. Prof Simon Hiscock, director of the botanic garden and arboretum, reflects on its story and the hope now rooted in a sapling planted by King Charles III. ""There's quite a bit of mystery about the origin of the Oxford black pine,"" Prof Hiscock says. An Oxford-trained botanist, he later helped found the University of Bristol's botanic garden, the youngest of its kind in Britain. He now continues his career at the oldest one, in Oxford, which he describes as having been ""fun and exciting"". The species, he explains, is called Pinus negra and is widely distributed across central and Eastern Europe, as well as western Asia. ""Nobody quite knows where the seeds were gathered for the black pine that became so famous here,"" he says. ""But it may have been on a collecting trip, or it might have been from a prolific nursery grower of conifers at that time."" He adds that it could have been an experiment by the well-known Oxford botanist and chemist Charles Daubeny. Prof Hiscock describes black pines as ""magnificent trees"" that can grow to ""awesome proportions"". ""They often branch multiply from a low trunk and create this amazing upward array of arms that are the branches,"" he says. ""The black pine in he botanic garden was the largest tree in the garden at the time of its sad demise."" Initially thought to date from 1799, its rings revealed a later planting - probably in the mid-1830s. The tree inspired deep affection. ""It became a favourite of JRR Tolkien who visited the garden regularly and used to sit under the tree,"" Prof Hiscock says. ""There are some very famous photographs of him with his beloved tree."" It is also mentioned in Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. ""Philip was very fond of the tree and has since been very fond of the wood that we've saved from it and have used to make wonderful wooden products that were available at our Christmas fair for the first time [this year]."" The garden's Black Pine Collection features products such as writing materials and cufflinks. Prof Hiscock says he was told the items evoked ""quite a flood of interest, particularly from members of the Tolkien Society"". By the time Prof Hiscock stepped into his role in July 2015, the tree had already gone. ""My understanding is it split in two because the branched stems were so heavy under their own weight and they'd got so tall that it just suddenly split,"" he says. At the time, Dr Alison Foster, who worked on the garden, But a future black pine was planted by King Charles III on 8 June 2021, in celebration of ""He was so interested to learn about various trees and other plants,"" Prof Hiscock says. ""He planted a sapling grown from a seed that had been collected from the original black pine."" He adds that he was ""impressed"" by how much the King knows about plants, trees and woodland crafts. ""I've written to him a number of times since and met him a couple of times since, and he's always interested to know how his tree is doing,"" the professor says. The young tree grows just a few feet away from where the original was, with ""a magnificent view"" of the Great Tower of Magdalen College. ""It's within a part that we call the Literary Garden because it details plants that are associated with English literature mainly, and often authors, poets, writers from Oxford,"" Prof Hiscock says. He adds that it is about 20ft (6m) tall now, meaning it is growing ""very, very quickly"". ""It's in what you might call juvenile phase at the moment, so it looks like a big Christmas tree. ""That will all change as it continues its development and starts to branch out. ""But in 100 years it'll start looking really good.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2543z3157o
2025-12-16,First water voles spotted in river in decades,science,BBC,"A conservation team has confirmed sightings of Britain's fastest-declining mammal, the water vole, in a river's catchment area for the first time in nearly 20 years. River Thame Conservation Trust (RTCT) volunteers captured video evidence of the species at two sites - on the River Thame near Chearsley, Buckinghamshire, and another on the Chalgrove Brook in Stadhampton, Oxfordshire. The footage was gathered using motion-sensor wildlife cameras placed across the catchment area and is part of the trust's long-running monitoring project to detect signs of water voles and other key river species. RTCT said that was ""sparking hope for the species' recovery in the catchment"". The trust said the first sighting had come in the form of a ""dramatic"" video clip at the Chearsley site. It shows a heron on the riverbank catching and eating two water voles. ""While the footage was not nice to watch, it was also an exciting discovery, evidence of previously undetected water voles in the Thame catchment,"" RTCT said. It said herons presence alongside water voles signalled that the river ""is once again able to support a healthy, functioning food web"". A different volunteer captured footage of a water vole swimming away from a mink monitoring raft deployed on the Chalgrove Brook, confirming that at least one animal there was alive and active. Paul Jeffery, RTCT volunteer and Oxon Mammal Group treasurer, said regular ""visitors"" included a brown rat, wood mice and two otters. ""But one evening, a thousand clips later, I stopped - 'what was that?' The face was more blunt than a rat, the ears and eyes not quite right. ""Confirmed the next day, it was indeed a water vole, moving upstream at 01:00."" Mr Jeffery said that brought ""real hope that water voles are still clinging on and may one day repopulate the whole river system with our continued help"". by more than 90% since the 1990s. Water voles were once a common sight along Britain's rivers, streams and wetlands before vanishing from 94% of former sites. RTCT's Hilary Phillips said the recent findings were ""a fantastic affirmation of all the hard work by volunteers and landowners that our combined efforts are making a difference"". The trust said that in the River Thame catchment, the last confirmed records of surviving water voles dated back to the early 2000s, but populations were known to be dwindling at that time. In an attempt to boost their numbers, a reintroduction effort was carried out near Cuddesdon and Chiselhampton in 2006. RTCT said it was not known whether the recently discovered specimens were from the reintroduced voles or the remnants of native populations. It encourages members of the public to report any sightings of water voles and signs of American mink to local conservation groups or through national invasive species platforms such as INNS Mapper.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r9jzq7p4wo
2025-12-14,House martin nest cups offered to combat decline,science,BBC,"Homeowners, schools and businesses are being offered the chance to install artificial nests to help reverse the decline in house martin numbers. The distinctive dark blue and white birds, which migrate from Africa each spring, are on the UK's Red List of endangered bird species. The Hampshire House Martins Project is offering free so-called nest cups, which save the birds time and energy compared to building their own mud nests. Nigel Matthews from the group said people ""loved helping"" the birds. Earlier this year, the Hampshire Ornithological Society initiative launched a survey, allowing members of the public to Mr Matthews said it showed some ""fascinating"" results, with more than 500 nest sites submitted. ""Some people said they had seen them for years, but had now seen a decline,"" he said. ""But there were quite a few in new housing estates where perhaps there is still some bare mud available and they are managing to nest. ""They like to get right up into tall gables and that particular preference came across."" A new survey with volunteers counting nest sites in sample square kilometres around the county is planned for next year. Each April and May, house martins return from Africa to spend the summer in the UK. They catch flying insects on the wing and build cup-shaped nests with mud under the eaves of houses and other buildings. The birds often form colonies with several nests in close proximity. The decline in numbers has been blamed on a fall in quantities of insects, as well as hotter, drier weather resulting in less wet mud available for nest building. Modern homes tending to have uPVC soffits also makes it difficult for mud nests to adhere. In an initiative funded by South East Water, the project is offering 100 artificial nest cups to be attached to houses and other structures for house martins to nest in. It is hoped that the wooden cups could save valuable nest-building time for the birds, make their nests more robust and boost breeding success. The group is asking members of the public who live near established house martin sites to volunteer to host a nest cup, which would be installed by experts. ""There is a high amount of goodwill towards these birds. People love having them and want to help a bird that nationally is declining,"" Mr Matthews added. ""It's good to be able to give people the tools to help."" Applications for the nest cups can be made on the They are available to anyone in areas of Hampshire served by South East Water whose property is suitable and meets the necessary criteria of being less than 500m away from an established nesting site.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87lyqw2eleo
2025-12-15,Christmas bin collection dates announced,science,BBC,"Changes to bin collection days over Christmas and new year in Hull have been announced. Hull City Council has urged residents to check what day they need to put their bins out for collection. The authority also announced the city's household waste and recycling centres would be closed on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Councillor Charles Quinn, portfolio holder for environment, said: ""Bin collections over Christmas and new year are slightly different, so to ensure bins are emptied, everyone should check their calendars to make sure they put their bins out on the right days."" The festive schedule is as follows: Normal collection dates resume on Tuesday 13 January. The council said the festive season was a time when household waste typically increased by about a third and urged residents to cut down on food waste and recycle. Quinn added: ""With all the extra food, packaging and wrapping at Christmas, it's easy for waste to pile up. But most of it can be recycled, and a lot of food waste can be avoided altogether. ""This Christmas, we're asking everyone to plan meals carefully, use up leftovers and make sure any unavoidable food waste goes in the brown bin."" Any excess waste can be taken to one of the city's three household waste and recycling centres, where many unwanted items can also be donated for sale in Reuse shops, the council said. Real Christmas trees can be recycled by being chopped up and put in the brown bin, or taken whole to one of the centres at Burma Drive, Sutton Fields and Wiltshire Road.

2025-12-13,Why do sea creatures end up on beaches after storms?,science,BBC,"Seal pups and jellyfish-like creatures are among the wildlife washed up on Dorset's beaches during storms this week. Thousands of by-the-wind-sailors - organisms carried by ocean currents and the wind - were reported in Poole Bay and Kimmeridge. Seal pups have also been washed ashore in recent days, with part of Weymouth beach temporarily cordoned off on Wednesday to ensure one of them could return to the sea, undisturbed. So what happens to marine wildlife when there's a storm and why do creatures end up on our beaches? British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said it had received reports of eight seals needing assistance since the start of December. On Monday, a member of the public reported another tiny seal pup amongst piles of rubbish at Seatown. The charity said the seal was found ""underweight, exhausted and surrounded by debris with nowhere safe to rest"". It was taken to RSPCA West Hatch Animal Centre in Somerset for rehabilitation and will eventually be released back into the wild. A BDMLR spokesperson said: ""After storms and high tides, seals often haul out to rest, digest and recover. ""For very young pups, rough seas can also separate mother and pup or displace pups from sheltered pupping areas. ""In many cases, the mother is still nearby and will return to feed when undisturbed. ""If there are disturbance issues, the mother may abandon the pup altogether."" The charity said its approach was to reduce disturbance and monitor pups until they were united with their mothers. But it said if they were unwell or repeatedly approached by people and dogs and there was no sign of their mother, they may rescue the pup for veterinary care and rehabilitation. Some dog walkers expressed concern after discovering hundreds of by-the-wind-sailors washed up on beaches after Storm Bram. Sarah Hodgson of Dorset Wildlife Trust said: ""By-the-wind sailors are usually found out in the open ocean. They live on the surface of the sea, travelling with the currents and using their sail-like structure to drift with the wind. ""It's not unusual for mass strandings to occur after rough and stormy weather, where the strong winds push them closer towards the coast.

2025-12-14,Red post box sent to Antarctic - on King's orders,science,BBC,"A shiny new red post box has been given as a gift from King Charles III to staff at a remote Antarctic research station. The Royal Mail lamp post box was sent to staff at the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey station at Rothera. The box, featuring the King Charles III cypher, was delivered after Kirsten Shaw, a station support assistant who runs the British Antarctic Territory Post Office for staff, requested an upgrade to their handmade box. ""Being in Antarctica is incredible, but it's full of extremes, so I think it's a special thing to send post back home, to communicate your experiences. It's a moment of your life that you put down on paper and give to someone else,"" she said. The Rothera research station, which opened in 1975, is the largest British Antarctic Survey (BAS) facility, and a renowned global hub for climatic research. It is situated 1,860km (1,155 miles) south of the Falkland Islands. Staff work and live at the station for months at a time. Ms Shaw said: ""Getting post is really special for the team at Rothera. ""If you're doing fieldwork for many months, the feeling of receiving a letter — an actual tangible, piece of paper with handwriting from friends and family — is such a lift. ""It's a wonderful way to connect people that goes beyond what an email or text message can do."" The box will replace the handmade and painted one currently used at the station. The BAS said ""the Royal Household worked with Royal Mail to arrange this particularly special delivery"". It was delivered to Rothera by the UK's polar research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough, along with the first major drop of supplies to the station following the long Antarctic winter. The post box will be installed in the Discovery Building, a new scientific support and operations hub. Postal logistics in such a remote area are understandably not straightforward. Ms Shaw's job is to oversee the formal Post Office logistics of getting mail in and out of Antarctica from Rothera, as well as getting post out to staff to other BAS stations and science field camps. Post has to be gathered and put on board the RRS Sir David Attenborough or on BAS aircraft to the Falkland Islands, where BAS maintains an office in Stanley. The final leg involves transport to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where letters enter the Royal Mail postal network for onward delivery. Jane Rumble, HM Commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory said: ""Maintaining a postal service in the British Antarctic Territory is far more than a symbolic gesture. ""It reinforces Britain's presence and heritage in Antarctica and provides a vital link to the wider world.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrnnze3mepo
2025-12-16,Why so many 'hazardous' plastic beads in River Irwell?,science,BBC,"A pollution investigation has been launched by the Environment Agency after a ""huge quantity"" of small plastic pellets have been found beside a river in Greater Manchester. The black pellets known as bio-beads, which can be toxic if swallowed by animals, were found strewn on the banks of the River Irwell in Bury. But what are they? And where have they come from? Bio-beads are plastic pellets used in some sewage treatment works as they provide a large surface area for bacteria to break down organic material into a treated liquid called sewage effluent. United Utilities use bio-beads at its wastewater treatment plant in Bury to break down sewage before clean water is discharged back into the River Irwell. Bio-beads are a hazard to wildlife because they can be mistaken for food, according to the RSPB, which said ""any pollution incident of this kind is deeply concerning"". A spokeswoman for the conservation charity said the beads can ""cause blockages that lead to malnutrition where birds feel full because they cannot digest the material"". Jamie Woodward, professor of Physical Geography at the University of Manchester said the pellets can get ""trapped in the gut"", and can be toxic to wildlife if they contain heavy metals and arsenic. He said: ""We don't know what the concentrations are in this Greater Manchester example, but it would be interesting to know what the composition of these beads is and what sort of contaminants they're carrying."" Caroline Brice spotted the beads in the river around the Springwater Park nature reserve in Whitefield earlier this year. She volunteers for the Love Springwater Park group and said in the summer she could see ""tonnes"" of the pellets, adding ""you could just scoop them out of the river"". A spokesperson for United Utilities said the firm believes that the ""small number"" of beads found at Springwater Park in June ""may have originated as a result of a minor issue with the treatment process at our works in Bury"". Ms Brice, 70, said the beads were damaging and their release was ""not showing any respect for the work we do to care for Springwater Park"". Chris Malkin, also 70, is another volunteer for the group which helps maintain the reserve. He said: ""Back in the summer, a lady alerted us that her dog was coming out of the River Irwell covered in black beads. ""We went down and saw that the riverbed was covered in black beads and there must have been millions of them."" Most of the pellets have now disappeared from Springwater Park but found thousands of them beside the water at Salford Quays. Mike Duddy, from the Salford Friendly Anglers Society, said: ""Hundreds of thousands of these little black beads were littering the River Irwell before floating into the Manchester Ship Canal and then out towards the Irish Sea."" The 59-year-old added: ""These beads look exactly like water snails, which is the staple diet of most fish, and incidents like this are making it more difficult for wildlife to thrive in our rivers"". The Environment Agency said it was investigating the incident. A spokesman said: ""We expect any responsible company to promptly report pollution to us directly, but none reported this spill of plastic beads. ""We are actively investigating this incident and have inspected multiple locations in the Irwell catchment to gather evidence."" The regulator also urged people to contact them if other rivers have been contaminated. Meanwhile, United Utilities said it is taking action to alleviate the issue. A spokesman for the firm said: ""We have a programme of works to mitigate against the risk of loss of bio-beads at this site. ""Subsequent reports of bio-beads being found in the River Irwell are now being investigated, to see if they originated from our works, or an alternative source.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp895kxerwdo

Dave McDonald set up the Crewe Clean Team in Crewe, Cheshire, in 2011 after spending much of his time clearing litter from an alleyway behind his house. Since he first sent out an email to about 15 people asking if they would be interested in joining, the group has grown to 284 members who have carried out 138 litter picks across the town to date. But for Mr McDonald, the issue of rubbish being carelessly discarded has only got worse since the clean team was born. He put this down to a lack of education and a lack of enforcement, but he also said there had been a ""cultural change"". ""More people eat 'on the hoof' and the number of takeaway food outlets has grown to meet that demand,"" he said. ""Some of these people, like some dog owners, are irresponsible."" He said Cheshire East Council and the government needed to do more to tackle the issue. ""It's very frustrating but what I can say is that we [Crewe Clean Team] are doing something about it and that is positive,"" Mr McDonald added. ""We can make a difference but it's frustrating that so many people don't seem to have any pride in their town. It's something that many of us who do this work in the clean team don't understand."" The team holds a litter pick every month, with about 15 to 25 volunteers tackling different parts of Crewe each time. Mr McDonald said they collect at least 30 bags of waste at every litter pick. The most ever collected was about 55 bags, he added. The group carries out a number of other projects, including planting flowers at various sites across the town, including at the Christ Church ruins. They have also recycled 4.75 tonnes of aluminium cans, written a ""greener developments guide"" for councillors considering planning applications and recently started a project to install swift nest boxes. While the group often faced challenges in raising enough money to function, Mr McDonald said the work was vital to the town's people and its wildlife, as well as to the volunteers' social lives. ""People often tell us that we are doing the council's job,"" he said. ""It is a way for them to justify to themselves why they are not helping to keep their own town clean. ""Of course, the council and the government should be doing more and we remind them of that regularly. ""However, we all know that this country would not function without the armies of volunteers who fill the gap between society's needs and state provision.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r33v7y157o
2025-12-17,'We're sorting veg 24/7 for your Christmas dinner',science,BBC,"A family-run carrot farm is working around the clock, harvesting 150 tonnes of carrots, seven days a week, to ensure the much-loved vegetable reaches dinner tables in time for Christmas Day. Poskitts, in Kellington, North Yorkshire, is aiming to supply one million bags of carrots for supermarkets across the country this Christmas. Director Ben Poskitt, 24, said: ""Any farmer who tells you they grow perfect veg is a liar. We pride ourselves by having as little food waste as possible."" Although most of the Christmas batch is deemed perfect, farmers often face crops growing larger, smaller and a bit wonkier than expected - with this year's drought not helping. Seeds for the Christmas crop were planted in April, and from then until December farmers have been under pressure to grow the best carrots in time for the big day. ""It's very, very challenging to get the crop ready for the right time and get it to the right size,"" said Mr Poskitt. This year's extreme weather added further stress. Mr Poskitt added: ""We've had a serious drought this year, so they've had six or seven passes of irrigation over the top of them, so they've been quite a costly crop to grow. ""Both us and the carrots were under a lot of stress in the summer."" In the run up to Christmas, Mr Poskitt explained carrot sales increase fourfold, while  the sale of parsnips also grown and processed by the company, which has farms across Yorkshire, increase tenfold. Only carrots of the perfect size, weight and shape end up in bags in the supermarket, but the wonky ones do not go to waste. Mr Poskitt said: ""We've got nearly 100 customers, ranging from retail to the dog food factory."" Some of the larger carrots are chopped into batons and also sold in supermarkets. In the on-site factory, a computer is used to grade about 46ft (14m) of carrots per second. Mr Poskitt said: ""The cameras make decisions based on quality, size and any defects on the carrots. This grades them for us so we can put them into boxes and bag them accordingly."" After being cleaned, packed and loaded on to lorries, the carrots will make their way from the Yorkshire fields to the supermarkets and ultimately to a festive dinner plate.

The Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) Caerlaverock site on the Solway Firth said it was not in a position to ""offer visitors the experience that they expect"". The centre introduced a reduced visitor experience in early November, to make physical changes to the site, as well as begin staff restructuring. It said it had tried its best to remain open to offer the ""very best experience"" but had been unable to fulfil that and had now taken the decision to close on 21 December. The WWT said the temporary closure would allow for recruitment of a new team, improvements to the reserve and general maintenance works. The winter months are historically a busy time of the year for bird watchers to the site, who visit the centre to witness the migration of flocks of barnacle geese. Thousands of the birds migrate from Svalbard, in the Arctic Circle, to overwinter at the reserve. They join many other birds including whooper and mute swans. The WWT said: ''We understand – and share – the disappointment that this will cause to everyone who spends time with us at WWT Caerlaverock. ''And we are particularly sorry to be closing at a time when we know you love to come and experience the wildlife spectacles that winter brings with it.''

Free-roaming ponies and donkeys in the New Forest, Hampshire, were seen scattering waste following the roll out of wheelie bins and caddies earlier this year, prompting a warning about the spread of serious animal diseases. The Commoners Defence Association (CDA) which represents livestock owners, had said there was a ""real risk"" of diseases such as African swine fever and foot and mouth spreading from contaminated food waste. New Forest District Council said temporary arrangements allowing certain properties to leave food waste caddies behind gates would now continue. Wheelie bins and food waste caddies are being phased in by the council as part of its plan to end the use of plastic sacks to collect waste and recyclables and increase recycling rates. In June, the council said it was aware of Residents in the village of Brockenhurst also posted images of donkeys knocking over bins on collection days.

As a result, affected properties were told to keep their outdoor food waste recycling caddy At a council meeting on Monday, the council said they should continue to do so after pannage ends on 4 January, with extra crews and vehicles allocated to allow for the time required to collect food waste caddies from behind gates. Geoffrey Blunden, portfolio holder for environment said: ""Continuing to collect food waste caddies from behind identified property gates in areas where livestock roam is an important part of making the new service work for all our communities. ""I'd like to thank our partners for helping shape this approach, and we'll keep working together to review wider collection methods where needed.""

2025-12-17,How many homes could be heated by cow poo?,science,BBC,"How many homes could be heated by cow muck? It is not a question I have thought about before, but as Britain searches for sustainable sources of heat, many farmers are looking, well, right under their noses. Cow manure can be treated to release biomethane, a renewable gas which is already used to power central heating boilers in about a million homes. But there is ""huge potential"" to increase that to 15 million homes, according to the campaign group Green Gas Taskforce. One dairy farmer who turns his cattle waste into biomethane, describes cow muck as ""nature's crude oil"". So how do you turn cow poo into gas? Could we really make that much of it? And is it as green as they claim? Clothier loves cow manure. In a cattle shed on the Somerset hills, near Bruton, we are scraping it off the floors with old fashioned shovels. The job is usually done by a robot these days, but the farmer is happy to do what many would call a dirty job. ""This is nature's crude oil for us,"" he says. ""This is highly calorific waste for generating gas."" Mr Clothier's family have been farming cattle for two centuries, and have always realised the power in manure. In 2013 they built a £4m plant to extract the methane from their cows' waste. The manure is collected in huge tanks and pumped into an anaerobic digester (AD), where bacteria break down the organic material. Mr Clothier explains: ""The methanogenic bacteria are gobbling up all the solids and generating loads of lovely methane, which we then catch in the hoods over the top."" The gas is then cleaned and carefully regulated before being injected into the national gas grid. Some is used directly to run the cheesemaking dairy for Wyke Farms, Mr Clothier's family business. ""We make 100% of our own energy"", he says. ""Which is great for the planet, and for our business."" So how many homes can be heated with the gas from Wyke's cows? In total, Mr Clothier calculates, 10,000 homes a year. Hardly any. British cows produce about 90 million tonnes of slurry every year, but only 2.5% of it is fed into AD plants. Despite the obvious benefits of free energy and even selling surplus power to the grid, the installation costs are high. So now a campaign is under way to get more gas produced this way. In the little village of Nether Stowey, nestled in the Quantock hills, a birthday party was under way in the village hall. It is an unusual cake, for a quirky celebration. The village's gas plant has turned 10, so locals made a cake shaped like the two domed gas tanks. The primary school children who came to the party have been raised almost entirely on gas from the nearby plant. This one is not fed with cattle manure, but human food waste. This is collected by local councils and fed into a digester, and once again the bacteria get to work. The cake is part of a campaign. Wales and West Utilities run the national gas grid in Somerset, and the company is keen to get more biomethane produced. Already the West Country is a ""hotbed for anaerobic digestion and biogas"", according to Matt Hindle, head of Net Zero at Wales and West. There are 20 biomethane plants in the south-west of England, but the firm wants more. ""We think biomethane could be a really significant part of our gas mix and could work with hydrogen, and electrification, as part of a whole system approach to decarbonisation of the heating system,"" said Mr Hindle. Ten times as much, or even more, according to the campaign. Clearly not all cow muck can be harvested. But if more food waste was collected, and more biogas plants built near dairy farms, ""by 2050, we could be looking at 10-15 million households heated with biomethane"", said Charles McAllister, director of the Green Gas Taskforce. The taskforce argues building more biogas plants near farms will spread the economic benefits of renewable energy to rural areas. Mr McAllister said: ""It means investment in rural communities, jobs in rural communities, not in the big cities, while decarbonising the energy we use and improving the local environment."" But even if the industry grows tenfold, it will reach a natural limit. There is, ultimately, only so much cow muck to feed the system. And that is where green campaigners worry that biogas will not be as green as it claims. Making gas out of cow muck is widely agreed to be a win for the planet. Capturing the methane in manure and putting it to controlled use is better than allowing it to evaporate, worsening climate change. But biogas is also made from other sources already, like crops grown for fuel not food. And environmentalists worry the rest of the gas in the pipelines will continue to come from fossil fuels, instead of being replaced by renewable electric power. Energy analysts at think tank Regen estimate that at best biomethane could replace 18% of total UK gas consumption. Tamsyn Lonsdale-Smith, the analyst who , said the potential of biomethane can be overstated. She said: ""Even 18% is an optimistic scenario, so we do need to find other ways to decarbonise heating and transport."" Back in his cattle sheds, Mr Clothier is sure of one thing. For dairy farmers like him, harnessing the natural power of his cow's daily waste is a no-brainer. He said: ""There's so much farm waste that could go into plants like this and generate loads of methane and save energy that otherwise the UK has to buy into the country.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7ve41je3lo

The explorer, who is from Blackpool and known for appearing in Channel 4's Hunted programme, trained for nearly a year and spent more than three weeks travelling across the Antarctic wilderness to reach the southernmost point on Earth. ""If standing at the bottom of the world encourages even one young person to dream bigger, push further or believe in themselves when others say they cannot, then every frozen mile has been worth it,"" he said.

The lunar impact flash - an explosion of light caused by something hitting the Moon's surface - was spotted by Andrew Marshall-Lee, a final-year PhD student. AOP said lunar impact flashes are rare events, seen only very occasionally, with this believed to be the second recording in the UK. Mr Marshall-Lee used the Armagh Robotic Telescope (ART) to capture the footage on Friday in a moment he said will stick with him ""for a lifetime"". ""Normally what you would do is take hours of footage, run it through some software you write and then it'll ping out if anything has popped up,"" Mr Marshall-Lee said. ""I was very fortunate in that I just so happened to be looking at the screen at the right time and I saw it happen with my own eyes. ""That's the luck of it - I couldn't quantify it. ""It was very special to me and it will be a moment that sticks with me for a lifetime."" The observatory said lunar impact flashes usually only last fractions of a second and are difficult to detect. It said they are more likely to be detected during major meteor showers when the Moon passes through streams of debris left behind by comets and asteroids. The objects responsible for the flashes are typically very small, often smaller than a golf ball, and are far too faint to be seen with a telescope while in space, it added. When they strike the Moon at extremely high speeds their kinetic energy is rapidly converted into heat and light which briefly vaporises material at the impact site and produces the flash seen from Earth. AOP estimates this particular object was travelling at about 35 km/s. Mr Marshall-Lee observed its impact during the peak of the , making it the most likely origin of the object which caused the flash. AOP said it will continue to investigate the object's origin and a video of the flash it created can be seen",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgex0d02ejxo

Forestry England said satellite trackers from two eagles were found in September, apparently cut off and dumped close to the birds' last recorded location. The missing birds are part of a project led by Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation to reintroduce the birds which had been extinct in England for more than two centuries. The charity said the finds were ""devastating"". Thirty-seven birds were initially released on the Isle of Wight in 2019. Several breeding pairs have since formed with six chicks being born in the wild for the first time since the 1780s. Forestry England said a satellite tag belonging to a chick - G842 - was recovered from the River Rother, near Petersfield on the Hampshire-Sussex border on 26 September. It had been removed from the bird using a sharp instrument. Searches in the area to try and locate the body of the bird were unsuccessful. Sussex Police has appealed for information from anyone who was in or around Harting Down and Petersfield on the evening of 20 September and may have seen the bird or any suspicious behaviour. Tim Mackrill from the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation said: ""So many people in the area had shared the joy of seeing these birds breed again after hundreds of years and our ongoing monitoring has shown how well they were fitting into the landscape. ""To have that destroyed just a few months later is deeply shocking."" Dyfed Powys Police is investigating a similar incident on 13 September, where a satellite tag belonging to white-tailed eagle G615 was recovered in remote moorland near the Gwgia Reservoir, Tregynon. Police Scotland is treating the as suspicious. The tag for G819 stopped transmitting data daily on 8 November in the Moorfoot Hills area.

Bex Brown, the park's head of carnivores, said she is pleased how the polar bear is settling into his new surroundings. "" It will be quite a change for Brodie, who has been on his own for a while and before that was just with his mother,"" she said. ""He will have to learn a whole new set of polar bear social skills as he gets to know the older adult bears here."" The polar bear area at the park spans 10 acres and is ""designed to replicate the Arctic tundra found in North Canada during the summer"". It is already home to six polar bears: Nobby, Hamish, Luka, Sisu, Indiana and Yuma. Daren McGarry, head of living collections at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: ""While we will miss Brodie while he is on his holidays, it is great to be able to fully concentrate on the work needed in his habitat.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y27yvyg40o
2025-12-18,Sir David Attenborough's London - why he wouldn't live anywhere else,science,BBC,"Lying on his side on a dark summer night earlier this year, Sir David Attenborough is watching a hedgehog snuffling around an urban garden. ""I think they're lovely things,"" he says softly, with a chuckle. His voice blends boyish wonder with the wisdom of his 99 years - each in equal measure. Considered by many as the most famous broadcaster and conservationist of our time, Sir David has circled the globe for 70 years to show us the brilliance of the natural world. Now, in a new one-off documentary, he has come home - to London. Gaby Bastyra, executive producer at Passion Planet, which made the film, said Sir David ""could live anywhere in the world… but he's always come home to London"". The programme, she says, is an ""appreciation of his place - and he loves it"". So can the capital's wildlife compare to the broadcaster's encounters with Well, Wild London is abundant with animal curiosities: from pigeons hopping on to the Hammersmith and City line to a snake colony by a canal. Sir David also draws our awareness to the dramas happening every day among and above us in this city of about nine million people. In one scene, there are glimpses of a bullish, noisy beast through the summer leaves. This is not a preying tiger in the Indian jungle - but a happily mooching Dalmatian dog in Dagnam Park, Romford, unknowingly closing in on a days-old fallow deer fawn. David Mooney, chief executive of the London Wildlife Trust, which co-produced Wild London, said he was completely ""enthralled"" by that ""juxtaposition"". ""That's not to say that dogs are a problem. It's just wildlife is interacting with us at all times,"" he said. ""The raw experiences of nature are something that at London Wildlife Trust we've been talking about for a long time."" Perhaps the most poignant moments in Wild London, broadcast months before Sir David turns 100 years old, are where he shows particular tenderness towards the animals he meets. At the Houses of Parliament, he holds a peregrine falcon chick while it is ringed for identification. It tips its head back to look up at him as he says to it softly: ""Now we can recognise you anywhere - yes, yes you."" In Greenford, west London, Sir David gently cradles a tiny harvest mouse before releasing it into a meadow. He encourages it to scramble on to a wildflower, with an affectionate: ""Welcome to your new home - there you go."" It doesn't want to leave the safety of his cupped hands. Joe Loncraine, director of Wild London, has worked with Sir David on several other nature documentaries. He said: ""There were some moments I think that deliver the kind of interactions with him and an animal that I hadn't seen in a while. ""There was something about the warmth that came across. And I think his enthusiasm for what was happening was so infectious."" Sir David was greatly impressed by , which he says in the film, has had such a ""positive impact"" in west London. He observes: ""If someone had told me when I first moved here that one day I would be watching wild beavers in London, I would have thought they were mad. But there they are, right behind me."" He uses this as an example of us ""securing a brighter future for both animals, and us, too"" in our unique metropolis - the world's greenest major city. Mr Mooney said: ""His message is: people have to take note of it - if people notice it, they will begin to love it - if people love it, they'll want to protect it. And if people protect it, we'll be on a path to nature recovery."" Wild London, coming late in such a revered canon of nature documentaries, is Sir David's way of nudging us to marvel at the nature on our doorsteps, amidst the frenzy of daily life. Mr Loncraine sums up: ""We can be rushing about our jobs, commuting to work, picking the kids up from school, going to the shops - and not really notice. ""There can be really quite beautiful animals right there - so it's just about taking that moment to have a look.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93wj8134q0o
2025-12-18,"Farmers 'bewildered and frightened' over inheritance tax, report finds",science,BBC,"Farmers are ""bewildered and frightened"" with many questioning the future of their businesses because of the government's proposed changes to inheritance tax, an independent review of farm profitability has found. The long-awaited government-commissioned report was published on Thursday with 57 recommendations designed to improve productivity, investment and resilience in agriculture. But author Baroness Minette Batters, former president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), warned there was ""no silver bullet"" to making farms in England profitable. Environment secretary Emma Reynolds said the government and the farming and food industries would work much more closely together in the future. That would be done through a newly created farming and food partnership board made up of senior industry and government leaders that would ""drive growth, productivity and long-term profitability across the sector"", she explained. ""When farming thrives, the whole country benefits. British farmers are central to our food security, our rural economy and the stewardship of our countryside,""  the secretary of state added. ""This is about serious action to remove barriers, unlock investment and make the food system work better, so farm businesses can grow, invest and plan for the future with confidence."" Baroness Batters' review called for a ""new deal for profitable farming"" that would recognise the true cost of producing food and delivering for the environment. The report did not look in detail at the government's proposed changes to inheritance tax, which are set to apply to farm businesses worth more than £1 million at a rate of 20% from April 2026. But Baroness Batters said it was raised as the single biggest concern by almost everyone in the farming sector she talked to as part of the review. She said the sector had faced a sharp rise in costs and increasingly extreme weather, with severe drought this year. Uncertainty surrounding the closure of applications to the sustainable farming incentive scheme - the post-Brexit agricultural payments scheme - and proposed changes to inheritance tax had created ""significant"" ongoing concern, with some farmers ""questioning viability let alone profitability"". In the review, she said: ""The farming sector is bewildered and frightened of what might lie ahead."" The report added that costs would be 30% higher in 2026 than they were in 2020, while the £2.4bn farming budget for England had been almost the same since 2007 - even as farmers and growers are asked to do more to comply with environmental legislation, with less funding and no certainty. Baroness Batters added: ""Farmers don't want handouts from the state, they want nothing more than to run thriving, profitable farming businesses, by earning a fair return for what they produce."" The NFU said it was ""a thorough and complex report"" which was ""right to recognise reform is needed"". President Tom Bradshaw said that of the issues raised, fairness in the supply chain was a ""top priority"" alongside planning reforms and focus on growing exports. ""But alongside this, there are other immediate actions that are needed to boost British farming like providing much-needed clarity and certainty on the future of the sustainable farming incentive and doing the right thing on the pernicious inheritance tax changes,"" he added. Gavin Lane, president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents rural businesses and landowners, welcomed the review and said it was now time for ""urgent action"". ""As this report highlights, profitability across the sector is perilously slim, with farmers battling high input costs, low commodity prices and volatile weather conditions. ""Many farm businesses are marginal or loss-making, yet will soon be hit with unaffordable inheritance tax bills, which in many cases will dwarf their annual profit,"" he explained. In response to the review, the government said it was also taking action on planning reform to make food production a clearer priority, speed up on-farm reservoirs, polytunnels and farm shops, and make it easier for farmers to invest. The government is also stepping up action on supply chain fairness, tackling barriers to private finance and supporting exports and new markets, a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9975z55dr5o
2025-12-17,"Billionaire Jared Isaacman, an Elon Musk ally, confirmed as Nasa chief",science,BBC,"The US Senate has approved the appointment of billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to lead Nasa, capping an unusual nomination process where President Donald Trump put his name forward, withdrew it, and then renominated him for the post. Isaacman, 42, an amateur jet pilot who became the first non-professional astronaut to conduct a spacewalk, is the first Nasa administrator in decades to come directly from outside government. For many, his tenure atop the agency will be judged by one crucial test - whether it can return humans to the Moon ahead of China. Trump has made clear he wants the US to establish a permanent lunar base to enable resource extraction and to serve as a stepping stone to Mars. On Wednesday, senators voted by large margin, 67-30, to confirm Isaacman's appointment. Trump first announced his intent to nominate Isaacman in December 2024, but he withdrew the nomination in May in the middle of a public feud with Elon Musk, an ally of Isaacman. Musk, one of Trump's largest political donors and the chief executive of SpaceX, had been a regular presence in the Oval Office alongside Trump, but they had a bitter falling out over government spending. Within days, Trump withdrew Isaacman's nomination, citing a ""thorough review of prior associations"". In November, the president re-upped Isaacman's nomination. During a confirmation hearing earlier this month, Isaacman said he embraces Trump's mission to mine the moon. In the current space battle, countries are racing to exploit the lunar surface. “This is not the time for delay but a time for action because if we fall behind - if we make a mistake - we may never catch up, and the consequences could shift the balance of  power here on Earth,” Isaacman told senators. The billionaire entrepreneur sees bringing in more private sector competition as key to competing in the space race. His openness to commerical competition could create a conflict with Musk. Last week, Isaacman praised the award of a major contract to Blue Origin, owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos and a rival of SpaceX. He has also suggested Nasa should partner more with universities and academic institutions, positioning the agency as a ""force multiplier for science"". He indicated he would do whatever it takes to push innovation forward, particularly ""if we are on the verge of something extraordinary"". ""I will explore every option to get the program to the pad, even funding it myself if that's what it takes to deliver the science,"" he wrote at one point. According to Forbes, Isaacman's net worth is estimated at $1.2bn (£894m) made mostly from his payment-processing company and the sale of a firm that trained pilots and operated a private fleet of military aircraft. The Nasa administrator role will be his first job in politics. He will succeed Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, who has served as interim Nasa chief since July.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydvlx28kwo
2025-12-18,Water boss 'mistaken' to keep £1.3m payment secret,science,BBC,"Yorkshire Water boss Nicola Shaw said ""not being transparent"" about receiving payments worth £1.3m from the firm's parent company was a ""mistake"" but the amounts were ""not for me to decide"". Ms Shaw received two previously undisclosed payments of £660,000 from Kelda Holdings in 2023-24 and 2024-25, for her role as an executive director. The shareholder-funded payments came on top of her Yorkshire Water salary, which totalled £1.7m across the same period. Asked whether she would reconsider accepting substantial extra payments in future, she said: ""I get paid what the board decide I ought to be paid and I think that's right; it shouldn't be for me to decide what that is."" The payments came to light in August, two months after When asked by the BBC if she could understand why the extra payments from Kelda might be seen as ""a bit murky"", Ms Shaw replied: ""I can absolutely understand it feels like it's a lot of money [but] running big organisations, that's what people get paid and that's what the board has been thinking about and what they think is important. ""I do understand that we need to be transparent because we're providing the water and taking away the wastewater for people in Yorkshire and they need to trust us."" She said Kelda had not wanted Yorkshire Water's customers to foot the bill to give her ""Kelda level"" pay so it approved shareholder-funded payments instead. She added that extra payments from Kelda would be reported in Yorkshire Water's accounts in future. In September, the government asked water regulator Ofwat to carry out an urgent review into the two payments. Environment Secretary Steve Reed told the House of Commons he ordered the inquiry to find out the facts, saying customers were ""outraged"". ""I will not tolerate any company attempting to circumvent this government's ban on unfair bonuses,"" he said. In November, Ofwat stated the payments were outside of its bonus ban as they were classed as parent group payments rather than direct annual performance bonuses. However, it said it was considering plans to force water firms to report pay received from parent companies. Ms Shaw had declined a bonus in 2023, before the legislation was introduced, saying it would ""not be appropriate"" to accept it given Yorkshire Water's pollution record. The firm had discharged untreated wastewater into rivers for an average of seven hours a day in 2023, with nearly half its storm overflows breaching regulations, according to an Ofwat investigation. The company was later ordered to pay £40m to address the ""serious failures"". But in December 2024, as plans were announced to increase water bills by 41%, Ms Shaw accepted a bonus of £371,000 from the company. She said the money came from shareholders rather than customers, and the price hike would pay for supply upgrades, reducing sewage discharges and storm overflows. From January to early September this year, reservoir levels in Yorkshire dropped by nearly two thirds, leading to a second hosepipe ban in three years. The situation raised questions about water storage, given three of the wettest autumns on record in South Yorkshire have been since 2020. Ms Shaw said: ""Do we need to have a look again to see whether we might need a reservoir? I think yes, so we're about to start that process. ""We need to look at all of our forecasts again because, as you say, things are changing, and it's not just they're changing; it's they're less predictable."" However, she said a new reservoir would not ""sort short-term problems"", adding that they take enormous"" planning and can be ""very costly"", noting Anglian Water's two new reservoirs would cost more than £4bn. The last reservoir built in Yorkshire was Grimwith in 1983. Since then, the population relying on Yorkshire Water's supply has risen by about 750,000. Ms Shaw said water was easier to transport now which, combined with other water sources like boreholes, ""makes a huge difference to our resilience"". More boreholes were in the process of being built, she said, and the company was considering alternative storage options like old coal mines. ""We are working really closely with the local authorities in all areas, to try and make sure we have the water and the wastewater services that people need,"" she said. Earlier this year, Yorkshire Water said the fees paid to her by Kelda reflected the ""critical importance of the work during this period that was led by Nicola in securing long-term investment"". It said her work for the parent company included ""investor engagement, financial oversight, and management"". Cat Hobbs, director of public ownership campaign group We Own It, described Ms Shaw's pay as an ""absurd level of salary"" and called the Kelda Holdings payments as ""disgraceful"". ""It is time for water companies to work for households and the environment instead of a handful of shareholders and overpaid bosses,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9kv0jlyn0o
2025-12-18,Disabled adventurer 'gutted' to ditch South Pole bid,science,BBC,"A disabled adventurer from Shropshire has said he is ""gutted"" to have made the decision to abandon his world record attempt in the Antarctic. Darren Edwards, from Shrewsbury, who is paralysed from the chest down, hoped to reach the South Pole and break a record for the longest-ever sit-ski expedition by a disabled person. In a video posted to his Facebook page in the early hours of Thursday morning, he told his followers: ""I am so sorry to have let you down. ""We're not going to reach the South Pole, the distances we're doing each day, the amount of hours we're out each day, the terrain that we're challenging and trying to get through each day is so incredibly tough."" He described it as the ""toughest physical and mental thing I've ever done"". ""The snow is like sandpaper, so every push of my poles get me maybe six inches further forward, and we are down to temperatures of minus 40,"" he added. The challenge would have seen him cover cover 137 miles (222km) over a period of 20 days. The current record for the longest sit-ski to the South Pole stands at almost 69 miles (111km). He was raising funds for charity Wings for Life, which is researching cures for spinal cord injuries. ""The reality is that we're not reaching the Pole in time, we don't have the rations, we can't afford the resupply,"" he said. ""We could continue, we could plan ahead as a four, carrying injuries, we could go until we ran out of food - but I don't see the success in that, I actually think the success was starting in the first place. ""The reality is, we're not covering enough distance each day, we're far to slow to reach the Pole in time, and that hurts, really hurts and I feel like I've let a lot of people down."" Former mountaineer and army reservist Mr Edwards was paralysed in 2016 at the age of 26 after a rock climbing accident. Since then, he has been part of the first disabled team to cross Europe's largest ice cap, Vatnajokull in Iceland, and undertaken seven marathons in seven days on seven continents.

2025-12-18,"Archaeologists uncover 3,000-year-old mysterious mass burial site",science,BBC,"Newly published research has revealed a ""mysterious mass burial event"" in the south of Scotland about 3,300 years ago. Excavations were undertaken in 2020 and 2021 by Guard Archaeology during the construction of the access route to the Twentyshilling Wind Farm near Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway. It revealed a Bronze Age barrow - an ancient burial mound - with the cremated bones of several people contained inside five closely-packed urns. Archaeologist Thomas Muir, who led the excavation, said it appeared that some kind of ""horrible event"" such as famine had led to so many burials at the same time. The wind farm sits about three miles (4.8km) south of Sanquhar on open rough upland terrain. During their work, Guard Archaeology found the urns with the cremated bones of at least eight individuals all placed there in one mass burial event some time between 1439 and 1287 BC. A small group of pits some distance north was also excavated, revealing late Neolithic activity between 2867 and 2504 BC. ""The five urns in the Twentyshilling Barrow contained at least eight individuals,"" said Mr Muir. ""The urns were deposited at the same time as they were packed tightly within the pit and adhered to the same 15th to 13th Century BC date range."" He said that indicated that it was a single mass burial, ""possibly of the same family or group"". ""What is significant about the Twentyshilling remains is that they were cremated and then buried almost immediately,"" he said. He said that was unusual as there was ""quite a tradition"" in the Bronze Age of leaving bodies out for some time, as seen on another dig at Broughton in the Borders. ""That had been reopened a few times and reused so it has been used by a community over a long period of time,"" he said. ""Whereas what we have at Twentyshilling is some sort of horrible event must have happened to the community - possibly famine - and a lot of people have died within a very short period of each other."" The Bronze Age in the area may have been a ""time of particular stress"" as other burial sites in the region show evidence of famine and abandonment. The archaeological work at Twentyshilling was a required condition of planning permission for the wind farm which is now fully operational.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedxev6e027o

The Pollinator Project in Guernsey was chosen for the funding from Dougie's Grant, which was set up in 2022 in memory of Douglas Le Huquet, a ""proud Guernsey man"" who lived in the island for almost 100 years. Mr Le Huquet's daughter Michelle Knowles said ""such was his love of Guernsey he wanted to leave a legacy behind for the good of the Guernsey community"". Chairman of the Pollinator Project, Gordon Steele, said the award was a ""fantastic surprise"". The Pollinator Project was founded in 2017 to make a positive difference to nature in Guernsey. As the name suggests, it focuses on pollinators that visit flowering plants. Mr Steele said: ""Sometimes you apply for grants and you just have to forget about them, the competition is really fierce to get funding for charities - there are so many good causes across the Bailiwick. ""We realised we had a chance with our Fort Field restoration plans. We know that Dougie enjoyed nature and that walking through meadows filled with flowers was something he loved."" The charity said the money would be used to pay for a range of tree planting, improvement work on the wildflower meadows, public amenities, and to pay for the annual cutting, baling and making of hay. Ms Knowles said her father would have been ""delighted with the plans for Fort Field"". ""The money is going to pay for an avenue of wild cherry trees, fruit trees and a picnic bench, and work on the wildflower meadow,"" she said.

2025-12-21,What is a poinsettia and how do you stop it dying?,science,BBC,"For many people across the UK, it's not a proper Christmas without a poinsettia to brighten up the house. Originating in South America and parts of Africa, the plants are a fixture on supermarket shelves and garden centres across the country. But for some, the distinctive red plants seem hard to keep healthy once they are taken home. So what is the best way to look after the plants? Are they poisonous? And will they last until next year? Duncan Taylor ran Arden Lea Nurseries in West Lancashire for decades before he handed over the business to his sons. It takes the nurseries six months to grow about 25,000 poinsettias every year, to be sold at Christmas across the region. ""You've got to treat them like your wife, very gently and catering to their every need,"" Mr Taylor said. The plants like slightly warmer temperatures of around 15°C (60°F), ""which is no trouble in June, but it is a problem around September, October, November"", Mr Taylor said. ""Don't put it over where the radiator is and don't put it in bright sunshine, but it likes light."" The RHS advises only watering the plant when the surface of the compost has begun to feel dry. The BBC Gardeners World Magazine suggests increasing humidity by spraying gently with water every few days. Poinsettias produce a milky coloured sap that is an irritant to humans and pets. The Royal Horticultural Society advises that it is best to avoid touching this, as it could cause skin and eye irritation. The Poison Control Centre in the United States of America advises that if children or pets do eat it they can develop a mouth rash or an upset stomach. Unlike popular myths, the sap is not deadly to pets or humans. Poinsettias come from South America and Africa, and are thought to have become popular Christmas houseplants thanks to a Mexican legend. The story goes that a young girl wanted to leave a gift for the baby Jesus at a Christmas Eve service at church. But she could not afford to buy a gift, so left a bundle of weeds instead. The weeds flowered into the famous red leaves of a poinsettia plant, becoming synonymous with the colourful festive season. Once your plant seems content, Mr Taylor advises to keep it where it is, and it should last at least a few months. You would have to get a little bit lucky for your poinsettia to last a full 12 months, he said, and even then, it might not look quite as vibrant the next year. ""I think the most I've ever kept one was to about May,"" he said. ""And it wasn't dead then, it was just very dusty and I got fed up with it. ""Keep it as long as you can, and when you are sick of it chuck it away and buy a new one."" BBC Gardeners World magazine advises its readers to feed poinsettias monthly after Christmas with a high potash liquid feed, such as a tomato feed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dz8krpln4o

But council leader Jeremy Hilton has said that they had ""no plans"" to downgrade recycling and ""will not be getting rid of the fortnightly collection"".

Opponents cited fears about the potential impact on the landscape, which includes a Grade II-listed farmhouse, but the inspectorate said the adverse effects would be ""decisively"" outweighed by the benefits of the scheme.

2025-12-20,Donations for new wildlife hospital reach £1.8m,science,BBC,"An animal charity has raised almost half of its £3.7m target for a new wildlife hospital. GSCPA said the walls of the new hospital were being constructed as part of the Biggest Build Appeal, which has now raised more than £1.8m. It said there was still lots of work to do, including installing solar panels, which are estimated to cost £65,000 per building and upgrading the IT system, which would cost £12,000. The charity said it was looking for people to support the campaign by making a donation, buying a brick or sponsoring a room. Steve Byrne, GSPCA manager, said: ""Seeing the walls of the wildlife hospital rise is incredibly exciting, but we still need your help to finish the job. ""From bricks to solar panels, every donation counts."" The charity has launched a new leaflet to inform people about the buy a brick offer and other ways to donate to the Biggest Build Appeal.

2025-12-21,'My artichoke is officially the world's biggest',science,BBC,"An amateur gardener said it was ""surreal"" to have an official world record artichoke thistle on his front lawn. In July, Guinness World Records judges fast-tracked the process to assess the 3.22m-tall (10.6ft) , because of fears it would wilt. and opened up his certificate last weekend. ""Once we knew for sure [it was a record], it was a really, really good feeling,"" said the 49-year-old, from Rayleigh, Essex. Mr Garnett named the plant Audrey, inspired by the Little Shop of Horrors musical, but has now trimmed it back. Audrey will grow back with gusto in 2026 - he hopes - and he is selling her seeds to anyone tempted to compete against him. In exchange for the seeds, he is collecting donations for Havens Hospices, which is based in Southend-on-Sea. ""I'm hoping that this one may be taller again next year so we've got a race on our hands,"" he told BBC Essex. ""I've got quite a few [artichokes], some have self-seeded in the garden at the back, so I've got some baby Audreys out there, so bring it on!"" Mr Garnett revealed that he grew Audrey just with a ""bit of horse manure"". He said the postman was a great admirer, but that one councillor called it a ""monstrosity"". Guinness World Records confirmed it was the first time it had verified a plant of this particular species, describing it as a ""genuine first of its kind"". Mr Garnett said the plant was an ""annoyance"" for his family initially, because it was blocking out light into the living room. ""But as the story took off, and as she got to the peak and we realised it could be a world record, then they've been fully behind it; so much so that my wife's even made a blue plaque for me,"" he said. ""My dad was a fruit farmer so maybe it's a family thing,"" he added. Horticulturalist Simon Corlick said he identified the plant as a cynara cardunculus, also known as a cardoon or artichoke thistle, via its ""sea mine-looking flower head"".

2025-12-21,Plans for region's largest nature reserve revealed,science,BBC,"An abandoned former golf course which costs around £70,000 a year to maintain could become home to the largest nature reserve in the West Midlands. Brandon Wood Golf Course closed to the public in 2020 and Coventry City Council is now discussing plans to turn it into a 64-hectare nature reserve, 6km away from Coventry city centre. The reserve would link with surrounding land to create over 350 hectares of land dedicated to preserving wildlife, with the potential to support ospreys, otters and beavers. Plans will be discussed at  cabinet on 6 January and will go to full council the following week. If councillors agree, the scheme could begin in 2026. Approval of the plans would see the golf course's fairways, greens and bunkers replaced with wetland, grassland, ponds, hedgerows and shrubs, which would be created and maintained by experts from the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. This would include introducing a herd of cattle on the site for natural grazing. A number of options had previously been considered, including a hotel, glamping site, solar farm, and gravel extraction. However, none were considered financially or environmentally suitable, and the area is also prone to flooding. Councillor Jim O'Boyle said: ""This is a unique opportunity to create something very special, not just for the city and the region, but for the country's wildlife. ""We know the UK is one of the most nature depleted nations in the world, with one in six species at risk of extinction, and everyone has to take action. ""We made a commitment in the council's Climate Change Strategy to do all we can to support nature recovery - and this site presents a significant opportunity to do that at a scale rarely seen."" The council would need to obtain planning permission for the change of use from Rugby Borough Council and would then work with Warwickshire County Council and other partners to develop the site. That includes Warwickshire Wildlife Trust, which manages land around the golf course and has its headquarters at the neighbouring Brandon Marsh Nature Reserve. Mr O'Byle said there was also the possibility of building an outdoor education centre on the site of the old clubhouse. Councillors are to discuss a plan for a phased development, with the financial cost supported through income generated from property developers who are required to improve natural habitats as party of any project. Ed Green, CEO of Warwickshire Wildlife Trust, said, ""Bringing the former golf course into management for wildlife joins up several sites across the wider Brandon area and creates the scale needed to support several key species. ""People in the future can expect to see ospreys, bitterns and perhaps even beavers one day, just a few minutes from Coventry city centre."" If the council fails to take action, the land would continue to cost around £70,000 a year to maintain, along with a continued risk of the site being used for fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvg25pzll3o
2025-12-23,Council confirms bird flu case in popular city park,science,BBC,"A case of bird flu has been found in a popular city park, a council has confirmed. St Albans City and District Council has put up signs in Verulamium Park stating avian flu was identified by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) after ""some waterfowl had recently become unwell and died"". The notices urge the public not to ""touch any birds or go into the water"" and also advise dog owners to keep their pets out of the lake. A spokesperson for wildlife charity Swan Rescue Hertfordshire (SRH) said around ten geese in the area are now thought to have died from the disease. Abi Edis, from SRH, which works under the umbrella of national charity The Swan Sanctuary, said she was called on 4 December by a local resident who had seen two dead Canadian geese in the water. ""I reported it to Defra and the results have now come back that it was positive, so one or both of the geese had avian flu,"" she said. The park ranger also confirmed to the BBC that Defra had taken deceased birds away from the park and had subsequently confirmed avian flu was present. One hundred-acre Verulamium Park, popular with dog walkers, is close to St Albans city centre. It is named after the Roman city on which it stands. The walls and other remnants of  Verulamium can be seen there. Ms Edis added: ""If you're walking a dog, keep it on a lead, because the birds will be weaker if they are suffering from the virus, so they're more likely to be attacked. ""Bird flu is transferred by bodily fluids, so poo and saliva, so don't contaminate yourself,"" she added. ""Make sure you're washing your hands. ""If you do visit water in different areas, make sure you clean your shoes between different sites because obviously if we've got avian flu in Verulamium Park you don't want to track that to another site somewhere else."" Defra said the public should report findings of dead wild birds online or by calling 03459 33 55 77. ""Do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find unless strictly necessary,"" it added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w70151rppo

The mass of congealed fat, oil and grease has been found under Whitechapel and measures around 100m long. Thames Water said the extraction of the blockage could take ""weeks to complete"" and ""it serves as a stark reminder that what goes down the drain doesn't disappear"". The company is urging people to think carefully about what they pour down sinks and flush away over the festive period. Thames Water says residents are not currently affected as the sewer remains only partially blocked. Tim Davies, head of waste operations for north London, said: ""This latest fatberg shows exactly what happens when fats, oils and wipes go down our drains – they don't disappear, they build up and cause serious damage. ""The cost of clearing blockages and repairing sewers runs into tens of millions of pounds every year, and that money ultimately comes from our customers."" The blockage has been dubbed ""the grandchild"" of the 2017 Whitechapel fatberg, which weighed 130 tonnes and stretched more than 250m. That fatberg was one of the largest ever found in the city, and a sample even went on display at the Museum of London.

The new 240-litre burgundy bins are part of efforts to introduce ""a one-bin-for-all-recycling"" system. Currently, residents in the district have to put glass and tins into a separate container, but with the new system, due to be introduced in April, all plastic, metal, glass, card and paper will be able to go in one bin. Rob Waltham, leader of North Lincolnshire Council, said: ""This is about making everyday services simpler while helping people recycle more with less hassle."" Waltham described the move as ""another big step forward"", adding: ""We're improving recycling, keeping garden waste collections free, and making sure the new service works for every household."" The authority said the new bins had been fully funded by the Department for Environment, at no extra cost to local taxpayers. Residents who preferred to keep their current recycling container could also opt out through a simple online form. A free weekly garden and food waste collection in one bin will also be introduced, with a fortnightly general waste collection for anything that cannot be recycled continuing as before. Neil Poole, the council's deputy leader, said: ""We're getting ahead and getting ready.

2025-12-22,Team spirit praised in community container clean-up,science,BBC,"Fragments of metal, pieces of insulation foam and plastic remain on West Sussex beaches after 11 shipping containers containing bananas and avocados washed ashore. Communities praised the ""team spirit"" of volunteers and contractors as the clean up continued at Bognor Regis, Selsey and Pagham Harbour, after West Sussex County Council said six containers have been removed, but Gavin Jones who lives on Selsey seafront said there were ""bits of metal poking up through the sand"". The Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the containers might not have been properly secured. Seven containers washed up in Selsey, two at Pagham Harbour and two at Bognor Regis. Selsey Beach Litter Ninjas are among those who have helped with the clean-up operation. ""Two weeks ago I looked out of my kitchen window and there was something floating in the sea... it turned out to be a container. ""A couple of hours later it was smashing itself against the sea wall at the end of the garden. It's gradually dissolved into really big pieces.""

""I don't know what they're going to do here... but [the volunteers and contractors] are doing a fantastic job,"" he said. The clean up operation had ""pulled the community together... it's been a fantastic team spirit,"" said Mr Jones. However, the ongoing clean-up has had a negative impact in terms of safety risks and pollution, he added, with the Selsey Sea Bathers swimming club cancelling their winter solstice sea dip on Sunday ""because of these bits of metal that are still poking up through the sand"".

2025-12-24,My friend Henry the Robin - how a tame bird went viral,science,BBC,"A man's remarkable friendship with a robin on the shores of Lough Neagh has proved a viral hit. Henry the Robin began visiting Tom McElhone just over a year ago in the workshop where he restores DeLorean cars. Videos of his visits posted on social media by Tom's son have attracted ""millions"" of views, making him possibly the most famous robin in the world. For Tom, ""it's amazing the amount of people who are reaching out with a very common thread of a connection with these little creatures"". With songbirds in decline across Europe, he said it is important to ""cherish"" moments like this. It all began as a way of keeping in touch with his family. His wife is American, and their children are around the world. When Henry began visiting the workshop, Tom recorded him and sent the video to his son, who ""put it on Instagram, a technology that I know nothing of"". ""Henry has now got two million views on Instagram, so he's world famous."" Tom runs his DeLorean workshop as an open house for his (human) friends. That means it can be noisy, crowded with people, and filled with smoke from machinery as he restores the classic gull-winged cars. He was surprised when Henry ""started hanging out, just following me around the workshop"". He began by offering the bird some food, and Henry repaid him by singing. ""It's amazing just how much time he spends in the workshop here at this time of year, just hanging out,"" said Tom. ""He'll sit over in the corner and practise his song while I'm messing around with something, or he gets on with his life and I get on with my life. ""Yeah, we co-habit quite well as friends."" Tom has suffered some ""quite serious illnesses"" over the years, leading to him giving up full-time employment. ""When I'm lying in a hospital bed with tubes coming out of everywhere, feeling sorry for myself, I move myself to moments like this, where this little guy is willing to spend the time with me and giving me a little solace when I'm not feeling so good."" He enjoys the different songs Henry quietly sings while he is in the workshop. ""He does it by throat-singing and he controls the volume of his song with opening and closing his beak. ""So when he's throat-singing, he's actually practising songs that he'll sing later on in the garden."" Henry's ""very gregarious"" nature enlivened the darker days of last winter in the workshop. But when Spring arrived this year, Henry left. Tom feared the worst for his newfound friendship. ""I would see him out in the trees and the bushes singing, but he would not come near me, not even for his favourite food, mealworms. ""So I thought he was gone - that was it - I thought our relationship was over."" Then the colder weather returned, and with it, Henry. ""About a month ago, lo and behold, Henry picks up exactly where he left off, as if nothing had happened, back on my knee singing and back in the workshop. Tom described Henry as ""a gift of nature"". Now, the little performer arrives most mornings, just after Tom opens the shed doors. Henry will flap his wings when he wants to be fed, a signal Tom has learned to recognise. His advice to anyone else hoping to attract a feathered friend? ""It's surprising what a little mealworm will do for a relationship."" Songbirds across the UK have declined by more than 40 million in the past five decades, according to the Tom said statistics like those make his friendship with Henry and their connection with people around the world all the more important. ""To connect with a single little bird like this, and to reach out where millions of people have seen it and related to it and commented on it - there is still an inner sense in us that we do connect to nature. ""And we should connect to nature."" Growing up on the shores of Lough Neagh left Tom with an abiding love for the natural environment. ""I remember as a child, I walked in the Lough, I swam in the Lough, I drank out of the Lough, I worked in the Lough and my family of generations before me did the same. ""Our ancestors would be appalled at the condition that we have left the space in, in  such a short time.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c075m1jgn75o

2025-12-24,'Farm tax turnaround is massive Christmas present',science,BBC,"A Shropshire farmer has said the announcement that the government's is ""a massive Christmas present for the majority of Shropshire's farmers"". At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026, ending the 100% tax relief that had been in place since the 1980s. Yesterday it was announced that the planned threshold would increase from £1m to £2.5m - it follows months of protests by farmers and concern from some Labour backbenchers. ""It was totally unexpected,"" said Richard Yates, who farms in Bridgnorth and is also on the national NFU council. ""I accept that for some of the larger farmers that this will not help the real big boys, but for huge swathes of Shropshire's farmers it's great news,"" Mr Yates said. ""We've had a concerted lobbying campaign the last 14 months."" About half the farms that would have been affected will now be exempt. In an announcement put out after MPs had left Parliament for the Christmas recess, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: ""We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms."" ""It's only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain's rural communities, "" she said. ""As a grassroots farmer myself, the ramifications for this unprecedented increase in APR would have more of an affect than Brexit,"" said Mr Yates, who has a beef, sheep and arable farm. ""[It] Would dissuade many of our very capable youngsters from even wanting to enter the industry."" He said that farmers now had spoken to Labour MPs about the issue. ""We do have great links now, extensive links with Labour MPs, and they're clearly aware that if they don't change their positions, they aren't going to get re-elected in three years' time."" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the fight ""isn't finished"" and vowed to push to have tax lifted from other family businesses. The Liberal Democrats demanded that the government scraps the tax in full and would submit amendments in the new year to bring it down. Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice described it as a ""cynical climbdown"" and called for the government to abolish the tax completely.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20kv62y03no

On Tuesday, the government said it from £1m to £2.5m for the 20% tax it announced in April. Labour MP for Truro and Falmouth Jayne Kirkham defended the government's U-turn and said the new threshold ""would exempt the vast majority of our working family farmers"". Maria Warne-Elston, 23, a fifth generation farmer in Cornwall, said the new threshold was ""definitely a step in the right direction"" but a higher level was needed. Ms Warne-Elston said: ""It still leaves out a lot of farms over the value of £5m - which isn't hard to beat because farms nowadays are more than likely going to have to have a value between £5m and £10m in order to make any livelihood.

2025-12-25,Fishermen's choirs sing on amid 'dwindling' numbers,science,BBC,"About 35 miles (56 km) up the coast, members of the Men of Staithes choir, what was once known as Staithes Fishermen's Choir, are also preparing for their next concert. The roots of both choirs date back to the 19th Century, but, despite their long, proud and fascinating histories, at the end of 2025 their numbers are dwindling and there are perhaps doubts about their long-term future. These days, neither choir requires members to be fishermen, and both say they really need new and younger members so their centuries-old traditions do not die. Francis Appleby, chairman of Filey Fishermen's Choir, joined the group over half a century ago at the age of 29. A former fisherman like his dad and grandad, he remembers seeing the choir's performances at St Sepulchre Street Church in Scarborough's old town where his dad was organist - and was clearly inspired by what he saw. ""They'd pass my dad a book and ask him to play for them,"" he recalls. Much like his dad, Mr Appleby plays the piano and organ for the choir and he says the group still sings only hymns, true to the choir's original religious purpose. ""Our main purpose is to take the Christian message to all through the old hymns we sing, like our predecessors did,"" he said. Mr Appleby says the group continues its traditions dating from when Filey's ""rough-living, drunken fishermen"" converted to Christianity in the 1820s. Alan Botterill, a singer and historian, says the choir's rich Christian heritage dates back to when Filey was a somewhat ""desperate and dangerous"" place. Mr Botterill explains that a preacher called John Oxtoby was even once chased away from the town ""by people throwing dried skate at him"". ""Filey in the 1800s was lawless and three times dead,"" Mr Botterill said. ""There was no Christian witness in the town, and a lot of superstition."" However, Mr Botterill explains that Oxtoby returned to convert Filey's fishermen to Christianity and the choir was eventually born as a result of that. Increasingly larger chapels were built using seamen's wages - and that is where the roots of Filey Fishermen's Choir are to be found, he says. But, while Mr Appleby, who is now nearly 80, joins his fellow choir members in their distinctive Filey-pattern ganseys to rehearse every Saturday, he says he worries for the ensemble's future. The total membership of Filey Fishermen's Choir now stands at ""14 if we're at full strength all together"", he says. ""We're finding it very difficult to get new members,"" Mr Appleby admits. ""We go through good times and less good times."" The choir at Staithes can also trace its heritage back to the 1800s, starting with men singing on the harbourside before church. Member Lee Jackson, who is a ship's pilot for the River Tees and also volunteers for the RNLI, says things have changed a great deal in Staithes since the group was founded as a fishermen's choir. ""They gathered before church on the seafront on Sundays and sang, then went up the street into their different chapels. That's how our choir formed,"" Mr Jackson explains. He says that in the 1980s, when his parents ran the pub in which the choir rehearsed, it had about 20 members - and there were probably even more members ""further back when more people lived in the village"". ""When it started, Staithes was a busy seafaring fishing hub with 100 or so fishing boats. Now only a couple of us have boats,"" he says. Currently 12-strong, with its oldest member 100 years old, the membership of the Men of Staithes choir is actually now up from a low of about six members at one point. Previously the Staithes Fishermen's Choir, it changed to its current name a while ago in a bid to show ""all are welcome, you don't have to be a fisherman to join"". However, in 2025, the choir's repertoire remains rooted in fishing traditions, though its members now sing more shanty-style pieces in an effort to appeal to younger generations. ""We often do a mix but there has to be a sea connection, but what we sing depends on who we perform to and where we perform,"" Mr Jackson says. ""Most sea songs, whether hymns or shanties, are inevitably superstitious and religious because of the danger of sea fishing - relying on the weather and good fortune for catching for many of them. ""A lot of the hymns are about God and Jesus showing people the way home too:  'pilot me, keep me safe'."" When asked about the future of the choir, Mr Jackson, who, at 50, considers himself the ""baby"" of the group, says: ""We'll just see what happens."" ""We want to keep the choir going obviously, but we're quite a laid-back group so we aren't vigorously pushing a recruitment drive,"" he adds. Between Staithes and Filey another small shanty group is also active. Marine scientist Magnus Johnson started the group near Scarborough with his neighbour and hurdy-gurdy player Ian Waughman. ""We sort of lead, but it's very informal. Anyone can suggest anything any time,"" Mr Johnson explains. Also including women among its membership, about seven singers meet weekly, usually in a pub or at someone's house. They focus on shanties as ""they're memorable, written for anyone to sing"", Mr Johnson says. ""They're work songs. Some have a long pause - if you're hauling a rope, there's a slow rhythm like 'heave away, haul away'. ""Others, like while working the capstan [for pulling in ropes], have a very different rhythm."" Mr Johnson, who grew up in Shetland, where he sailed, fished, dived and played the fiddle, says his dad had a small boat and they often went scallop fishing. He says he started singing because he loved music as much as the sea and his favourite song is Bones in the Ocean, a lament about lost friends. That song ""rings true"" because he was at sea when his boat's sister-ship sank, drowning 15 men, Mr Johnson explains. Meanwhile, Mr Jackson, from the Men of Staithes choir, says despite ""dwindling"" memberships in many such choirs, an important thing to remember is that all the singers love their groups - and their audiences do, too. ""There's a bit of adrenaline that comes from performing in front of people,"" he says. ""You come away feeling elated and it's really sociable, too.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnqpwe4w9o
2025-12-26,Christmas recycling tips issued by councils,science,BBC,"People have been urged to take the right approach when it comes to getting rid of waste and recycling after Christmas. Advice has been issued by Devon County Council and Cornwall Council about what households should do with items such as cards, batteries, wrapping paper and Christmas trees. Council bosses have said people should make sure items destined for the bin can be recycled or even find a creative idea to reuse them - including leftover food or old electrical gadgets. Waste collection dates are also changing across both counties, with households advised to check with their local authority when their bins will be picked up. Liz Jarvis, a senior waste manager at Devon County Council, told the wrapping paper and Christmas cards could usually be recycled if they were not covered in plastic or glitter. Ms Jarvis added food was a ""number one nemesis"" in terms of waste, with a 2022 analysis showing roughly a third of black bin waste as food. ""If you think you've bought something you don't really need, then don't forget that it can most likely be frozen and used another day,"" she said. A reminder has been issued by both councils about not putting old batteries in rubbish bins as ""Take them to a supermarket or your local household waste and recycling centre for recycling,"" Cornwall Council said. Ms Jarvis added some electrical items could be taken to repair cafes - where people can take items to be fixed - to get a new lease of life. Ms Jarvis said Christmas trees could also be recycled, with some councils offering special collections. She said certain size restrictions applied for the collections, and those with trees that were more than 6ft (1.82m) tall should consider taking them to their local recycling centre. Ms Jarvis added people could consider keeping a tree in their garden to get further enjoyment out of it. ""We keep our tree in the garden for as long as possible,"" Ms Jarvis said. ""The longest time we've had it there is until May, and we usually put bird food in it and they love it.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23e55e117do
2025-12-26,Should a top Russian archaeologist face trial for digging in occupied Crimea?,science,BBC,"A Russian archaeologist detained in Poland is at the centre of an intense debate over the role of museums and experts and the role they play in Kremlin war propaganda. Alexander Butyagin is under arrest in Warsaw, awaiting a Polish court decision on a request to extradite him to Ukraine. Until now, courts across Europe have been reluctant to extradite Russians to Ukraine, citing the European Convention on Human Rights. Butyagin's case has divided opinion. A senior scholar at the Hermitage, Russia's largest art museum in St Petersburg, he has led the museum's expedition at the site of Myrmekion in Crimea since 1999, well before Russia's illegal landgrab of Ukraine's southern peninsula in 2014. Supporters argue his work has helped preserve Crimea's ancient heritage, but critics say he is no better than a looter of Ukrainian history making the most of Russia's occupation. Myrmekion dates back to the 6th Century BC, when the Ancient Greeks settled in Crimea as democracy was being born in Athens. Butyagin's expedition has uncovered hundreds of ancient coins at the site, some from Alexander the Great's period in the 4th Century BC. His expedition continued after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, and a criminal case was opened against him by Ukrainian authorities for working there without authorisation. In November 2024, he was placed on a wanted list, and in April 2025 a Kyiv court ordered his arrest in absentia. Butyagin is accused of illegal excavations and ""illegal partial destruction"" of an archaeological complex. Under the 2nd Protocol to the Hague Convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict, occupying authorities ""shall prohibit and prevent"" any archaeological excavations with only a few, narrow exceptions. Both Poland and Ukraine are parties to the protocol, while Russia is not. Excavations, however ethical, amount to destruction if they take place without permission and under conditions of armed conflict, says Evelina Kravchenko, a senior researcher at the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Butyagin ""violated the Hague Convention, and all his problems stem from that"", says Kravchenko, whose committee issued permits for Russian archaeologists to work in Crimea before its annexation. Butyagin told Russian media last year he was ""simply doing the work we've devoted our lives to"", and that his main goal was preserving monuments. The Hermitage press office insisted Butyagin's work complied with all international legal and ethical norms ""regardless of geopolitical circumstances."" A senior archaeologist from the museum told the BBC that Butyagin had followed the only path available for Russian archaeologists working in Crimea. ""A Russian archaeologist, if he wants to continue his research, has no opportunity to obtain permits from the Ukrainian side, but must obtain them from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation,"" said the scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to comment on the case. Several Ukrainian sources have also accused Butyagin of ""looting"" objects by taking them to Russia, although these charges are not part of Ukraine's case. Both the archaeologist and the Hermitage insist all their finds remain in Crimea as they are transferred to the Eastern Crimean Museum in Kerch. They argue that objects can only be relocated to Russia temporarily for restoration or as exhibition loans. However, this violates Ukrainian law too, as all discoveries must go into Ukraine's museum fund. Under the terms of Russia's illegal annexation, the Eastern Crimean Museum collection has instead been made part of Russia's museum fund. Since the start of the war, several European courts have refused Ukraine's requests to extradite Russians, citing potential risks under the European Convention, which prohibits politically motivated persecution, violations of the right to a fair trial, and torture and inhuman treatment of detainees. Even if the Polish court deciding Butyagin's case does find sufficient grounds to extradite him, it might not go ahead, says Gleb Bogush, a researcher at the Institute for International Peace and Security Law at the University of Cologne. Last June, Denmark's Supreme Court ruled against extraditing to Ukraine a Russian national suspected of espionage for Moscow. Gleb Bogush says it is primarily the Russian state and its officials that are responsible for Crimean excavations, rather than Butyagin, because it was not up to archaeologists to decide whether the Hermitage expedition should continue. A senior Hermitage employee told the BBC that ""a field archaeologist cannot be a citizen of the world; he deals with officials, obtaining permits and has to look for funding and volunteers"". Butyagin has attracted support not just from the Kremlin but from Russians who oppose Putin and the war. ""The claims being made against him are absurd,"" said Arseny Vesnin, an exiled journalist and historian. He said Butyagin had ensured conservation and preservation of the site he was excavating. Others maintain that artefacts would have been looted by criminals and sold on the black market if Russian archaeologists had refused to work in Crimea. That does not justify their actions, says Samuel Andrew Hardy, a leading British criminologist specialising in the protection of cultural property in conflict zones. Official excavations do not always stop criminal digs from taking place, he argues. Some looters target sites that have already been excavated. Hardy says all that Butyagin's supporters are doing is arguing that ultimately Russia should just be allowed to carry on doing what it wants regardless of the war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623rvzjjd2o

2025-12-25,India's solar boom faces a hidden waste problem,science,BBC,"India's rapid solar energy expansion is widely hailed as a success. But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition? In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages. Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme. Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed. Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled. Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels. India has no official data on solar waste, but a study estimated around 100,000 tonnes by 2023, rising to 600,000 tonnes by 2030. For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis. A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than by 2047. Managing this would require almost 300 dedicated recycling facilities and an investment of $478 (£362m) over the next two decades. ""Most of India's large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,"" says Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray. India's solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the may generate 170,000–1 million tonnes and China nearly one million tonnes by 2030, following rapid solar expansion in the 2010s. The policy landscape, however, differs significantly. In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a patchwork of state rules. China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework. In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life. Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle. Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials. The BBC has contacted India's renewable energy ministry for comment. ""Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,"" says environment expert Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka. Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without opportunities. ""As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to process it,"" Mr Pahwa says. Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by 2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says CEEW. India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the study. Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts. Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India's solar goals. The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste collection into solar business models. Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka. ""Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste tomorrow,"" he warned.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6x75x4j02o
2025-12-27,"Rescued bear pair now 'thriving', sanctuary says",science,BBC,"Staff caring for two brown bears rescued from a small cage in Azerbaijan have said the pair are now relaxed and thriving. Benji and Balu were thin and frail when they took their first steps into their new enclosure in Wildheart Animal Sanctuary on the Isle of Wight in June this year. But Lucie Francis, who looks after them, said they had reached a healthier weight and become the main attraction of the rescue centre. The bears also celebrated their first Christmas on the island in style, being treated to colourful gifts full of food hidden around their pen. ""They've really packed on some pounds, and you can see it in the contrast in the images when we look back,"" said Ms Francis. ""It's like different bears, it's quite incredible."" Shortly after arriving in June, the bears had smashed up part of their enclosure. Ms Francis said: ""Benji is definitely the naughty one out of the two, he's broken and dug things up and been quite adventurous ""So it's kept us on our toes, having to repair everything in his wake. ""Balu on the other hand is much more relaxed, he just sort of chills out in the background."" Ms Francis said before the bears got settled, the team did not know what to expect, but suspected they might show some behaviour associated with trauma. ""We did see some of [that] to start with, but it really rapidly reduced once they became comfortable in their environment,"" she said. ""It's been lovely to see them relax and thrive."" And she said the two are getting along with each other ""like siblings"" although they did squabble sometimes. ""I think they've stolen everybody's hearts, honestly,"" she said. ""They've really been the main attraction at the sanctuary - everybody's been desperate to see them.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vmq1d1p8qo
2025-12-27,The cafe that started a climate movement over a cup of tea,science,BBC,"Jess Pepper is helping out at the latest Climate Café in Dunkeld and Birnam, 10 years since she opened the very first one in this village in Perthshire. As she pours out cups of tea, she explains what it is all about. ""A Climate Café, very simply, is a community-led space that brings people together to drink, chat and act on climate,"" she explains. Although the idea is now firmly established, she admits she was apprehensive before that first meeting. ""I wasn't sure whether people would want to talk about climate in that way and how they would feel but actually what we learned very quickly was that people really valued that space,"" she said. Since founding the Climate Café in 2015, she now co-ordinates its global network. It's a simple idea - have a cuppa and talk about climate change. But does having a chat in Perthshire really make any difference at all to this global problem? That question crossed the mind of attendee Lachlan McEwan. ""I was a bit sceptical to start with,"" he says. ""And then I got invited by Jess to a meeting and had a cup of coffee, and suddenly realised it was a safe space for you to say what you thought. ""Out of that, we managed to get quite a lot of different groups together,"" he adds. One of those groups was the foodshare which Fiona Ritchie, sitting opposite, says makes her feel like she's making a difference. ""We wanted to make sure that the village took on a consciousness about food waste. We set up two stations on either side of the village where cafes and individuals bring excess food,"" she says. Alasdair Wylie was at one of the very first meetings of the Climate Café . He's been a local businessman for many years and energy efficiency is very important to him. In 2018, the group wanted to try to reduce the amount of water used in the village. Over the next year, shops, businesses, and residents managed to save one million litres of water using a variety of gadgets including shower timers. And in 2019, Dunkeld & Birnam received the award of Scotland's first Water Efficient Village from Scottish Water. Listening to the climate conversations over tea, coffee and biscuits is 13-year-old Dougie. He says: ""The reason Climate Café started is because we saw in our community that not many people were talking about climate."" Ten years on, the cafes are popping up all over the world. Amanda Katili Niode speaks passionately from Jakarta in Indonesia about what the climate café network means to her. ""For me, Climate Café is a caring and human space. ""It allows people to talk openly about the climate crisis, our worries, our griefs, and our hopes, without judgment and without needing to be experts,"" she says. Climate Café is also popular in Lagos in Nigeria. Saviour Iwezue says the cafe is more than conversation. ""It is where we really get to understand the everyday concerns and everyday experiences of people that make up this global issue,"" she says. Thousands of miles away in Perthshire they're having some of the same conversations. The group in Dunkeld and Birnam says they'll also keep acting locally in the hope that they can make a difference globally.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75vrr2zwq7o
2025-12-27,Our tigers want your Christmas trees,science,BBC,"Wildlife parks are appealing for donations of Christmas trees so they can turn festive leftovers into animal toys and treats. Animal farms across East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire use real Christmas trees as food for alpacas and goats, hiding spaces for wallabies and air fresheners for big cats. Steve Nichols, the chief executive of Lincolnshire Wildlife Park, in Friskney, said it was important to find some form of enrichment for rehomed animals and Christmas trees ""offer everything"". Natalie Neadley, the owner of Ings Park Alpacas, near North Cave, described trees as a great source of nutrition and vitamins for the animals. Alpacas eat pretty much everything off the Christmas trees, Ms Neadley said. ""They're a good scratching post, they worm the animals as well and they have high vitamins in them, so they're really all-round good for the animals,"" she said. The goats nibble the leaves off and use the branches as a horn-scratching post, as well as headbutting them and jumping on them. Ms Neadley said people could drop off donations at the farm, while the Newport Young Farmers group will also be collecting them. Mr Nichols said donating the trees to wildlife parks was more ""eco-friendly"" than burning them or putting them into landfill. He said meerkats enjoyed foraging in the trees and tortoises loved dragging them about and using them as a battering ram, knocking into fences with them. ""These animals are obviously captive animals, we're here to look after animals that are unwanted, so we just try and make sure to give them the best possible life,"" he said. ""We've just got to find some form of enrichment and Christmas trees are amazing, they offer everything."" After animals have played or nibbled on the trees, staff mulch them and put them into garden beds around the park. Mr Nichols said people could donate Christmas trees at a drop-off point in the car park. ""It starts off with a tree and then you go and walk up there and you can't see behind it because there's such a pile of trees, but then, amazingly, they go as quickly as they come."" Jamie Mintram, co-owner of Ark Wildlife Park, in Stickney, said: ""Christmas trees are fantastically useful."" African pygmy goats ""absolutely love Christmas trees"" and will ""strip them bare in minutes"". ""They have got incredibly tough palates and they all quite happily chow down on needles. It's one of their favourite things,"" he added. Meerkats and Arctic foxes use the trees for exploring and climbing, while the Eurasian lynx loves the smell of the pine, rolling on it daily. He has asked people to email the park before donating trees. Tiny Steps Petty Farm in Bourne, a therapeutic farm for people with disabilities or mental health issues, is also appealing for used Christmas trees. Tracey Hall, owner of the farm, said all of their animals, including alpacas, wallabies, sheep and pigs, love the trees. She said: ""They don't just enjoy the actual Christmas tree greenery, they like the branches and they like to use it as scratching posts as well."" Ms Hall said someone had already donated a tree to Dec the wallaby, who has a lot of trees in his enclosure so he can hide and rummage around.

2025-12-27,Sally the sloth relaxes into her new zoo home,science,BBC,"Sally, a seven-year-old Linne's Two-Toed sloth, is easing into her new home after a near 250-mile journey up the A1 from her old abode. The animal arrived at Northumberland Zoo near Morpeth two weeks ago from Hamerton in Cambridgeshire. She is the size of a small dog and is already proving to be popular with visitors and fans of the zoo online. Zoo manager Maxine Bradley said: ""We were blown away by how many people have actually watched our videos on social media."" In their natural habitat in the hot and humid forests of south and Central America sloths are notoriously slow, although not necessarily sleepy, and enjoy long hours of rest between munching on leaves. Sally's new enclosure is artificially heated to about 25C (77F) with a stream to keep the air moist and is shared with small primates like pygmy marmosets and a rodent called the agouti. While sloths have been made famous by characters such as the clumsy and endearing Sid in Ice Age, there is a real world purpose for Sally's journey to the chilly north of England. Ms Bradley said: ""The sloth is part of an endangered species breeding programme. ""Sally being here is a great way of putting the message out about the rainforests."" Linne's two-toed sloths have 46-ribs, spend their lives hanging upside down and only come down from the trees once a week to go to the toilet.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzexj0x23o
2025-12-26,Villagers' campaign helps buy treasure hoard,science,BBC,"An early medieval treasure hoard will go on public display next year after villagers led a fundraising campaign to keep it in Oxfordshire. The 21 complete and fragmentary silver pennies, known as sceattas, were discovered by a metal detectorist in 2018 in Stoke Row, near Henley. Dating back to the mid-seventh and eighth centuries, Stoke Row parish councillors, businesses and the Nettlebed Estate helped raise the £1,300 needed for the Oxfordshire Museum Service to acquire them through the Treasure Act. Neil Fawcett, Oxfordshire County Council's deputy leader, said: ""These treasures are particularly special as they're the very first hoard of sceattas in the museum's collection."" He added: ""The size of the hoard, and the date, make it one of national and regional importance too. ""We'd like to thank the individual donors, businesses and Friends of the Oxfordshire Museum who supported this fundraising campaign to bring this magnificent hoard into public ownership for all to enjoy. ""Without their support we may not have been successful in our fundraising endeavours. The help and support of Stoke Row parish councillors is also very much valued and appreciated.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp89g1dgx80o
2025-12-27,Life on the edge and the villages lost to the sea,science,BBC,"""It was just a story you talked about as children, sort of a fairy tale,"" recalls 90-year-old Shirley, who grew up in Withernsea in the 1940s. ""The story was that there'd been a village or a settlement out there, and that it had eroded into the sea, and you could hear the church bells. I'd like to think I believed it, but I'm not sure. ""Quite a lot of villages have been lost on that coast, so it's possibly true."" Shirley moved to Withernsea from Hull in 1939 at the age of four. She lived there until she got married at St Nicholas Church in 1958. She believes the tale of the bells may have originated from St Peter's Church in Owthorne, just north of Withernsea, where large parts of the town were washed away in the early 19th Century. Shirley says she would often see ""lumps falling off the cliffs"" as she walked along the coast, and even at the end of her road, Princes Avenue. Maps stored at East Riding Archives show the impact of erosion on the East Yorkshire coast dating as far back as the 16th Century. A map created by Christopher Saxton in 1577 shows a number of hamlets and villages that went on to succumb to the sea, including places such as Dimlington, Owthorne and Waxholme. By 1786, a map produced by John Tuke shows Hornsea Beck had completely disappeared. Dr Caitlin Green, who specialises in history, archaeology and place names, said 38 houses had been destroyed in Hornsea Beck since 1547. By 1695, all but one or two houses had washed away. Fast-forward to 1912 and a map showing the lost towns of East Yorkshire, by Thomas Sheppard, shows locations that used to be inland, such as Old Kilnsea, Ravenspurn and Out Newton. As a whole, the maps are visual evidence of more than 30 locations disappearing from the East Yorkshire coast in the past 400 years. Hannah Stamp, who works at the archives, said: ""It is very worrying to see, in particular for communities living along the coast who are directly impacted by this every day."" David Whitaker, landlord of The Crown and Anchor in Kilnsea, knows only too well what life is like living with the elements. The 59-year-old's pub is just a stone's throw from the North Sea, which he says can be ""pretty bad"" at times. ""When I take the dogs down there it can be a cliff one day and the next I can walk straight on to the beach, it's shifting that much,"" he says. ""You don't really know year to year what your customer base is going to be, you just keep going."" With power cuts and wi-fi issues also causing a nuisance, what makes living on the edge of a coast worthwhile? ""It's so peaceful. The beauty and the charm just trump everything,"" he says. ""In winter, it can be very bleak and the weather can be atrocious. On the other side of it, we get some of the best sunsets in the country."" Despite having flood defences installed nearby in 2013, sea still sprays on to the pub during storms. ""When you open the curtains in the morning, it's like being at sea,"" he adds. ""You need to be a certain type of person to enjoy that, it could be daunting otherwise."" And what about the church bells? David says it's a story that continues to be told more than 80 years on from when Shirley first heard it. ""For many years you could still see the spire on a clear day above the water,"" he says. ""At certain tides, you can hear the bells chiming. I haven't heard them personally, but that's the tale."" The Environment Agency says the risk of eroding coastline along the East Yorkshire Coast is ""likely to increase in the coming years due to climate change, sea level rise and increased storminess"". A spokesperson adds: ""The Changing Coasts East Riding Project is part of the government's £200m Flood and Coastal Innovation Programme, which is driving forward flood and coastal resilience to support adaptation to an ever-changing climate.""

2025-10-28,"These robots can clean, exercise - and care for you in old age. Would you trust them to?",science,BBC,"""We're not trying to build Terminator,"" jokes Rich Walker, director of Shadow Robot, the firm that made them. Bespectacled, with long hair and a beard and moustache, he seems more like a latter-day hippy than a tech whizz, and he is clearly proud as he shows me around his firm. ""We set out to build the robot that helps you, that makes your life better, your general-purpose servant that can do anything around the home, do all the housework..."" But there's a deeper ambition: to address one of the UK's most pressing challenges - the escalating crisis in social care. There were 131,000 vacancies for adult care workers in England, a report by charity, Skills for Care, found last year. And in all, around two million people aged 65 and over in England are living with unmet care needs, according to Age UK. By 2050, one in four people in the UK is expected to be aged 65 or over, potentially putting more strain still on the care system. The previous government announced a £34m investment in developing robots that could potentially be used to give care. It went as far as saying, in 2019, that ""within the next 20 years, autonomous systems like… robots will become a normal part of our lives, transforming the way we live, work and travel."" Could this ""techno-solutionism"" - which sounds more like something out of a sci-fi film - really be the solution? And would you really trust your elderly relatives, or yourself when you're at your most vulnerable with what is essentially a very strong machine? Japan offers a peek into a future with robots living among us. Ten years ago, its government began offering subsidies to robot manufacturers to develop and popularise the use of robots in care homes - fuelled in part by an ageing population and relative lack of care home staff. Dr James Wright, an AI specialist and visiting professor at Queen Mary University of London, spent seven months observing them. And specifically, looking at how well they worked in a Japanese care home. In all, three types of robots were studied: the first, called HUG, was designed by Fuji Corporation in Japan and looked like a highly sophisticated walking frame. It had support pads that people could lean right into, and it helped carers lift people from bed to, say, a wheelchair or the toilet. The second, meanwhile, looked a bit like a baby seal and was called Paro. This robot, intended to stimulate dementia patients, was trained to respond to being stroked through movements and sounds. The third was a small friendly-looking humanoid robot called Pepper. It could give instructions and also demonstrate exercises by moving its arms - and was used to lead exercise classes in the care home. Even before he started observing them, Dr Wright had bought into the hype a little. ""I was expecting that the robots would be easily adopted by care workers who were massively overstretched and extremely busy in their work. ""What I found was, almost the opposite."" He discovered that, in fact, the biggest drain on the time of care home staff was cleaning and recharging the robots - and above all troubleshooting when they went wrong. ""After several weeks the care workers decided the robots were more trouble than they were worth and used them less and less, because they were too busy to use them,"" he tells me. ""HUG had to be moved around all the time to get [it] out of the residents' way. Paro caused distress to one of the residents who had become overly attached to it. And they couldn't follow Pepper's exercise routines because it was too short for people to see - and they couldn't hear it properly because its voice was too high-pitched."" The teams behind the robots had their own responses to Dr Wright's research. The developers behind HUG says that since then they've refined the design to make it more compact and user-friendly. Paro's creator Takanori Shibata said that Paro has been used for 20 years and pointed to trials that demonstrated ""clinical evidence of [the] therapeutic effects"". Pepper is now owned by a different company and its software has been substantially updated. And yet the study was not without merit. Mr Walker of Shadow Robot is adamant that the use of robots in care should not be dismissed. For one thing, he argues, the next generation of them will be much more capable. Praminda Caleb-Solly, a professor at the University of Nottingham is determined to make these robots work well in practice. ""We are trying to get these robots out of the labs into the real world,"" she says. To do this she has set up a network, Emergence, to help connect robot makers with businesses and individuals who will use them - and to find out from elderly people themselves what they'd want from robots. Some people have said they want robots with voice interaction and, understandably, a non-threatening appearance. Others want a ""cute design"". But many requests come down to the practical way they'd like the robot to adapt to their changing needs - and for the robot to charge and clean itself. ""We don't want to look after the robot – we want the robot to look after us,"" said one person who was asked the question. Some businesses in the UK are testing out robots too. Home care provider, Caremark has been trialling Genie, a small voice-activated robot, with some people who use their services in Cheltenham. One man who has early-onset dementia explained he enjoyed asking Genie to play Glenn Miller songs. Overall, however, reactions have been ""like Marmite,"" according to director Michael Folkes – with some people loving Genie, and others less complimentary. But Mr Folkes also stresses these devices aren't about replacing people. ""We're trying to build a future where carers have more time to care."" Back in the laboratory of the Shadow Robot Company in London, Rich Walker points out another big challenge: mastering the perfect robotic hand. ""For the robot to be useful, it needs to have the same ability to interact with the world as [a] human does,"" he explains. ""And for that it needs human-like dexterity."" The robot hand Mr Walker shows me certainly seems nimble. It's made from metal and plastic, and fitted with 100 sensors, with the dexterity and strength of a human hand. Each finger moves to touch its thumb smoothly, quickly and precisely, finishing with an 'OK' to sign off. It can even do a Rubik's Cube, one-handed. Yet it is still a long way from doing the more delicate tasks, like using a pair of scissors or picking up smaller, more fragile objects. ""The way we use a pair of scissors is quite mind-blowing when you think about it,"" Mr Walker says. ""If you try and analyse what happens, you're using your sense of touch in subtle and precise ways and receiving feedback, which makes you adjust the way you cut. How do you tell a robot how to do that?"" Mr Walker's team, together with 26 other engineering firms, are working to design a hand more like ours - it's part of what's known as the Robot Dexterity Programme. It's one of the projects run by a government agency called the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) that sets out to support scientific research that is high risk (because it might well not work) but also high-reward for its potential to transform society. The project's leader, Professor Jenny Read, explains they are looking at how animals move as part of this, to better inform the design not only of the hand but to inform a complete rethink of how robots are made. ""One of the very striking things about animal bodies is their grace and efficiency, evolution has ensured that, in fact. ""I think gracefulness really is a form of efficiency."" Guggi Kofod, an engineer turned entrepreneur from Denmark, is trying to develop artificial muscles for robots that can be used instead of motors. His Denmark-based firm, Pliantics, is at an early stage of development, but have made the key breakthrough of finding a material  that seems to do the job and is durable. He is driven by deeply personal reasons too. ""Several people near me died from dementia very recently,"" he explains. ""I see from the people who are caring for dementia patients, and it is very challenging. ""So, if we could build systems that help them to not be scared, and that help them live at least a decent level of life… That's incredibly motivating for me."" The muscles his firm designs are made from a soft material that extends and contracts, much like real muscles, when an electric current is applied. Guggi Kofod is working with Shadow Robot, as part of the ARIA project to develop a robotic human-sized hand whose artificial muscles could give it a more precise and delicate grip. The ultimate aim is for it to detect small pressure changes when it grips an object, and to know when to stop squeezing, just as the skin on fingertips does. Dr Wright, who observed the robots in Japan, has one final concern. That is, if they catch on, robots could end up making life worse for human carers. ""The only way that economically you can make this work is to pay the care workers less and have much larger care homes, which are standardised to make it easy for robots to operate in,"" he argues. ""As a result, there would be more robots taking care of people, with care workers being paid a minimum wage to service the robots, which is the opposite of this vision that robots are going to give time back to care workers to spend quality time with residents, to talk."" Other experts are more positive. ""It's going to be a huge industry, given the deficit we have in the workforce right now. The demand for carers as our population ages will be huge,"" argues Gopal Ramchurn, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton. He is also CEO of Responsible AI, which is involved in trying to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are safe, reliable, and trustworthy. But he cites Elon Musk's  Optimus humanoid robot, which served drinks and mingled at a Tesla event last year, as a sign that - like it or not - the robots are coming. ""We are trying to anticipate that future, before the big tech companies come in and deploy these things without asking us what we think about them,"" he adds. So now is the time to develop the right regulations to ensure that the robots work for us, he argues, rather than the other way round. ""We need to be ready for that future.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdzyyglq5o
2025-12-30,Photographing the hidden world of slime mould,science,BBC,"Welcome to the world of slime mould. These images, captured by photographer Barry Webb, provide a close-up view of single-celled slime mould organisms. A view that would not be possible with the naked eye. Using a high-powered macro lens, and a composite of stills, Barry is able to reveal the tiny structures, which can grow anywhere from forests to deserts. Barry has won awards for his work, which is mainly focused west of London, including the recent people's choice award in the macro section of the Barry said he ""didn't know they existed"" before he was introduced to the world of slime mould in 2019. A gardener by trade, but a keen hobby photographer - the Covid lockdown saw Barry spend more time outside hunting for these organisms. ""It's not fungi, it's not a plant, it's not animal. It's more closely related to an amoeba,"" Barry explains. His photography focuses on the fruiting bodies of the slime mould, where the colour and drama are most intense, and from where spores are released. Barry explains how the slime mould feed off bacteria, algae and types of fungi and are an important part of the ecosystem. The RHS says slime mould has been used in some ""incredible practical applications"", including Taking photos of slime mould is not a simple process, although technology has made it much easier in recent years. Barry explains that due to the size of the subject, ""one picture would not do them justice, you can get virtually nothing in focus"". He describes how he uses a technique called focus bracketing, where dozens of photos are taken. ""You take multiple pictures, sometimes over 100 and it takes tiny little slithers of focus, and then you put all those into software, and that creates your final image."" Years ago Barry would have to adjust the focus for each of those 100 photos, but now it does it for him. ""It's all clever stuff,"" he tells me.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d9409p76qo
2025-12-22,'Year of octopus' declared after warmer seas lead to record UK numbers,science,BBC,"A wildlife charity has declared 2025 ""the Year of the Blooming Octopus"" after record numbers were spotted off the south-west coast of England. In its annual marine review the Wildlife Trusts says octopus numbers were this summer at their highest level since 1950. Warmer winters, which are linked to climate change, are thought to be responsible for the population spike, which is known as a ""bloom"". The charity's findings are backed up by official figures which show that more than 1,200 tonnes of octopus was caught by fishermen in UK waters in the summer of 2025. It's a dramatic increase on previous years. Only once since 2021 has more than 200 tonnes of octopus been landed. Experts say most of those spotted are Octopus vulgaris a species commonly seen in the warmer Mediterranean Sea. Wildlife Trusts volunteers in Cornwall and Devon reported an increase in sightings of more than 1,500 percent on 2023 figures along one stretch of the south coast. ""It really has been exceptional,"" says Matt Slater from the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. ""We've seen octopuses jet-propelling themselves along. We've seen octopuses camouflaging themselves, they look just like seaweeds. ""We've seen them cleaning themselves. And we've even seen them walking, using two legs just to nonchalantly cruise away from the diver underwater."" It's unclear at this point whether the rise in numbers is permanent or cyclical,  which would mean octopus numbers returning to more typical levels after this year's bloom. The eight-armed cephalopods eat shellfish such as lobster, crabs and scallops so the Wildlife Trusts warn that if population numbers remain high, both fishing and eating habits may have to change. ""They are having an impact on those (shellfish) species around our shores. And as a consequence, they will be having an impact on our fishing industry who target those species as well,"" Ruth Williams the head of marine for The Wildlife Trusts told the BBC's Today programmme. ""But there are opportunities and our fishing industry are doing some research into that at the moment to try and evolve with the changing fisheries that we're seeing as a result of climate change."" crab landings down on previous years but catches of lobster, crawfish and scallops stable. Alongside good news for octopus lovers, the Wildlife Trusts' marine review contains more sobering news. The Trusts say this year was bookended by environmental disasters, with a collision between an oil tanker and a container ship in the North Sea in March spilling There was some better news for wildlife elsewhere, with a record 46,000 puffins recorded on Skomer, Pembrokeshire, while the charismatic black and white bird has made a comeback on the Isle of Muck following conservation efforts by Ulster Wildlife Trust to remove invasive brown rats.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c709gz3k9k9o
2025-10-31,Bats are seeking sanctuary in churches - but they're making an unholy mess,science,BBC,"It's a job that can only be done under the cover of darkness. As night falls, the bat hunters make their way amongst the gravestones of Guestwick Church in Norfolk. The creaking door opens. Inside is the pitch black, deserted church and the team start to set up their specialist gear. Infrared and thermal cameras are carefully positioned, and audio detectors are set to bat friendly frequencies. The bats soon begin to emerge, darting and swooping up and down the aisles, the amplified sounds of their bat chatter filling the historic building. ""Many of these churches have been on these sites for probably 1,000 years, and probably as long as they've been standing they've had bats in them,"" says Diana Spencer, from the published in the British Ecological Society's journal People & Nature has found that these historic buildings are providing vital homes for the nocturnal animals. The research, based on citizen science surveys led by the Bat Conservation Trust, estimates that half of all churches in England - that's more than 8,000 -  have bats in them. And that figure rises to about 80% for older churches. ""They're basically like a man-made forest,"" says Spencer. ""Full of little nooks and crannies where they can roost, big open flight spaces, dry spaces inside, away from the rain, where they can fly around. It is really just an absolutely perfect environment."" There are two types of bats at Guestwick: Common Pipistrelles and Natterer's. They roost high up in the rafters. The Pipistrelles emerge first, flying around for a few minutes, before squeezing out through minute gaps around the church door. The Natterer's come out a little later, preferring to exit through small holes in the roof to get outside and find food. Without the help of the specialist cameras, the bats are near impossible to spot, lost in the darkness. About a third of the churches surveyed in the study had no idea that bats were living there. But in others, their presence was much more noticeable.  Bats can be messy houseguests. ""They're lovely, but they're problematic too,"" says Graeme Peart from St Margaret's Church, Saxlingham, just a few miles from Guestwick. He's responsible for the upkeep of the church - and says the bats started to become a nuisance about 15 years ago. ""There's the urine, the droppings,"" he says. ""One time there was a carpet leading up to the altar that became absolutely sodden with urine and droppings and had to be thrown away. They also destroyed the brass work."" Bats are legally protected in the UK, so it's generally not possible to remove them. But the church has worked with the Bats in Churches team to find a solution - they've built a sealed-off loft conversion above the vestry. Ecologist Phillip Parker sets up his ladder to show us inside. ""The idea is that the bats that are in the main body of the church will live in here, rather than in the church itself,"" he explains. It's kitted out with CCTV cameras, allowing the team to monitor the animal's behaviour. ""What we have found is certain weeks during the year there'll be a hundred bats in here, and then suddenly they will disappear,"" says Parker. ""We don't know where they go, but they disappear for about 10 days, and then they'll come back again. And without the CCTV, we never knew that."" A major construction project like this takes time, effort and money. The new loft, and the continued monitoring of the bats, has cost about £50,000, funded through the Heritage Lottery Fund and other partners. Diana Spencer says there are other less costly solutions and grants are on offer from the Bat Conservation Trust. ""On a simple level, you can use sheets or covers over areas where things might be damaged. You can put wax coating on things like brass so that the urine doesn't damage it."" She recommends that anyone who finds bats in a building should contact the It seems more bats are seeking sanctuary in churches. ""They're losing lots of habitat - lots of woodland,"" says Spencer. ""And we're also knocking down old buildings, making our homes warmer, more airtight - there are less places for them to go."" Church users are having to learn to live alongside these creatures of the night - and some parishes are even starting to see bats as more of a treat than a trick. ""We regularly see churches having bat nights and bat events,"" says Spencer. ""And they can be a really, really good way of reaching people, particularly in the local community, who might not come into a church for a service or prayer, but they'll come in to watch the bats, because people find them really, really fascinating.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vq5318dxo
2025-08-27,SpaceX pulls off Starship rocket launch in much-needed comeback,science,BBC,"SpaceX has pulled off a successful test flight of its newest generation rocket Starship, reversing a trend of disappointing failures. The world's largest and most powerful rocket blasted off from Texas just after 18:30 local time (00:30 BST) for a nail-biting 60-minute flight. Parts of the engine appeared to explode at one stage, and flaps on the side of the rocket caught fire and swung from side-to-side. US space agency Nasa plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon for its Artemis programme in 2027. ""Great work by the SpaceX team!!"", posted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on X, He will be welcoming the success after three Starship launches ended in spectacular failure this year, and one rocket Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket built to date. It is made up of a  booster called Super Heavy and the spacecraft Starship. The signs were positive from the start of Tuesday's test flight. All of the booster's 33 engines fired up, and after about seven minutes, the booster separated from the spacecraft and fell into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship continued to ascend, reaching a maximum height of almost 200km above Earth, before coasting around the planet. SpaceX said it intended to put the rocket under stress to test its limits, and parts of the rocket's flaps appeared to burn and swing wildly during the descent. The company has designed Starship to one day be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying people to the Moon and Mars. ""This was a great day for SpaceX, executing its full mission for the first time and deploying some test dummy satellites along the route,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at the Open University. He adds that SpaceX will have gathered a full set of data from take-off, cruising and landing, which is a big step forward for the company. The first version of the rocket had five successful launches, but all attempts to launch the newest version had ended in spectacular explosions. In March, one explosion grounded flights and But SpaceX did successfully execute the ""chopstick"" manoeuvre that caught the rocket booster in mechanical arms when it returned to Earth. It is high stakes for US space agency Nasa, too. It has contracted SpaceX to use a modified version of Starship to take humans to the Moon as part its Artemis programme in 2027, although most observers say that date is almost certain to slip. ""This is also a big step forward for Nasa's Artemis program, but there's still a lot of development work to happen to get this spacecraft ready and to be rated to carry humans safely to the Moon,"" Dr Barber says. Mr Musk wants Starship to be certified for human travel as early as next year, and has also suggested it will start un-crewed flights to Mars in the next 12 months. SpaceX's mantra has been to fail fast, learn fast. Rather than taking a cautious approach, it has always aimed to move quickly and when rockets have exploded, the company says it is simply a chance to collect performance data. But after three failures in a row this year, questions were being asked about the future of SpaceX and about whether Mr Musk had been spending too much time on US politics. The world's richest man was a key supporter of US President Donald Trump in the 2024 election campaign, and until a falling out in June, the two men were close allies. Starship returned to Earth battered and bruised on Tuesday but it was a big step forward for the company that needs to prove it can safely and reliably take humans to the Moon. Tuesday's success ""gets the programme back on track - getting to the Moon is another question,"" suggests Dr Ken Kremer, research scientist and founder of website Space UpClose. He says the US reaching the moon in 2027 is ""extremely unlikely. I don't want to say it's impossible but it's extremely unlikely"". The US is racing against China to be the first to return humans to the Moon, and some scientists say that even with Starship's progress, it is likely that China will win.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly69z9lwnno
2025-12-29,Loch records UK's most powerful earthquake in 2025,science,BBC,"Scotland recorded the UK's most powerful onshore earthquakes in 2025, according to the latest data. They happened hours apart on 20 October near Loch Lyon in Perth and Kinross, when a 3.7-magnitude tremor was shortly followed by a 3.6-magnitude one. The British Geological Survey (BGS) said 198 people ""felt"" the earthquake, some up to 60km (37.2 miles) away. They were among 309 earthquakes recorded across the UK up to 18 December, BGS seismologists said. One local resident described the Loch Lyon earthquake as feeling ""like an underground subway"" under their house, while another said ""the house shook and all the windows rattled"". Perthshire and the western Highlands were over the last 12 months, BGS figures revealed. The data showed 34 earthquakes happened near Loch Lyon between October and December. Dr Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS, said it was not surprising the region was the UK's earthquake capital, due to its position on the Highland Boundary Fault – which stretches from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, to Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire. He said: ""The west of Scotland is one of the more active parts of the UK. ""Some of this activity can be attributed to well-known geological faults like the Great Glen Fault and the Highland Boundary Fault. ""It is a reminder that small earthquakes happen all the time and it remains of critical importance that they are studied to help us understand the possible impact of the rare large earthquakes on major energy and infrastructure projects around the country."" The third largest onshore earthquake was one of on 3 December, which sparked nearly 700 ""felt reports"". A magnitude-four event in the UK and surrounding areas is typically recorded every three to four years, and a magnitude-five event happens every few decades. The most recent one occurred in 2008 in Lincolnshire. Magnitude-six earthquakes happen every few hundred years, the BGS said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lv54pv5jvo
2025-12-22,Hen cages and pig farrowing crates face ban,science,BBC,"The government is planning to end the use of hen cages as part of a raft of proposals to improve animal welfare standards in England. The measures also include moving away from the use of pig farrowing crates, which contain sows during birth and nursing to stop them rolling over onto their young. The National Farmers' Union said laws should also require imports to be produced to the same standards to prevent unfair competition for British farmers. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said the package of reforms, which include banning trail hunting and puppy farming, was ""the most ambitious animal welfare strategy in a generation"", but the Conservatives said it showed Labour did not care about rural Britain. The government aims to implement the new strategy by 2030. ""We've already acted to improve zoo standards, end puppy smuggling and protect livestock from dog attacks. Now, we're planning to ban caged hens, cruel snares, trail hunting, and curb low welfare dog breeding,"" Reynolds said. said it would ""transition to non-cage systems and consult on phasing out enriched 'colony' cages"" - which contain multiple chickens. It added that it would work with the farming industry to "" explore how to transition away from the use of farrowing crates to alternative systems"". As well as ending ""confinement systems"", the government is looking at outlawing controversial so-called ""Frankenchickens"" - a term used by animal welfare campaigners to describe fast-growing breeds. Anthony Field, head of Compassion in World Farming UK, said the government was ""raising the bar for farmed animal welfare"". Conventional battery cages for individual hens are already banned in the UK, where the RSPCA says an estimated 80% of hens are free range. The RSPCA's head of public affairs David Bowles said removing the final 20% of hens from cages should not pose a ""massive commercial problem"". NFU President Tom Bradshaw urged the government to ensure imported food was not produced at a lower standard than would be legal in the UK. He warned that this would lead to British farmers facing unfair competition from cheaper goods around the world. ""If we don't implement the changes that we want to have in our production systems here within our import standards, then all we do is export our industry overseas,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says it ""will not lower food standards and will uphold high animal welfare standards as part of our approach to trade"". It adds that it will ""always consider whether overseas produce has an unfair advantage and any impact that may have"". The National Pig Association said it would be ""following the next steps closely"" on farrowing crates and was itself looking towards more flexible systems. The British Poultry Council have been approached by the BBC for comment. Meanwhile, the RSPCA said a puppy farm ban could be a ""real game-changer"" and that it would work with the government on writing the legislation to ""make sure there are no loopholes"". Puppy farming is a term used to describe the practice of keeping dogs in poor conditions where they produce multiple litters a year to maximise profits. Animal rights campaigners say the practice can lead to long-term health issues in puppies. It is not currently illegal to breed a large number of dogs. Breeders selling three or more litters a year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland must undergo an inspection to get a licence. The government says it will launch a consultation on introducing a new registration scheme for all dog breeders, and on improving the health and welfare standards required for licences. The government is also looking to ban the use of snare traps in the countryside and confirmed it would carry out a consultation on the proposed ban on trail hunting in 2026. Trail hunting involves using a rag with a natural scent on to lay a trail ahead of a hunt, which is then followed by the hounds - but live animal scents could be picked up by the pack instead. Reynolds told the BBC that while Labour had previously banned fox hunting in 2004 ""we have seen that people are trying to get around that ban by using trail hunting in some cases"". ""Obviously that's also a problem of enforcement, it's not just the legislation, but we are determined to go further, which is why banning trail hunting is in the animal welfare strategy,"" she said. ""We know sometimes it is used as a smokescreen for fox hunting."" But Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said it was ""unbelievable"" that the government would be spending more parliamentary time on hunting. He said: ""Revisiting this pointless and divisive issue is completely unnecessary. ""People across the countryside will be shocked that after Labour's attack on family farms and its neglect of rural communities it thinks banning trail hunting and snares used for fox control are a political priority."" Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake called the ban an ""attack on rural Britain and British culture"", accusing the government of ""punishing the law-abiding majority who support legal trail hunting"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93wxd27dvko
2025-10-21,"'It's harder to be a parent than a space shuttle commander', trailblazing Nasa pilot tells BBC",science,BBC,"She's the astronaut who smashed through the glass ceiling. And kept on going. Eileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a Nasa spacecraft - but despite her remarkable achievements, not everyone will know her name. Now a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that. We meet Collins at London's Science Museum. She's softly spoken, warm and very down to earth - but you quickly get a sense of her focus and determination. She clearly has inner steel. ""I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old, and I thought that's the coolest thing. That's what I want to do,"" she says. ""Of course, there were no women astronauts back then. But I just thought, I'll be a lady astronaut."" But that little girl set her sights even higher - she wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft. And the only way to achieve this was to join the military and become a test pilot. In the Air Force, she stood out from the crowd and was selected to join the astronaut programme. She was to fly Space Shuttles - Nasa's reusable ""space planes"". She knew the eyes of the world were on her when her first mission launched in 1995. ""As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn't want people to say, 'Oh look, the woman has made a mistake'. Because it wasn't just about me, it was about the women to follow me,"" she says. ""And I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was: 'Hey, they're really good'."" She was so good in fact that she was soon promoted to commander, in another first. Collins was also a parent to two young children. The fact that she was a working wife and mother was frequently brought up in press conferences at the time, with some journalists seemingly astonished that she could be both. But Collins says being a mum and a commander were ""the two best jobs in the world"". ""But I'm going to tell you it is harder to be a parent than to be a space shuttle commander,"" she laughs. ""The best training I ever had for being a commander was being a parent - because you have to learn how to say no to people."" Nasa's Space Shuttles, which flew for three decades, reached breathtaking highs, but also some terrible lows. In 1986, the Challenger spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure seconds after launching, killing all seven crew members on board. And in 2003, the Columbia shuttle broke up in the skies over Texas at the end of its mission, killing its crew of seven as well. A piece of insulating foam on Columbia's fuel tank broke loose during launch, damaging the heat shield with devastating results. Columbia was unable to withstand the fiery re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating as the world watched on in horror. Collins shakes her head at the memory of the disaster, and of the friends whose lives were lost. But with her job as commander, she had to pick up the mantle - she was to be in charge of the shuttle's following flight. Did she think about quitting at that point? ""People throughout the shuttle programme were counting on the commander to stick with it,"" she says quietly. ""I think quitting the mission would have been the opposite of brave… and I wanted to be a brave leader. I wanted to be a confident leader. I wanted to instill that confidence in other people."" But when her mission finally took to the skies in 2005, the nightmare scenario happened again. A chunk of foam broke away during launch. This time, though, there was a plan in place to check the damage. But it meant undertaking one of the riskiest maneuvers in space history. Collins had to pilot the shuttle through a 360 degree flip while flying beneath the International Space Station. It allowed colleagues on the orbiting lab to photograph the craft's underside and check if the heatshield had been breached. ""There were engineers and managers saying it couldn't be done, all these reasons why it was too dangerous,"" she says. ""I listened to the discussion, they knew I was the commander, and I said: 'It sounds like we can do it'."" With her hands steady at the controls, her voice calm as she spoke to mission control, Collins piloted the craft through a slow, graceful somersault. With the shuttle's underside now visible, the damage was quickly spotted - and a spacewalk was carried out to repair it. It meant Collins and her crew would make it safely home. This was Collins's last flight. She tells us that she always planned to stop after her fourth mission - to give others a chance to go to space. And she's watched plenty of astronauts follow in her footsteps. Does she have any advice for the next generation dreaming of the stars? ""Do your homework, listen to your teacher, pay attention in class and read books, and that will give you something to focus on,"" she says in a matter-of-fact way. Those who follow Collins to space will learn just how much she achieved, not only as a woman, but as a formidable pilot and commander. She says she has no regrets about bringing her astronaut career to an end. She made her decision and didn't look back. But there's still a wistful look in her eye when we ask if she'd be tempted if a seat on a spacecraft became free. ""Yes, I would love to go on a mission someday. When I'm an old lady, maybe I'll get a chance to go back in space.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxzdg203jo
2025-12-30,"Great white sharks face extinction in Mediterranean, say researchers",science,BBC,"Great white sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are in danger of disappearing, with illegal fishing contributing to their decline. This is according to research by US scientists, working in partnership with UK  charity . They say some of the most threatened species - including great white sharks - are being sold in North African fish markets. Great whites are one of more than 20 Mediterranean shark species , meaning it is illegal to fish for them or to sell them. By monitoring fishing ports on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, however, researchers discovered that at least 40 great white sharks have been killed there in 2025 alone. The BBC has also found, and independently verified, footage from social media of protected sharks being brought dead into North African ports. One video showed a large great white being hauled ashore from a fishing boat in Algeria. Another, filmed in Tunisia, shows heads and fins of what appears to be a short-finned mako shark, which is also a threatened and protected species, being prepared for sale. Lead researcher, Dr Francesco Ferretti from the US university Virginia Tech, explained that many shark populations -  white sharks in particular - had ""No other stretch of water is fished like the Mediterranean Sea,"" he said, speaking to  the BBC News science team while working on a research vessel off the coast of Sicily in late 2025. ""The impact of industrial fishing has been intensifying... and it's plausible that they will go extinct in the near future."" The Mediterranean white shark population is In their latest attempt to find and study the predators, Dr Ferretti and his team worked in the Strait of Sicily - an area between Sicily and North Africa that has been identified as a ""last stronghold"" in the Mediterranean for several threatened shark species. One key aim of their mission was to fit a satellite tracking tag onto a white shark - something that has never been done in the Mediterranean Sea. To attempt this, the researchers brought more than three tonnes of fish bait - a shipping container packed with frozen mackerel and tuna scraps, as well as 500 litres of tuna oil to create a ""fat slick"" that many sharks would be able to smell from hundreds of metres away. Despite working for two weeks - baiting the ocean, taking samples of seawater to search for shark DNA and using underwater cameras - the researchers did not manage to find any animals to tag. They captured only a brief glimpse of one blue shark on their submarine cameras. ""It's disheartening,"" Dr Ferretti told us. ""It just shows how degraded this ecosystem is."" While the team was searching for surviving sharks, they also received reports that a juvenile great white had been caught and killed in a North African fishery -  just 20 nautical miles from where they were working. It is not clear whether that animal was accidentally caught in fishing gear, or if it was targeted. Dr Ferretti and his team, though, estimate that more than 40 great white sharks have been caught around that coast. ""This is a lot for a critically endangered population,"" he said. The researchers, with their colleagues in North Africa are monitoring several fishing ports in the region. Our work, with the BBC Forensics team, also shows that protected sharks are caught, landed and offered for sale in countries including Tunisia and Algeria. We found footage - posted on social media - of a great white being landed in a fishing port in Algeria and another large shark that appears to be a protected short-finned mako, being prepared for sale on a trolly in a fish market in Tunisia. The rules that protect sharks are complicated. Currently, 24 threatened species have international legal protection – including mako, angel, threshers and hammerheads. The EU and 23 nations around the Mediterranean have signed , which states that those species cannot be ""retained on board, transhipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold or displayed or offered for sale"". The international agreement states ""they must be released unharmed and alive [where] possible"". Those rules do not tackle accidental bycatch and enforcement is variable from country to country. James Glancy from Blue Marine told BBC News that his own investigation found multiple white sharks on sale in Tunisian fishing markets. But, he said, there was a paradoxical element of hope in the fact that white sharks were turning up for sale. ""It shows that there is wildlife left,"" he told BBC News. ""And if we can preserve this, there is a chance of recovery."" In poorer communities in North Africa, fishers who catch sharks might face the choice of whether to feed their family, or return a threatened species to the ocean. Sara Almabruk from the Libyan Marine Biology Society says that most of the catches happening in North African waters are accidental, but adds: ""Why would they throw sharks back into the sea when they need food for their children? ""If you support them and train them in more sustainable fishing, they will not catch white sharks – or any sharks."" James Glancy from Blue Marine added that if countries around the Mediterranean worked together, ""there is hope. ""But, he added, ""we've got to act very quickly"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qe9wvq534o
2025-12-28,From grain to gigs: How corn exchanges are finding a new future,science,BBC,"The building, currently celebrating its 150th anniversary, is an established concert venue that has hosted David Bowie, Queen and The Who, but it once served a very different function. Other towns and cities in the region, including Ipswich, Bedford, Hertford and King's Lynn, also have corn exchanges hosting concerts, plays or cinema screenings. Northampton's Grade II-listed example, derelict for more than a decade, is due for similar treatment after it was Others have been converted into pubs, restaurants, offices and shops. But how and why did these halls come into being – and what does the future hold? Unsurprisingly, they were venues where cereal crops, including wheat, barley, oats and rye, were traded. They took off in the mid-18th Century, explains Prof Anthony Howe, an expert in Victorian Britain at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. Agriculture was improving and more corn was needed to feed a growing population. Previously, growers tended to sell their corn at a general market, he explains. ""Eventually they thought, 'Actually, it'd be much better if we had a structure that the farmers can bring the grain into'."" Early purpose-built exchanges included Bristol (1741-43), London (1747) and Liverpool (1749-54). They began to spread to smaller towns, particularly in grain-growing areas such as East Anglia. As farming became more commercialised, merchants got involved. Rather than carting all their wares to market, farmers would often take just a sample, allowing larger quantities to be traded. While some exchanges were built by local collectives of corn merchants, others were the work of speculative companies. The Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 created more town councils. ""They began to regard it as part of urban improvement to build a corn exchange, because it will bring business into the town,"" says Prof Howe. ""You want a nice-looking corn exchange to show that your town is better than the town next door. ""And when you're building a new one, you want it to be bigger and better... because you're going to attract more merchants to sell at your market."" The development of the railways, and the 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, which had kept domestic grain prices high, further boosted their development. ""The ones you see surviving nowadays really came in the mid-19th Century, and the bulk of them were built between the 1830s and the 1860s,"" says Prof Howe. ""I don't think many were built after the 1880s."" Exchanges tended to be large spaces, often with glass roofs and large windows to let in natural light and enable buyers to properly examine the corn. They were ""hugely economically important"", says Prof Howe, and many were architecturally impressive. They were lively places, where farmers and labourers mingled with merchants. The Great Depression of British Agriculture from 1873 to 1896, caused by the fall in grain prices following the opening up of the American prairies to cultivation and the advent of the steamship, led to the exchanges' decline. By the early 20th Century, some were being used as cinemas. Most had always been used for other purposes – such as public meetings, court hearings or theatre performances – since corn trading typically lasted only a couple of hours a week. Prof Howe names Diss Corn Hall in Norfolk as a particular favourite. Built in 1854, it is believed to have been one of the country's last functioning exchanges, operating until 1998. Run by a trust, it became an arts venue in 2010. A pre-fame Ed Sheeran played its gala opening. It underwent refurbishment in 2016-17 as part of a £3.4m programme to regenerate the historic town centre. ""It's a great space,"" says general manager Lee Johnson. ""From the front, it's a beautiful building, neo-classical in style – quite imposing – and behind, we have the new extension housing the box office, the gallery and a bar and cafe."" It has hosted 285 events over the past year. ""We are a very, very busy little corn hall,"" says Mr Johnson. ""It has a fantastic buzz about it. We're always looking at ways to attract new audiences and activities. ""We are very fortunate to have this building. I think it will be here for another 170 years. It's not going anywhere."" with a National Lottery-funded exhibition in February to share some of its heritage. Its opening in 1875 was marred by trouble when undergraduates rioted, prompting seven arrests. It was still used for corn trading until 1965 but also often hosted sales of other goods. In 1898, Rolls-Royce co-founder Charles Rolls took a test ride around the room on a motorcycle being displayed there. Suede, Lily Allen and Happy Mondays are among the acts due to play the venue in 2026. Rosie Amos, heritage project manager, says: ""As well as a concert venue, over the decades the Corn Exchange has become a hub for the Cambridge community. ""From hosting meetings for women's suffrage to distributing ration books in wartime, it has been what the community needed. Looking forward, it will continue to do the same."" Other towns have been less fortunate. Thomas Ollivier, of The Victorian Society, says some corn exchanges were demolished after World War Two and in the 1960s and 70s. Peterborough, Chelmsford, Norwich, Luton and Watford are among the places to have lost theirs. ""Victorian architecture was not wanted. The ones that have survived tend to be the better examples that could be adapted,"" says Mr Ollivier. He says the buildings are important, but not as valued as they should be. ""They are not exactly high up people's lists for renovation. There is not that immediate financial gain for developers."" However, he says they lend themselves well to reuse, including as arts venues. So, what of the future? Do these buildings have one? Sarah Gallagher, Conservative portfolio holder for customer experience, leisure and culture at Bedford Borough Council, describes the town's corn exchange as one of its ""most iconic and loved landmarks"" and ""a place where culture, creativity and community come together"". It will be closed during January ""By investing in the Corn Exchange, we are investing in Bedford's future: boosting footfall, supporting local businesses and showcasing our town as a vibrant destination to live, work and visit,"" she adds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd560ql1e0o
2025-08-05,Nasa to put nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 - US media,science,BBC,"US space agency Nasa will fast-track plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, according to US media. It is part of US ambitions to build a permanent base for humans to live on the lunar surface. According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries ""could potentially declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon. But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon's surface, with some planning permanent human settlements. ""To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,"" US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times. Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts. The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022 Nasa issued three $5m contracts to companies to design a reactor. And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035. Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface. One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging. ""Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,"" suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the university of Surrey ""Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,"" he adds. Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 ""given the commitment of enough money"", and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors. ""It's just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,"" he adds, referring to Nasa's Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon. There are also some questions around safety. ""Launching radioactive material through the Earth's atmosphere brings safety concerns. You have to have a special license to do that, but it is not insurmountable,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, planetary science specialist at the Open University. Mr Duffy's directive came as a surprise following recent turmoil in Nasa after Mr Trump's administration announced cuts of 24% to Nasa's budgets in 2026. That includes cuts to a significant number of science programmes such as the Mars Sample Return that aims to return samples from the planet's surface to Earth. Scientists are also concerned that this announcement is a politically-motivated move in the new international race to the Moon. ""It seems that we're going back into the old first space race days of competition, which, from a scientific perspective, is a little bit disappointing and concerning,"" says Dr Barber. ""Competition can create innovation, but if there's a narrower focus on national interest and on establishing ownership, then you can lose sight of the bigger picture which is exploring the solar system and beyond,"" he adds. Mr Duffy's comments about the potential for China and Russia to potentially ""declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon appear to be referring to an agreement called the Artemis accords. In 2020 seven nations signed the agreement to establish principles on how countries should co-operate on the Moon's surface. The accords include so-called safety zones to be established around operations and assets that countries build on the Moon. ""If you build a nuclear reactor or or any kind of base on the moon, you can then start claiming that you have a safety zone around it, because you have equipment there,"" says Dr Barber. ""To some people, this is tantamount to, 'we own this bit of the moon, we're going to operate here and and you can't come in',"" he explains. Dr Barber points out that there are hurdles to overcome before placing a nuclear reactor on the Moon for humans to use. Nasa's Artemis 3 aims to send humans to the lunar surface in 2027, but it has faced a series of set-backs and uncertainty around funding. ""If you've got nuclear power for a base, but you've got no way of getting people and equipment there, then it's not much use,"" he added. ""The plans don't appear very joined up at the moment,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev2dylxv74o
2025-09-10,Life on Mars? 'Leopard-spot' rocks could be biggest clue yet,science,BBC,"Unusual rocks discovered on Mars contain the most tantalising evidence yet of potential past life on the Red Planet. The mudstones, found in a dusty riverbed by Nasa's Perseverance Rover, are dotted with intriguing markings nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds. Scientists believe these features contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient Martian microbes. It's possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but at a press conference Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found. The findings are significant enough to meet Nasa's criteria for what it calls ""potential biosignatures"". This means that they warrant further investigation to determine whether they are biological in origin. ""We've not had something like this before, so I think that's the big deal,"" said Prof Sanjeev Gupta, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London and one of the authors of which has been published in the journal Nature. ""We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase."" ""It's like seeing a leftover fossil. Maybe it was a leftover meal, maybe that meal's been excreted and that's what we're seeing here,"" Dr Nicola Fox, Nasa's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, said in at the press conference. The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis . A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain.  The US Space Agency's science budget is facing huge cuts that have been put forward in President Trump's 2026 budget and a sample return mission is one of those facing cancellation. Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life. The Perseverance Rover, which touched down on the Martian surface in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology. It has spent the last four years exploring a region called the Jezero Crater, which was once an ancient lake with a river flowing into it. The rover found the leopard print rocks last year at the bottom of a canyon carved out by the river in an area called the Bright Angel Formation. They are about 3.5bn years old and are a type of rock called mudstone, which is fine-grained rock formed from clays. ""We kind of immediately knew there was some interesting chemistry that had happened in these rocks so we were pretty excited right away,"" said Joel Hurowitz from Stony Brook University in New York, who is also a Perseverance mission scientist and lead author of the paper. The rover used several instruments in its onboard lab to analyse the minerals in the rocks. This data was then beamed back to Earth for scientists to study. ""We think what we've found is evidence for a set of chemical reactions that took place in the mud that was deposited at the bottom of a lake - and those chemical reactions seem to have taken place between the mud itself and organic matter - and those two ingredients reacted to form new minerals,"" explained Dr Hurowitz. In similar conditions on Earth, chemical reactions creating minerals are typically driven by microbes. ""That is one of the possible explanations for how these features came to be in these rocks,"" said Dr Hurowitz. ""This feels like the most compelling potential biosignature detection that we've had to date."" The scientists have also examined how the minerals could have formed without microbes - and concluded that natural geological processes could also be behind the chemical reactions. However they would require high temperatures, and the rocks don't look like they've been heated. ""We found some difficulties for the non-biological pathways - but we can't rule them out completely,"" Dr Hurowitz said. Perseverance has been collecting samples while it's been exploring Mars - including the rocks found at the Bright Angel Formation.  They have been stored in canisters, and will be deposited on the surface of Mars awaiting a mission that could return them. Nasa's plans for such an endeavour hang in the balance because of the threatened budget cuts, but China is also pursuing a sample return mission that could launch in 2028. While the decision is debated, scientists are desperate to get their gloved hands on the rocks. ""We need to see these samples back on Earth,"" said Prof Gupta. ""I think for true confidence, most scientists would want to see and examine these rocks on Earth - this is one of our high priority samples to return.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd725pj0g9ro
2025-08-09,"Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 astronaut, dies aged 97",science,BBC,"Astronaut Jim Lovell, who guided the Apollo 13 mission safely back to Earth in 1970, has died aged 97. Nasa said he had ""turned a potential tragedy into a success"" after an attempt to land on the Moon was aborted because of an explosion onboard the spacecraft while it was hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth. Tens of millions watched on television as Lovell and two other astronauts splashed back down into the Pacific Ocean, a moment which has become one of the most iconic in the history of space travel. Lovell, who was also part of the Apollo 8 mission, was the first man to go to the Moon twice - but never actually landed. Acting Nasa head Sean Duffy said Lovell had helped the US space programme to ""forge a historic path"". In a statement, Lovell's family said: ""We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind."" Tom Hanks, who played Lovell in the 1995 movie , called the astronaut one of those people ""who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own"". Hanks said in a statement on Instagram that Lovell's many voyages ""were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive"". One Saturday, a 16-year-old hauled a heavy, three-foot tube into the middle of a large field in Wisconsin. He had persuaded his science teacher to help him make a makeshift rocket. Somehow, he had managed to get his hands on the ingredients for gunpowder - potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal. He pulled on a welder's helmet for protection. He packed it with powder, struck a match and ran like hell. The rocket rose 80 feet into the air and exploded. Had the chemicals been packed slightly differently, he would have been blown to pieces. For Jim Lovell, this was more than a childish lark. In achieving his dream to be a rocket scientist, he would become an American hero. But it was not going to be easy. James Arthur Lovell Jr was born on 25 March 1928 - just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic trip across the Atlantic. ""Boys like either dinosaurs or airplanes,"" he said. ""I was very much an airplane boy."" When he was five years old, his father died in a car accident. His mother, Blanche, worked all hours, struggling to keep food on the table. University was well beyond their financial reach. The answer was the US Navy, which was hungry for new pilots after World War Two. It was not building rockets but at least it involved flying. Lovell signed up to a programme that sent him to college at the military's expense while training as a fighter pilot. Two years in, he gambled and switched to the Navy Academy at Annapolis, on Chesapeake Bay, in the hope of working with his beloved rockets. A few months later, the Korean War broke out and his former fellow apprentice pilots were sent to South East Asia. Many never got to finish their education. Marriage was banned at Annapolis and girlfriends discouraged. The navy did not want its midshipmen wasting their time on such frivolities. But Lovell had a sweetheart. Marilyn Gerlach was the high school girl he had shyly asked to the prom. Women were not allowed on campus and trips outside were limited to 45 minutes. Somehow the relationship survived. Just hours after his graduation in 1952, the newly commissioned Ensign Lovell married her. They would be together for more than 70 years, until Marilyn's death in 2023. He did everything he could to advertise his love of rocketry. His thesis at the Navy Academy was in the unheard-of topic of liquid-fuel engines. After graduation, he hoped to specialise in this pioneering new technology. Lovell was assigned to an aircraft carrier group flying Banshee jets off ships at night. It was a white-knuckle, high-wire business fit only for daredevils. But for Lovell, it was not enough. Project Mercury was America's attempt to place a man in orbit around the Earth. Jim Lovell was one of the 110 test pilots considered for selection but a temporary liver condition put paid to his chances. Four years later, he tried again. In June 1962, after gruelling medical tests, Nasa announced its ""New Nine"". These would be the men to deliver on President Kennedy's pledge to put American boots on the Moon. It was the most elite group of flying men ever assembled. They included Neil Armstrong, John Young and, fulfilling his childhood dream, Jim Lovell. Three years later he was ready. His first trip into space was aboard the two-man Gemini 7. Lovell and fellow astronaut Frank Borman ate a steak-and-eggs breakfast and blasted off. Their mission: to find out if men could survive two weeks in space. If not, the Moon was out of reach. With the endurance record complete, Lovell's next flight was in command of Gemini 12 alongside space rookie Buzz Aldrin. This time they proved that man could work outside a spacecraft. Aldrin clambered awkwardly into the void, spending five hours photographing star fields. The crew of Apollo 8 would be the first to travel beyond low Earth orbit and enter the gravitational pull of another celestial body. It was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet. The Saturn V rocket that shot Lovell, Borman and William Anders out of our atmosphere at 25,000mph (40,233km/h) was huge - three times larger than anything seen on the Gemini programme. As navigator, Lovell took with him a sextant to take star readings - in case the computers failed and they had to find their own way home. Sixty-eight hours after take-off, they made it. The engines fired and Apollo 8 slid silently behind the Moon. The men heard a crackle in their headsets as the radio signal to Mission Control faltered and then failed. The spellbound astronauts pinned themselves to the windows, the first humans to see the far side of our nearest celestial neighbour. And then, from over the advancing horizon, an incredible sight. ""Get the camera, quick,"" said Lovell. America was mired in Vietnam abroad and civil unrest at home. But at that moment, it seemed that humanity was united. The people of the world saw their planet as the astronauts saw it - fragile and beautiful, shining in the desolation of space. Lovell read from the Book of Genesis, the basis of many of the world's great religions, to the people of the Earth. ""And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."" For him, it was an image that changed our world forever. He put his thumb against the window and the whole world disappeared behind it. It was the most moving experience of his life. As the spacecraft re-emerged from the darkness, Lovell was first to announce the good news. ""Please be advised,"" he said as the radio crackled back into life, ""there is a Santa Claus."" At that very moment, 239,000 miles away, a man in a blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside Lovell's house in Houston. He walked past the dozens of reporters camped outside and handed a box to Marilyn. She opened the star-patterned tissue paper and pulled out a mink jacket. ""Happy Christmas,"" said the card that came with it, ""and love from the Man in the Moon."" They went up as astronauts and came down celebrities. The people of the Earth had followed their every move on TV. There were ticker tape parades, congressional honours and a place on the cover of Time Magazine. And they had not even set foot on the Moon. That honour went, of course, to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. A year later, Kennedy's dream was posthumously seen to fruition. A small step was taken and mankind took its giant leap. The New Nine had done their job. In April 1970, it was Jim Lovell's turn. Fortunately, the crew of Apollo 13 did not believe in unlucky numbers. Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise were men of science - highly trained and determined to follow Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar surface. But things went badly wrong. They were 200,000 miles above the Earth and closing in on their target when they needed to stir tanks containing vital oxygen and hydrogen. Swigert flicked the switch. It should have been a routine procedure but the command module, Odyssey, shuddered. Oxygen pressure fell and power shut down. ""I believe we've had a problem here,"" said Swigert. Lovell had to repeat the message to a stunned Mission Control: ""Houston, we've had a problem."" It was one of the greatest understatements of all time. The crew were in big trouble - a dramatic explosion had disabled their craft. Haise and Lovell worked frantically to boot up the lunar module, Aquarius. It was not supposed to be used until they got to the Moon. It had no heat shield, so could not be used to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. But it could keep them alive until they got there. The world stopped breathing and watched. For a second time, Jim Lovell had brought the world together as one. The first time it had been for Earthrise, the second would be to witness his fight to survive. “For four days,"" said Marilyn, ""I didn’t know if I was a wife or a widow."" Temperatures fell to freezing, food and water were rationed. It was days before they limped back to the fringes of Earth's atmosphere. They climbed back aboard the Odyssey and prayed the heat shield had not been damaged. The radio silence that accompanies re-entry went on far longer than normal. Millions watched on TV, many convinced that all was lost. After six agonising minutes, Jack Swigert's voice cut through the silence. The team on the ground held its breath until the parachutes deployed and the crew was safely down. The mission was Nasa's greatest failure and, without question, its finest hour. Lovell retired from the navy in 1973 and opted for a the quiet life, working for the Bay-Houston Towing Company, giving speeches and serving as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. His book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, became the famous 1995 movie, starring Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell. For the film, the director asked him to dress up as an admiral. It was for a cameo scene, shaking hands with Hanks when the crew were rescued from the sea. But the old American hero was not having it. Jim Lovell had been to the Moon twice, witnessed Earthrise and narrowly avoided a cold death in space - and saw no reason to falsely burnish his He took out his old navy uniform, dusted it down and put it on for the cameo appearance. ""I retired as a captain,"" he insisted, ""and a captain I will be.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl7y8zq5xpno
2025-12-28,Why are councils voting for 'rights' of rivers?,science,BBC,"The right to flow, the right to native biodiversity, the right to be free from pollution. These are some of the rights that a small but growing number of local authorities in the south-east of England have decided their area's rivers should have. The lawyers, campaigners and councillors behind the ""rights of rivers"" declarations accept it is up to Parliament to give England's waterways the same legal status as people. But they claim they are building a growing movement to improve the condition of the country's rivers. Backed by campaign group Love Our Ouse and other organisations, Lewes District Council became the first authority in East Sussex to declare rights of rivers in February, two years after first agreeing it would work towards doing so. Emma Montlake, a director at Love Our Ouse, said it was ""very much a community-led process"". The Environmental Law Foundation lawyer said the district's town and parish councils were also ""endorsing and supporting the charter, so it feels very grassroots"". Wealden District Council voted in favour of a similar declaration to Lewes in July. Rother District Council, which like Lewes and Wealden is coalition-run, voted in September to support the rights of rivers. It passed a motion backing rights for heritage trees at the same meeting and declared a ""nature emergency"" in December. In Hampshire, Conservative Party-run Test Valley Borough Council and Labour-majority Southampton City Council East Hampshire District Council recognised the rights of rivers in November. ""It felt like there was a movement to try and change the relationship between human beings and nature,"" Rother councillor Nicola McLaren said, ""so we thought it was a great opportunity to be part of that movement."" The Liberal Democrat, who proposed the motions alongside Green councillor Sue Burton, says the rivers declaration helps the council review policies such as its local plan, which influences planning decisions, and its climate strategy action plan. The charter gives ""not just moral support"" to local environment groups but also practical support, she told the BBC, as it ""lends power to their work"". McLaren said: ""We're trying to behave as if the rivers do have these rights so that we can use that thinking and that framework to underpin our decision making."" Emily Julier, a counsel knowledge lawyer at Hogan Lovells, who has helped draft rights of rivers motions, said councillors ""should have a mind to [the motions] in council decision making, because they've all agreed to it"". ""Rights of rivers is quite a unifying topic, and it's also been something which has been unifying across the political divide,"" she told the BBC. In Kent, Maidstone Borough Council leader Stuart Jeffery says the council is ""working on a range of measures to embed the rights of nature into our policies and practices"". The authority supported a nine-day ""source to sea pilgrimage"" of the River Medway organised by campaigners in July. Zofia Page, campaigner with Friends of the River Medway, said the event was a space ""for councils to come together to actually discuss it"". by conservation charity The Rivers Trust, none of England's rivers were in good overall health. The government says it is ""taking decisive action to clean up England's rivers, lakes, and seas"", but it does not have plans to enshrine rivers as living entities with rights. This step has been taken elsewhere. Most famously New Zealand Paul Powlesland, co-founder of Lawyers for Nature, says national legislation in England ""feels like a long way away"". ""If the national change never happens then there is still crucial work happening locally on rivers,"" he told the BBC. ""These motions are everything and nothing,"" he said. ""If you don't act upon them and go out there and make those rights a reality, they're meaningless. ""But if you do do that, they are utterly transformative in how humans in our society relate to rivers."" Medway campaigner Ms Page said it would be ""a successful campaign if we've got around 75% of councils in the UK having passed this as a motion"" within a year. ""Obviously it's a hugely ambitious number,"" she said, but ""if there's a snowball effect with this it could lead to that, definitely"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2glkq1qgro
2025-12-16,EU waters down plans to end new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035,science,BBC,"The European Commission has watered down its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. Current rules state that new vehicles sold from that date should be ""zero emission"", but carmakers, particularly in Germany, have lobbied heavily for concessions. Under the European Commission's new plan, 90% of new cars sold from 2035 would have to be zero-emission, rather than 100%. According to the European carmakers association, ACEA, market demand for electric cars is currently too low, and without a change to the rules, manufacturers would risk ""multi-billion euro"" penalties. The remaining 10% could be made up of conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids. Carmakers will be expected to use low-carbon steel made in the EU in the vehicles they produce. The Commission also expects an increase in the use of biofuels and so-called e-fuels, which are synthesised from captured carbon dioxide, to compensate for the extra emissions created by petrol and diesel vehicles. Opponents of the move have warned that it risks undermining the transition towards electric vehicles and leaving the EU exposed in the face of foreign competition. The green transport group T&E has warned that the UK should not follow the EU's lead by weakening its own plans to phase out the sale of conventional cars under the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate. ""The UK must stand firm. Our ZEV mandate is already driving jobs, investment and innovation into the UK. As major exporters we cannot compete unless we innovate, and global markets are going electric fast,"" said T&E UK's director Anna Krajinska. Ahead of the announcement, Sigrid de Vries, director general at ACEA, said that ""flexibility"" for manufacturers was ""urgent"". ""2030 is around the corner, and market demand is too low to avoid the risk of multi-billion-euro penalties for manufacturers,"" she said. ""It will take time to build the charging points and introduce fiscal and purchase incentives to get the market on track. Policy makers must provide breathing space to manufacturers to sustain jobs, innovation and investments."" to encourage drivers to buy electric ahead of the government's planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030. Firms across the world have been changing their production lines and investing billions as governments try to persuade people to drive greener cars to meet environmental targets. Volvo said it had ""built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years"" and was prepared to go fully electric, using hybrids as a transition. It argued if it can move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, other companies should be able to as well. The carmaker said: ""Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come. ""A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength."" However, German carmaker Volkswagen welcomed the European Commission's draft proposal on new CO₂ targets, calling it ""economically sound overall"". It said: ""The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive. It is extremely important that the CO₂ targets for 2030 are made more flexible for passenger cars and adjusted for light commercial vehicles. ""Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions."" Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank, said the UK having ""stable policy"" would give companies the confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid ""jeopardising investments"". ""It was government policy that saw Sunderland chosen to build Nissan's original electric Leaf, and has started rolling off the production lines in the North East, securing jobs for years to come,"" he said. Octopus Electric Vehicles chief executive Fiona Howarth warned that if the UK reduced its goals because of changes in Brussels, it would send a ""damaging signal to investors, manufacturers and supply-chain partners"". Many of these groups have already invested heavily in the transition ""on the assumption the UK would stay the course,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk78y7k8ezo
2025-11-22,UN climate talks fail to secure new fossil fuel promises,science,BBC,"Following bitter rows, the UN climate summit COP30 in Belém, Brazil has ended with a deal that contains no direct reference to the fossil fuels that are heating up the planet. It is a frustrating end for more than 80 countries including the UK and EU that wanted the meeting to commit the world to stop using using oil, coal and gas at a faster pace. But oil-producing nations held the line that they should be allowed to use their fossil fuel resources to grow their economies. The meeting takes place as the UN says it fears global efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels have failed. A representative for Colombia furiously criticised the COP presidency for not allowing countries to object to the deal in the final meeting on Saturday, known as a plenary. ""Colombia believes that we have sufficient scientific evidence saying that more than 75% of the global greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels,"" Daniela Durán González, Colombian Climate Delegate, told BBC News. ""So we do believe it's time that the Convention on Climate Change starts talking about that reality,"" she added. The final deal, called the Mutirão, calls on countries to ""voluntarily"" accelerate their  action to reduce their use of fossil fuels. For the first time, the US did not send a delegation after President Donald Trump said the country will leave the landmark Paris treaty that committed countries to act on climate change in 2015. He has branded climate change ""a con"". Veteran negotiator and former Germany climate envoy Jennifer Morgan told the BBC that the US absence was a ""hole"" in the negotiations. Often the US has supported blocs like the EU and UK. ""In a 12-hour negotiation overnight, when you have oil-producing countries pushing back hard, to not have someone counteracting on that, it certainly was hard,"" she said But for many countries, the fact that the talks did not collapse or roll back on past climate agreements is a relief. Antigua and Barbuda Climate Ambassador Ruleta Thomas commented: ""We are happy that there is a process that continues to function [...] where every country can be heard."" In the final meeting, a representative for Saudi Arabia said: ""Each state must be allowed to build its own path, based on its respective circumstances and economies."" Like many other leading oil-producing nations, the country has argued it should be allowed to exploit its fossil fuel reserves as others have done in the past. The two weeks of talks were at times chaotic. Toilets ran out of water, torrential thunderstorms flooded the venue, and delegates struggled to cope in hot, humid rooms. The COP's around 50,000 registered delegates were evacuated twice. A group of about 150 protestors broke into the venue, breaching security lines, and carrying placards reading ""our forests are not for sale"". scorching a hole into the roof and forcing participants to rush outside. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva chose the city of Belém to put the world's attention on the Amazon rainforest and to bring a rush of finance to the city. Despite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil was criticised for its own plans to drill for oil at the mouth of the Amazon. Its offshore oil and gas production is on course to increase until the early 2030s, according to analysis shared with the BBC by campaign group Global Witness. Countries at the talks have competing interests, depending on their national circumstances and how exposed they are to the effects of climate change. Some countries were happy about the outcomes. India praised the deal, calling it ""meaningful"". A group representing the interests of 39 small island and low-lying coastal states on Saturday called it ""imperfect"" but still a step towards ""progress"". Poorer nations have come away with a promise for more climate finance to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. ""It has moved the needle. There is a clearer recognition that those with historic responsibility [countries that emitted more planet-warming gases in the past] have specific duties on climate finance,"" said Sierra Leone Minister of The Environment and Climate Change Jiwoh Abdulai. But it's a sour end for more than 80 countries, who negotiated through the night to keep stronger fossil fuel language in the deal. UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband insisted the meeting is a ""step forward"". ""I would have preferred a more ambitious agreement,"" he said. ""We're not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything,"" EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told journalists. With lush trees, bird cries and intense humidity, it was hard to escape the Amazonian backdrop of the talks. Brazil launched the talks with a new fund called Tropical Forests Forever Facility that would pay countries to protect tropical forests. By the end of the meeting, it raised at least $6.5bn from governments, although the UK has not yet contributed. Over 90 countries supported a call for a global deforestation action plan, or ""roadmap"". to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

2025-12-28,'My alligator is placid - except at dinnertime',science,BBC,"""When we got him he was 18 inches long,"" says Pam Mansfield, 75. ""George is now 7ft. He is pretty placid - except at dinnertime when you have to be so careful because he jumps up."" Mrs Mansfield is referring to the alligator basking in a heated enclosure, next to a pond, which is flanked by what appear to be mangroves. But she is not in the Florida Everglades. Rather, the cooler climes of rural Lincolnshire. George's favourite meal is six whole trout, I'm told. But he also has a penchant for deer, beef and the occasional chicken. Mrs Mansfield tells me how, in 2002, she and her late husband Mel received a call from a couple whose son had been involved in a serious road accident. ""We were told he had a number of lizards in his bathroom,"" she recalls. ""But we weren't told anything about the blimming alligator!"" Like George, Mrs Mansfield also has a remarkable backstory going back decades. Her love for animals began in childhood, I discover. ""My grandfather was a farmer,"" she says. ""There were always lots of animals about the place. Mrs Mansfield's voice softens. Mr Mansfield died in 2004. Today, she co-owns the refuge with their son Darren, who tends to the more needy - and dangerous - residents, such as George. ""My husband was a big animal lover too,"" she says, with joy returning to her voice. ""Well, put us together and it wasn't the best combination really!"" The couple were living in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when they started taking in injured birds and other small creatures. It quickly grew - and so did the size of the animals they began nursing back to health. ""After a while we moved to a village called Etton, and then, 29 years ago, we moved to our current home in Deeping St James in Lincolnshire. The house is literally in the middle of all the animals."" Mrs Mansfield tells how, in the early days, she had worked as a cleaner in a local pub, while her husband was an engineer. ""His wage would go on keeping us,"" she says. ""Mine would all go on the animals. Often, at 10 o'clock at night, Mel and I would be in the garden putting up a new enclosure. ""We didn't have holidays - we couldn't leave the animals."" Currently, the refuge is home to more than 500 animals including about 200 fish. Mrs Mansfield says: ""We used to get animals come to us from zoos and councils all over the country, but these days the animals tend to come from the public. ""We've got all sorts - monkeys, tegus, snakes, tortoises, caiman you name it. We're overrun with lizards at the moment."" The animals cannot be rehomed, explains Mrs Mansfield, with many requiring licences to keep them under the auspices of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act. Usually, animals have been given up because owners failed to do their homework, says Mrs Mansfield. ""People really need to know what they are letting themselves in for before buying an exotic pet. Come and speak to people like us, or staff at zoos - find out what it entails."" Life for Mrs Mansfield remains hectic, although she is assisted now by her son, who also lives on the site with his wife and their two children. The pair also employ a manager and have a team of 30 volunteers. Mrs Mansfield says: ""Unfortunately, my legs have gone and I can't do as much as I used to but I still do a fair bit."" When some of the rarer creatures require a health check or treatment, it is not a case of taking them along to the local vet. ""The vets often end up having to ring London Zoo for advice,"" she says. Running the refuge is not cheap, either - especially when creatures like George need energy-guzzling heat lamps. ""Our electricity bills are going up and up,"" says Mrs Mansfield. ""Our electricity bill is about £3,000 per month. This time a year ago, we were paying about £2,300 per month."" The monthly food bill alone is about £5,000 a month. ""A lot of the food is frozen,"" says Mrs Mansfield. ""Some comes straight from the slaughterhouse."" The increase in food banks, fuelled by the recent cost of living crisis, has caused additional pressures. ""The food we used to get free from supermarkets is now donated to food banks,"" says Mrs Mansfield. ""We tend to get what's left, but we also have to buy a fair amount of food."" To make ends meet, Exotic Pet Refuge holds several open days throughout the year, requesting a small fee from visitors. ""We also rely a lot on legacies,"" says Mrs Mansfield. She has no intention of stopping. ""I love animals,"" she says. ""Looking after them is all I have ever known. I can't stand the thought of them suffering."" Returning to George, who has his own spacious enclosure, Mrs Mansfield - though always cautious around him - clearly has a soft spot for the reptile. ""George's name was chosen by a group of schoolchildren,"" she says. ""He is a big old boy. But he is a good boy. He's certainly popular!""

2025-11-17,Brazil's Amazon rainforest at risk as key protection under threat,science,BBC,"The Amazon rainforest could face a renewed surge of deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a long-standing ban that has protected it. The ban - which prohibits the sale of soya grown on land cleared after 2008 - is widely credited with curbing deforestation and has been held up as a global environmental success story. But powerful farming interests in Brazil, backed by a group of Brazilian politicians, are pushing to lift the restrictions as the COP30 UN climate conference enters its second week. Critics of the ban say it is an unfair ""cartel"" which allows a small group of powerful companies to dominate the Amazon's soya trade. Environmental groups have warned removing the ban would be ""disaster"", opening the way for a new wave of land grabbing to plant more soya in the world's largest rainforest. Scientists say ongoing deforestation, combined with the effects of climate change, is already driving the Amazon towards a potential ""tipping point"" – a threshold beyond which the rainforest can no longer sustain itself. Brazil is the world's largest producer of soya beans, a staple crop grown for its protein and an important animal feed. Much of the meat consumed in the UK – including chicken, beef, pork and farmed fish - is raised using feeds that include soya beans, about 10% of which are sourced from the Brazilian Amazon. Many major UK food companies, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, M&S, Aldi, Lidl, McDonald's, Greggs and KFC, are members of a coalition called which represents around 60% of the soy imported into the UK. The group supports the ban, which is known officially as the Amazon Soy Moratorium, because they argue it helps ensure UK soy supply chains remain free from deforestation. the signatories said: ""We urge all actors within the soy supply chain, including governments, financial institutions and agribusinesses to reinforce their commitment to the [ban] and ensure its continuation."" Public opinion in the UK also appears to be firmly behind protecting the Amazon. conducted earlier this year found that 70% of respondents supported government action to eliminate illegal deforestation from UK supply chains. But Brazilian opponents of the agreement last week into whether the moratorium amounts to anti-competitive behaviour. ""Our state has lots of room to grow and the soy moratorium is working against this development,"" Vanderlei Ataídes told the BBC.  He is president of the Soya Farmers Association of Pará state, one of Brazil's main soya producing areas. ""I don't understand how [the ban] helps the environment,"" he added.  ""I can't plant soya beans, but I can use the same land to plant corn, rice, cotton or other crops.  Why can't I plant soya?"" The challenge has even divided the Brazilian government. While the Justice Ministry says there may be evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, both the Ministry of the Environment and the Federal Public Prosecutors Office have publicly defended the moratorium. The voluntary agreement was first signed almost two decades ago by farmers, environmental organisations and major global food companies, including commodities giants such as Cargill and Bunge. It followed a campaign by the environmental pressure group Greenpeace that exposed how soya grown on deforested land was being used in animal feed, including for chicken sold by McDonald's. The fast-food chain became a champion of the moratorium, whose signatories pledged not to buy soya grown on land deforested after 2008. Before the moratorium, forest clearance for soya expansion and the growth of cattle ranching were the main drivers of Amazonian deforestation. After the agreement was introduced forest clearance fell sharply, reaching an historic low in 2012 during President Lula's second term in office. Deforestation increased under subsequent administrations – notably under Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted opening the forest to economic development - but has fallen again during Lula's current presidency. Bel Lyon, chief advisor for Latin America at the World Wildlife Fund - one of the agreement's original signatories – warned that suspending the moratorium ""would be a disaster for the Amazon, its people, and the world, because it could open up an area the size of Portugal to deforestation"". Small farmers whose plots are close to soy plantations say they disrupt local weather patterns and make it harder to grow their crops. Raimundo Barbosa, who farms cassava and fruit near the town of Boa Esperança outside Santarém in the southeastern Amazon, says when the forest is cleared ""the environment is destroyed"". ""Where there is forest, it is normal, but when it is gone it just gets hotter and hotter and there is less rain and less water in the rivers,"" he told me as we sat in the shade beside the machines he uses to turn his cassava into flour. The pressure to lift the moratorium comes as Brazil prepares to open a major new railway stretching from its agricultural heartland in the south up into the rainforest. The railway is expected to significantly cut transport costs for soya and other agricultural products, adding yet another incentive to clear more land. Scientists say deforestation is already reshaping the rainforest in profound ways. Among them is Amazon specialist Bruce Fosberg, who has spent half a century studying the forest. He climbs 15 stories up a narrow tower that rises 45 metres above a pristine rainforest reserve in the heart of the Amazon. From a small platform at the top, he looks out over a sea of green stretching to the horizon. The tower is bristling with high-tech instruments - sensors that track almost everything happening between the forest and the atmosphere: water vapor, carbon dioxide, sunlight, and essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The tower was built 27 years ago and is part of a project - the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) - that aims to understand how the Amazon is changing, and how close it is to a critical threshold. Data from the LBA together with other scientific studies show parts of the rainforest may be nearing a ""tipping point"", after which the ecosystem can no longer maintain its own functions. ""The living forest is closing down,"" he says, ""and not producing water vapour and therefore rainfall"". As trees are lost to deforestation, fire, and heat stress, the forest releases less moisture into the atmosphere, he explains, reducing rainfall and intensifying drought. That, in turn, creates a feedback loop that kills even more trees. The fear is that, if this continues, vast areas of rainforest could die away and become a savannah or dry grassland ecosystem. Such a collapse would release huge amounts of carbon, disrupt weather patterns across continents, and threaten the millions of people – as well as the countless plant, insect and animal species – whose lives depend on the Amazon for survival. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

2025-12-19,Drones detect deadly virus in Arctic whales' breath,science,BBC,"Whale breath collected by drones is giving clues to the health of wild humpbacks and other whales. Scientists flew drones equipped with special kit through the exhaled droplets, or ""blows"", made when the giants come up to breathe through their blowholes. They detected a highly infectious virus linked to mass strandings of whales and dolphins worldwide. The sampling of whale ""blow"" is a ""game-changer"" for the health and well-being of whales, said Prof Terry Dawson of King's College London. ""It allows us to monitor pathogens in live whales without stress or harm, providing critical insights into diseases in rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems,"" he said. The researchers used drones carrying sterile petri dishes to capture droplets from the exhaled breath of humpback, fin and sperm whales, combined with skin biopsies taken from boats. They confirmed for the first time that a potentially deadly whale virus, known as cetacean morbillivirus, is circulating above the Arctic Circle. The disease is highly contagious and spreads easily among dolphins, whales, and porpoises causing severe disease and mass deaths. It can jump between species and travel across oceans, posing a significant threat to marine mammals. The researchers hope this breakthrough will help spot deadly threats to ocean life early, before they start to spread. ""Going forward, the priority is to continue using these methods for long-term surveillance, so we can understand how multiple emerging stressors will shape whale health in the coming years,"" said Helena Costa of Nord University, Norway.

2025-08-08,Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men,science,BBC,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. , means there are now just five people remaining who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space. More than 50 years since a human last set foot on the Moon, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is heating up once again. Nasa hopes its Artemis programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030, having on the far side of the Moon in June 2024. A number of private companies have tried to send scientific craft to the Moon, although the Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17 in 1972, last year but , as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Meanwhile, companies such as SpaceX and Boeing continue to develop their own technology, although not without their setbacks. which left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station were embarrassing for the aerospace giant, while the have become a customary sight to space watchers. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. Along with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, Jim Lovell made history when the three undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. But what of the remaining five Moon men? Who are they, and what are their stories? On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time.. There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott, the commander of Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon.

2025-11-10,"COP30: Trump and many leaders are skipping it, so does the summit still have a point?",science,BBC,"In it, dozens of men and women line up in dark suits, in front of an enormous sign that reads COP21 Paris. Right in the middle the UK's then-Prime Minister, David Cameron, grins widely, as he stands beside the future King Charles III, just in front of China’s Xi Jinping. Far off to the right is the then US President Barack Obama, deep in conversation with someone who is cut off from the frame - because there were so many leaders lining up that day that it was difficult for the photographer to capture them all at once. What a far cry from the family photograph taken on Thursday with this year's line-up at the COP30 summit in Brazil. Xi and Modi were no-shows, along with the leaders of around 160 other countries. And notably absent was the US President Donald Trump. In fact, the Trump administration has exited the process entirely and has said it will not send any high-level officials this year. Which raises the question, why have a two-week-long multinational gathering at all if so many leaders aren’t there? Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN's climate process under whose leadership the Paris Agreement was struck, said during last year's gathering that the COP process was ""not fit for purpose."" ""The golden era for multilateral diplomacy is over,"" agrees Joss Garman, a former climate activist who now heads a new think tank called Loom. ""Climate politics is now more than ever about who captures and controls the economic benefits of new energy industries,"" he tells me. So, with carbon dioxide emissions still rising even after 29 of these meetings - which are, after all, aimed at bringing them down - will more COPs make any difference? On his first day back in office, Trump used his trademark marker pen to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 UN treaty under which nations agreed to work together to try to keep global warming below 1.5°C. ""This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,"" he told the UN General Assembly in September. ""If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail."" He has rolled back restrictions on oil, gas, and coal, signed billions of dollars of tax breaks for fossil fuel firms, and opened up federal lands for extraction. Plus Trump and his team have called on governments around the world to abandon their ""pathetic"" renewable energy programmes and buy US oil and gas - in some cases with the risk of punitive tariffs if they don't. Japan and South Korea as well as Europe have agreed to buy tens of billions of US hydrocarbons. The objective is clear: Trump says he wants to make the US the ""number one energy superpower in the world"". Meanwhile, he has set about dismantling his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy agenda. Subsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar have been slashed, permits withdrawn, projects cancelled. Research funding has been cut too. ""Wind power in the United States has been subsidised for 33 years - isn't that enough?"" US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when I asked him to explain the administration's policy when we met in September. ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies."" John Podesta, a senior adviser on climate to both Obama and Biden, sees it differently. ""The United States is taking a wrecking ball to clean energy,"" he argues. “They're trying to take us back not to the 20th Century, but the 19th."" Last month, a landmark deal that would have cut global shipping emissions was abandoned after the US, along with Saudi Arabia, succeeded in ending the talks. Many supporters of the COP talks are concerned. What happens if the US path leads to other countries dialling down their commitments? Anna Aberg, a Research Fellow in Chatham House's Environment and Society Centre, describes COP as ""taking place in a really difficult political context"" given Trump's position. ""I think it's more important than ever that this COP sends some kind of signal to the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that are acting on climate change.” Trump's strategy puts the US on a collision course with China, which has also been working for decades to dominate the world's energy supplies - but through clean technology. In 2023, clean technologies drove roughly 40% of China's economic growth, according to the climate website Carbon Brief.  After a slight slowdown last year, renewables accounted for a quarter of all new growth and now make up more than 10% of the entire economy. And, like Trump's America, China is engaging internationally well beyond participation in COP - it is taking its entire energy model global. The split has transformed the climate debate. It is now one that pits the world's two superpowers against each other for control of the most essential industry on Earth. And it leaves the UK and Europe - as well as major emerging powers like India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil - caught in the middle. Speaking at this year‘s conference, a source in government at a major developed country said: “Of all the things they're most terrified of, the biggest is being seen to criticise Trump.” The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned last month that Europe must not repeat what she termed the mistakes of the past and lose another strategic industry to China. She called the loss of Europe's solar manufacturing base to cheaper Chinese rivals ""a cautionary tale we must not forget"". The European Commission has forecasted that the market for renewables and other clean energy sources will grow from €600bn (£528bn) to €2 trillion (£1.74tn) within a decade and wants Europe to capture at least 15% of that. But that ambition may come too late. ""China is already the world's clean-tech superpower,"" says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Policy Institute. Its dominance in solar, wind, EVs, and advanced battery technologies, he says, is now ""virtually unassailable”. He likens it to trying to beat the Chinese national team at table tennis: ""If you want to surpass China, you had to get your act together 25 years ago. If you want to do it now, you have no hope."" China produces over 80% of the world's solar panels, a similar share of advanced batteries, 70% of EVs, and more than 60% of wind turbines - all at phenomenally low prices. The EU's recent move to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs reflects the scale of the dilemma. Open the market and Europe's car industry could collapse; close it and green targets may not be met. Restricting Chinese access to these markets may slow emissions reductions, says Joss Garman, but he argues, ""If we ignore questions about economic security, jobs, national security, that risks undermining public and political support for the entire climate effort."" Now, with these shifts in direction of global politics and priorities, Anna Aberg says she expects COP to become an annual forum for ""holding to account"" countries and other organisations, something she believes remains an ""important role”. The gathering in Brazil follows the acknowledgement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the 1.5°C target set in Paris will be breached - this, he has said, represents ""deadly negligence"" on the part of the world community. Last year was the hottest ever recorded, and 60 leading climate scientists said in June that the Earth could breach 1.5°C in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet more people are questioning the need for an annual gathering. ""I think we need one big COP every five years. And between that, I'm not sure what COP is for,"" says Michael Liebreich, founder of energy consultancy Bloomberg New Energy Finance and host of a green energy podcast, Cleaning Up. ""You can't just expect politicians to go and make more and more commitments. You need time for industries to develop and for things to happen. You need the real economy to catch up."" He believes it would be much more productive for the discussions to happen in smaller meetings focused on removing barriers to clean energy. But he also believes that some issues, like implementation, need to be discussed in places he deems more relevant - like on Wall Street ""where people can actually fund stuff” - as opposed to on the edge of the Brazilian rainforest. Even so, this will be important negotiations at this year's COP. Among other things, it aims to get an agreement for a multi-billion-dollar fund to support the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin. Michael Jacobs, who advised Gordon Brown on climate policy and is now a politics professor at Sheffield University, believes that continued collective support for the process is crucial. ""It's a big political message, because Donald Trump is trying to undermine the collective process, but it's also a message to businesses that they should continue to invest in decarbonisation because governments will continue to enact climate policies."" The UK's Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband believes these meetings have delivered real progress by getting countries to engage with tackling climate change and enact policies that have made the renewable revolution possible. ""It's dry, it's complicated, it's anguished, it's tiring,” he says - “and it's absolutely necessary”. Many now do, however, accept there is a strong argument for these international gatherings to be scaled down. Ultimately, however, the real choice underlying it, for so many nations in attendance, simply comes down to the extent to which they align with a China-led clean energy revolution - or double down on the fossil fuels–first agenda. Which is why many observers say the process of decarbonisation is going to be less about the multi-country commitments of COPs past, and far more about big-money deals between individual countries as we look ahead to this year’s summit - and how COPs may well play out in the future.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205jvyg3wjo
2025-12-28,Farmers praise 'amazing' support for tractor run,science,BBC,"Thousands of people have gathered to see more than 300 festively decorated tractors on a drive to raise money for charity. Romsey young farmers tractor run saw the convoy travel from Broughton to Romsey to raise money for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance, and Southampton Children's Hospital. Organiser Alex Drake, from Michelmersh Manor Farm, said the support of the general public was ""amazing"" and it was ""definitely the biggest one we've ever had"" with 308 tractors involved. He added: ""The amount of money that's getting handed over into our pots and buckets is absolutely incredible."" He said the event was also ""a good blow out"" for British farmers who he said had experienced a difficult year. ""So this has a twofold achievement, I suppose, of raising awareness of British farming and raising money for charity,"" Mr Drake said. Alongside the Christmassy decorations adorning the tractors were British flags and phrases like ""Back British Farming"". Mr Drake said: ""For the British public, they need our food, we need them and if they want low food miles, with low costs, with no importations or less importations, they need to support us to keep us going.

2025-09-26,Ratmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our cities,science,BBC,"Days later he noticed a pungent smell too. It was musty and slightly astringent, not unlike the communal bin area in his block of flats. ""I knew what it was straight away,"" he says. ""Rats."" He'd often seen them scurrying around near bins. Now they were inside his home too. ""I heard them in the cupboards and behind the bath panel. One morning when I woke up they were fighting under the bath, screaming and squealing."" Mr Gladwin, who lives in Croydon with his five children, acted immediately. He put down peppermint oil and rat poison and so far they haven't returned. But the experience shook him. ""I was worried for the children's health, I didn't want them catching anything."" There was another feeling too: shame. ""It's not nice to say we're infested, that our family is living in a rat-infested property."" Cleankill, the pest control company tasked with tackling the infestation on Mr Gladwin's estate, works across the south of England. Its founder, Clive Bury says he has seen a ""remarkable"" increase in call outs for rat activity, estimating a 20% increase in the last two years. Similar patterns are being reported across the country. Trade body the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) says more than half of the pest control companies who are members have seen an increased number of rat callouts over the last five years. Rats live in drains, sewers and burrows, and emerge mostly at night, so counting them is nearly impossible and estimates on rat population figures vary. In the UK it could be anywhere from 10 million to 120 million. What is known is that more than half a million rodent infestations were reported to UK councils, between 2023 and the middle of this year, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by repair company, Drain Detectives. But it's not just affecting the UK. Rat numbers are reported to have spiked in several US cities too, including Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City, as well as in Amsterdam and Toronto. Though they're not inherently dirty animals, rats scavenge in sewers and bins and can pass on serious diseases to humans. Leptospirosis (Weil's disease) is transmitted through their urine, and hantavirus can be spread by breathing in infected droppings. They can also eat their way through farm produce and contaminate food supplies. So, given rats have shown themselves to be wily in avoiding being caught - what would it really take to stop them? Or are we too far gone to prevent rats from overrunning our cities? Bobby Corrigan calls himself an urban rodentologist. He started out as an exterminator in New York City and has spent his life immersed in rats. ""I ended up in sewers, trying to hang poison baits to kill rats."" Years later, while studying rats in college, he went to extreme lengths to understand their behaviours - once he slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe it first hand. What astonished him was their complex social structure, and evidence of what he believed to be signs of altruism. ""I saw young rats carrying food and giving it to older rats that couldn't get around,"" he remembers. He was also determined to understand the reasons for the rise. There are many possible reasons for this. Niall Gallagher, technical manager at the BPCA, says our growing appetite for fast food, the fact some councils collect rubbish less frequently, as well as road and building works disturbing the sewer network, all contribute. But there is evidence that rising temperatures might also be at play. Scientific evidence has found that rat populations are sensitive to temperature but Dr Corrigan, who previously worked at the New York City Department of Health as a research scientist, together with researchers from the University of Richmond, Virginia, set out to find out whether the rise in rat activity correlated to temperature increases. Their study examined 16 cities, mostly in North America, and the results, published in the journal Science Advances earlier this year, found that 11 of them recorded significant increases in rat activity over a period of between seven and 17 years. In Washington DC the increase was almost 400%, in San Francisco it was 300%, Toronto 180% and New York 160%. Only three cities saw declines, including Tokyo and New Orleans. ""Cities experiencing greater temperature increases over time saw larger increases in rats,"" the study found. Those increases approached 2C in some places during the study period. Dr Corrigan believes that - as long as temperatures continue to rise, and in particular winters become warmer - the increase in rat numbers is likely to continue. And global temperatures are indeed set to rise between at least 1.9C and 2.7C above the pre-industrial average by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of independent climate researchers. Rats are phenomenal breeders. A female typically has around six litters a year, each with up to 12 pups. Those rats can start breeding after nine weeks, meaning two rats can potentially create more than 1,000 offspring in a single year. Researchers say numbers are particularly prone to increase in cities. That's because their  heat-trapping tarmac and buildings tend to warm more quickly than rural areas. And the trend of people moving from rural areas to cities is playing a part too, according to Dr Corrigan. ""Land is disappearing like crazy, and we're putting up buildings so we reduce their [rats] habitat in the wild,"" he says. Extra buildings means more nooks, pipes and drains for rats to live in. Which all adds to the challenge of how to best control growing populations. One of the curious facts about rats - and one begins to explain why poison baits often don't work - is that they cannot vomit. In theory this means that once rat poison is ingested, they can't get rid of it. But rats are also ""neophobic"" or fearful of new things, according to Professor Steven Belmain, a professor of ecology at the University of Greenwich. He believes the two points are related. It is something of a ""superpower"", he says, as when they come across a potential food they don't just dive in. ""They will only try a little bit. So once they understand that they don't feel ill, they'll realise, 'okay, I can eat that'. ""You could argue that this cautious approach to life has stood them well."" Dr Alan Buckle of the University of Reading has spent 30 years working to develop new rat poisons but - he tells me with a laugh - ""I failed"". If a poison tastes bad or causes any discomfort or pain to a rat, they will not eat more. Which is why slower-acting substances, mainly anticoagulants - drugs that stop blood forming into clots - are used. These take up to a week to act, giving enough time for rats to eat a lethal dose. But they are recognised as a cruel way to die, killing the rats by causing internal bleeding. What's more, in recent years rats have developed genetic mutations that give them some immunity to these powerful drugs too. Some researchers are looking at the possibility of using oral contraceptives as an alternative, more humane way to prevent rat numbers growing further. Few know this challenge better than Kathleen Corradi, a former schoolteacher who was appointed the city's Rat Tsar by the New York Mayor in 2023. An estimated three million rats live in the five boroughs and Corradi was reportedly awarded $3.5m (£2.6m) to increase public awareness about rat mitigation. She started what she calls a ""rat academy"" that teaches people how to stop their neighbourhood from being overrun by rats. ""They take a rat walk with me, where we go out into neighbourhoods, and we talk about human behaviour and we talk about rat behaviour,"" she told the BBC earlier this month. ""We talk about how it all comes together and what they could be doing in their neighbourhoods."" Her team also urged New York residents to phone in if they see rats or evidence of behaviours likely to encourage rats. Inspectors investigate the reports and order action, with stiff fines if it isn't taken. And there was another crucial change – instead of putting their rubbish out on the street in plastic bags, now most New Yorkers are obliged to put their waste in rat-proof bins. Corradi is now leaving the role, but she says the approach is showing some progress. Ultimately, she explained, ""cutting off rats' food source is the key to a sustained reduction"". Back in Croydon, Alex Donnovan, a pest controller for Cleankill, leads me into the backyard of the estate where John Gladwin lives. It is just after dawn, and he gestures for me to stay still and keep quiet. Moments later, there is a rustling and a rat darts from beneath the concrete walkway towards the communal bins. Next, the head of a large rat emerges from a burrow at the end of the garden. During the two hours we spent on the estate, some rats climbed high into a tree, while a particularly brazen one jumped into a bin and pulled a hunk of food from a plastic bag while I watched on, less than a metre away. Mr Donnovan believes it is almost impossible to get control of an infestation of this scale. ""There's just so much food."" He gestures to bins overflowing with rubbish bags. ""Even if we put down rodenticide, they won't eat it. They are just not interested… Once these bins are infested with rats, the bin men don't want to collect it either."" Warmer temperatures may well help fuel growing rat populations but our overflowing bins, fondness for fast food and fractured communities all add to the challenge of keeping it under control. In the UK there are more people than ever are living in closer proximity. The Office for National Statistics projects the population will increase from 67.6 million in 2022 to 72.5 million by 2032, with the proportion living in urban areas growing too. So, instead of hoping poison will do the trick, the solution could come down to something far more straightforward. ""If we take care of our city environment, then we won't have to worry about being so inhumane to them,"" argues Dr Corrigan. ""By not giving [rats access to] the food and scraps, then we don't have to poison them and kill them and torture them and all the crazy things we do to them."" The challenge now is how to do that, and at speed. After all, as he puts it, we have already ""underestimated them"". ""We ignored rats and let them get out of hand… and now we are paying the price."" to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

2025-12-17,Spain to open network of climate shelters,science,BBC,"Spain is to set up a national network of climate shelters in public buildings to offer people refuge from intense heat before next summer, its prime minister has announced. The move was announced as Pedro Sanchez laid out a plan to address the impact of climate change during a conference in Madrid on Wednesday. ""Devastating droughts and heatwaves are no longer rare. Some summers, it's not separate waves we face, but one long heatwave stretching from June through August. This is now the new normal,"" he said. Spain experienced its hottest summer and three heatwaves in 2025. A 16-day heatwave in August saw temperatures exceed 45C (113F), according to the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). As part of the national network of shelters, spaces to stay cool will be available to everyone, Sanchez said. Shelters will be funded by the government in areas ""that need them most, where the heat really hits people the hardest,"" he added. The rollout will be in addition to existing networks already set up by regional governments including in Catalonia, the Basque Country and Murcia. In Barcelona - the capital of the Catalonia region - about 400 climate shelters already exist in buildings including libraries, museums, sports facilities and shopping malls. The air conditioned spaces, usually with seating and free water, are meant to provide people with a refuge from the heat, particularly those with health problems, older people, babies, and those with limited resources. Sanchez also announced that the government would fund flood prevention plans in small towns, with €20m (£18m; $24m) also designated for fire prevention plans in small towns, as part of a state pact to address climate change. The set of proposals are yet to be brought before the Congress of Deputies, lower house of Spain's Parliament. Sanchez has asked other political groups to contribute to the pact, saying it is ""not an electoral weapon... it is a shield for Spain"". Heatwaves are becoming more common and intense due to human-caused climate change, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. More than 3,800 heat-related deaths were recorded in Spain amid searing temperatures this summer - 88% more than in 2024 -  according to estimates by the During 2025, Spain also experienced a , with over 400,000 hectares burned.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj8ew1pnlo
2025-10-29,Britain's energy bills problem - and why firms are paid huge sums to stop producing power,science,BBC,"The two farms are 13 miles off the north-east coast of Scotland and include some of the biggest wind turbines in the UK, at 257m high. With winds like that they should be operating at maximum capacity, generating what the developer, Ocean Winds, claims is enough power to meet the electricity needs of well over a million homes. That's because if you thought that once an electricity generator - whether it be a wind farm or a gas-powered plant - was connected to the national grid it could seamlessly send its electricity wherever it was needed in the country, you'd be wrong. The electricity grid was built to deliver power generated by coal and gas plants near the country's major cities and towns, and doesn't always have sufficient capacity in the wires that carry electricity around the country to get the new renewable electricity generated way out in the wild seas and rural areas. And this has major consequences. The way the system currently works means a company like Ocean Winds gets what are effectively compensation payments if the system can't take the power its wind turbines are generating and it has to turn down its output. It means Ocean winds was paid £72,000 not to generate power from its wind farms in the Moray Firth during a half-hour period on 3 June because the system was overloaded - one of a number of occasions output was restricted that day. At the same time, 44 miles (70km) east of London, the Grain gas-fired power station on the Thames Estuary was paid £43,000 to provide more electricity. Payments like that happen virtually every day. Seagreen, Scotland's largest wind farm, was paid £65 million last year to restrict its output 71% of the time, according to analysis by Octopus Energy. Balancing the grid in this way has already cost the country more than £500 million this year alone, the company's analysis shows. The total could reach almost £8bn a year by 2030, warns the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), the body in charge of the electricity network. It's pushing up all our energy bills and calling into question the government's promise that net zero would end up delivering cheaper electricity. Now, the government is considering a radical solution: instead of one big, national electricity market, there'll be a number of smaller regional markets, with the government gambling that this could make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills. But in reality, it's not guaranteed that anyone will get cheaper bills. And even if some people do, many others elsewhere in the country could end up paying more. The proposals have sparked such bitter debate that one senior energy industry executive called it ""the most vicious policy fight"" he has ever known. He has, he says, ""lost friends"" over it. Meanwhile, political opponents who claim net zero is an expensive dead end are only too ready to pounce. It is reported that the Prime Minister has asked to review the details of what some newspapers are calling a ""postcode pricing"" plan. So is the government really ready to risk the most radical shake-up of the UK electricity market since privatisation 35 years ago? And what will it really mean for our bills? The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, is certainly in a fix. His net zero policy is under attack like never before. The Tories have come out against it, green politicians say it isn't delivering for ordinary people, and even Tony Blair has weighed in against it. Meanwhile Reform UK has identified the policy as a major Achilles heel for the Labour government. ""The next election will be fought on two issues, immigration and net stupid zero,"" says Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice. ""And we are going to win."" Poll after poll says cost of living is a much more important for most people, and people often specifically cite concerns about rising energy prices. Miliband sold his aggressive clean energy policies in part on cutting costs. He said that ensuring 95% of the country's electricity comes from low-carbon sources by 2030 would slash the average electricity bill by £300. But the potential for renewables to deliver lower costs just isn't coming through to consumers. Renewables now generate more than half the country's electricity, but because of the limits to how much electricity can be moved around the system, even on windy days some gas generation is almost always needed to top the system up. And because gas tends to be more expensive, it Supporters of the government's plan argue that, as long as prices continue to be set at a national level, the hold gas has on the cost of electricity will be hard to break. Less so with regional – or, in the jargon, ""zonal"" - pricing. Think of Scotland, blessed with vast wind resources but just 5.5 million people. The argument goes that if prices were set locally, it wouldn't be necessary to pay wind farms to be turned down because there wasn't enough capacity in the cables to carry all the electricity into England. On a windy day like 3 June, they would have to sell that spare power to local people instead of into a national market. The theory is prices would fall dramatically – on some days Scottish customers might even get their electricity for free. Other areas with lots of renewable power - such as Yorkshire and the North East, as well as parts of Wales - would stand to benefit too. And, as solar investment increases in Lincolnshire and other parts of the east of England, they could also see prices tumble. All that cheap power could also transform the economics of industry. Supporters argue that it would attract energy-intensive businesses such as data centres, chemical companies and other manufacturing industries. In London and much of the south of England, the price of electricity would sometimes be higher than in the windy north. But supporters say some of the hundreds of millions of pounds the system would save could be used to make sure no one pays more than they do now. And those higher prices could also encourage investors to build new wind farms and solar plants closer to where the demand is. The argument is that would lower prices in the long run and bring another benefit - less electricity would need to be carried around the country, so we would need fewer new pylons, saving everyone money and meaning less clutter in the countryside. ""Zonal pricing would make the energy system as a whole dramatically more efficient, slashing this waste and cutting bills for every family and business in the country,"" argues Greg Jackson, the CEO of Octopus Energy, one of the biggest energy suppliers in the UK. Research commissioned by the company estimates the savings could top £55 billion by 2050 - which it claims could knock £50 to £100 a year off the average bill. Octopus points out Sweden made the switch to regional pricing in just 18 months. The supporters of regional pricing include NESO, Citizens Advice and the head of the energy regulator, Ofgem. Last week a committee of the House of Lords recommended the country should switch to the system. There are, however, many businesses involved in building and running renewable energy plants that oppose the move. ""We're making billions of pounds of investments in renewable power in the UK every year,"" says Tom Glover, the UK chair of the giant German power company RWE. ""I can't go to my board and say let's take a bet on billions of pounds of investment."" He's worried changing the way energy is priced could undermine contracts and make revenues more uncertain. And he says it risks undermining the government's big push to switch to green energy. The main cost of wind and solar plants is in the build. It means the price of the energy they produce is very closely tied to the cost of building and, because developers borrow most of the money, that means the interest rates they are charged. And we are talking a lot of money. The government is expecting power companies to spend £40bn pounds a year over the next five years on renewable projects in the UK. Glover says even a very small change in interest rates could have dramatic effects on how much renewable infrastructure is built and how much the power from it costs. ""Those additional costs could quickly overwhelm any of the benefits of regional pricing,"" says Stephen Woodhouse, an economist with the consultancy firm AFRY, which has studied the impact of regional pricing for the power companies. That would come as already high interest rates have combined with rising prices for steel and other materials to push up the cost of renewables. Plans for a huge wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire were cancelled last month because the developer said it no longer made economic sense. And there's another consideration, he says. The National Grid, which owns the pylons, substations and cables that move electricity around the country, is already rolling out a huge investment programme – some £60bn over the next five years - to upgrade the system ready for the new world of clean power. That new infrastructure will mean more capacity to bring electricity from our windy northern coasts down south, and therefore also mean fewer savings from a regional pricing system in the future. There are other arguments too. Critics warn introducing regional pricing could take years, that energy-intensive businesses like British Steel can't just up sticks and move, and that the system will be unfair because some customers will pay more than others. But according to Greg Jackson of Octopus, the power companies and their backers just want to protect their profits. ""Unsurprisingly, it's the companies that enjoy attractive returns from this absurd system who are lobbying hard to maintain the status quo,"" he says. Yet the power companies say Octopus has a vested interest too. It is the UK's biggest energy supplier with some seven million customers, and owns a sophisticated billing system it licenses to other suppliers, so could gain from changes to the way electricity is priced, they claim. And the clock is ticking. Whether the government meets its clean power targets will depend on how many new wind farms and solar plants are built. The companies who will build them say they need certainty around the future of the electricity market, so a decision must be taken soon. It's expected in the next couple of weeks.

2025-12-16,Government rolls back nature protections to boost housing,science,BBC,"More housing developments will be exempt from rules requiring builders in England to improve wildlife habitats, the government said on Tuesday. Ministers have been reviewing rules known as Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG), under which builders must compensate for the loss of nature on housing developments. Increasing the size of exempted developments has sparked anger from nature charities, who warned it risked stalling nature recovery. The changes are part of an overhaul of planning rules which the government said would help achieve its target of building 1.5 million new homes in this Parliament. The changes were one of a raft of reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework unveiled by Matthew Pennycook, Minister of State for Housing, to ""get Britain building again"". ""They will not be without their critics. But in the face of a housing crisis that has become a genuine emergency in parts of Britain, we will act where previous governments have failed,"" he said. Other reforms include giving a ""default yes"" to planning applications near railway stations, including on green belt land, and a requirement that new builds include nature-friendly features, such as installing swift bricks, to support wildlife. Biodiversity Net Gain, which requires developments in England to increase biodiversity by 10%, has been in place for less than two years. Several nature-focused groups and charities jointly criticised the government's decision to lessen its impact. Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of conservation groups, said the revisions risk ""hollowing-out one of the most important nature protection policies in a generation."" ""It's good that exemptions are narrower than originally proposed, but this is still damage limitation, not positive leadership for nature,"" he said. But critics of the BNG principle have complained that the policy can increase costs and cause delays in the planning process, particularly for smaller developers, making some projects unviable. The policy has made building ""harder, more expensive and more complicated"", said Rico Wojtulewicz of the building trade body, the National Federation of Builders. The changes to England's Biodiversity Net gain rules exclude developments under 2,000 sq m of land under a drive to make it easier to build homes on smaller sites. The government says this will apply to an estimated 12,500 homes a year. Other options in the consultation had included exempting bigger sites of up to 10,000 sq m (roughly one or two football fields). Speaking alongside Mr Benwell in an interview with the BBC, Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, accused the government of trying to ""scapegoat nature for a failing economy"". ""The British people want to see development for the economy and for nature at the same time and yet this government seems intent on pitching them as one against the other,"" he told BBC News. The government has also said it will consult on expanding exemptions on brownfield sites of up to 25,000 sq m in size and will introduce measures to make it easier, quicker, and cheaper for medium-sized developments to deliver off-site nature improvements.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r7zp418p8o
2025-12-23,"'This is our future,' climate adviser warns as 2025 to break heat records",science,BBC,"Rising temperatures in the UK will become ""the new normal"", a leading government climate adviser has warned, as she called for more to be done to prepare for the impacts of climate change. It comes as the Met Office revealed 2025 was on course to be the UK's hottest year since records began, with climate change continuing to drive higher temperatures. With just over a week still to go, the average UK air temperature across 2025 is on track to end up at about 10.05C, which would edge out the current record of 10.03C from 2022. ""This is our future, encapsulated in data,"" Professor Rachel Kyte told the BBC. ""Now the question is 'how are we going to prepare ourselves and build our resilience to this?'"" A lack of rainfall and persistent warmth left the country vulnerable to droughts and wildfires through the spring and summer. While temperatures vary naturally from year to year, scientists could not be clearer that human-caused climate change is driving the UK's rapidly warming trend. ""The pollution [carbon dioxide] we've put in for the last 20-30 years is now what is driving this warmth, and so not curbing emissions well enough means we're going to continue to see these kinds of impacts,"" Prof Kyte, the UK's special representative for climate, said. She said the UK needed to become ""resilient"" to the inevitability of higher temperatures through further investment in nature and infrastructure. ""If we don't invest in our adaptation now, it's going to cost us way more,"" she warned. By the end of 2025, the UK's 10 warmest years on record will all have taken place in the last two decades, in measurements going back to the late 1800s. ""Anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change is causing the warming in the UK as it's causing the warming across the world,"" said Amy Doherty, a climate scientist at the Met Office. ""What we have seen in the past 40 years, and what we're going to continue to see, is more records broken, more extremely hot years [...] so what was normal 10 years ago, 20 years ago, will become [relatively] cool in the future,"" she told BBC News. The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year are 2C below the long-term December average, with slightly cooler conditions expected over Christmas. So while the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, it is the most likely outcome. It would be the sixth time this century that the UK has set a new annual temperature record, following 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014 and 2022. ""The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th Century,"" said Mike Kendon, another climate scientist at the Met Office. The expected new record of 2025 has been built on persistent heat through the spring and summer. Those long, hot, sunny days may feel like a distant memory as we head towards Christmas, but both were the UK's warmest ever recorded. Each month from March to August was more than 2C above the long-term average between 1961 and 1990. Temperatures peaked at 35.8C - well below the highs of more than 40C seen in July 2022 - but hot spells happened repeatedly. Four separate - albeit relatively short-lived - heatwaves were declared across much of the country. The UK Health Security Agency also issued several heat-health alerts through the summer. Mr Kendon said longer spells of hotter days and nights posed an increased risk to elderly and vulnerable people. He told the Today programme it would also have an impact on the agriculture sector, influencing which crops farmers are able to grow in the UK. Spring and summer were also marked by low rainfall. Spring was particularly dry - the UK's sixth driest since 1836. Combined with the warm weather helping to dry out the soils, this lack of rainfall pushed large parts of the country towards drought. across several regions in England and Wales, by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales respectively. Parts of eastern Scotland also entered ""significant water scarcity"", according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Recent rainfall has eased the situation across much of the country and most areas are no longer in official drought. But water levels are still below average in some places. ""There's a huge deficit to be made up, and there's a huge implication, not just for people who are farming the land [and] growing food, but our rivers, our aquifers, our availability of drinking water,"" said Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading. The repeated swings between drought and flooding were making it very hard for communities to adapt to increasing weather extremes, she added. The prolonged dry, warm weather created ideal conditions for wildfires too. By late April, the area of the UK burned by wildfires had already reached , according to data from the Global Wildfires Information System going back to 2012. More than 47,100 hectares (471 sq km or 182 sq miles) has now been burned throughout 2025 - smashing the previous high of 28,100 hectares of 2019. Andy Cole, chief fire officer at Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters in his region had responded to more than 1,000 wildfires this year - an ""unprecedented"" number, he said. ""I've been doing this for over 20 years and we've seen a marked increase in the number of fires we're having to deal with in the open,"" he told the Today programme. As the UK continues to heat up - driven by humanity's greenhouse gas emissions - scientists expect the UK to experience more weather extremes. ""The conditions that people are going to experience are going to continue to change as they have in the last few years [with] more wildfires, more droughts, more heatwaves,"" said Dr Doherty. ""But also it's going to get wetter in the winter half-year, so from October to March [...] the rain that does fall will fall more intensely, and in heavier rain showers, causing that kind of flooding that we've been seeing this year as well,"" she added. The UK has not been alone in experiencing extreme heat this year. The world is on course for its second or third warmest year ever recorded, according to the European Copernicus climate service. But the international consensus on tackling climate change is also being tested, with the US and some other leading producers of fossil fuels rowing back on their net zero commitments. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

2025-12-29,'I've been rescuing hedgehogs in my garden for 25 years',science,BBC,"For 25 years, Joan Lockley has run a hedgehog rescue from her Staffordshire garden. The 82-year-old says she helped more than 600 of the animals over the past 12 months from her ""hosprickle"" at her home in Cheslyn Hay. This year, she was awarded a British Empire Medal for her efforts in running West Midlands Hedgehog Rescue. She says she will never stop doing what she can to protect the animals. ""It started with one hedgehog that walked across my garden,"" she said. ""And the only thing I knew about hedgehogs then was that you should never see them in the daytime."" She boxed the hedgehog up, she said, and sought advice from a vet and another hedgehog rescue about how to care for it herself. ""And then I got hooked on them,"" Joan added. ""People started bringing them in, I became a member of the Hedgehog Preservation Society,  and over the years the numbers grew and grew and grew. ""They are magic, I don't know anyone who doesn't like hedgehogs."" Joan has space for 36 hedgehogs at home, but says this year she has seen fewer than in previous years, having rescued more than 800 in 2024. According to the latest State of Britain's hedgehogs report, numbers of hedgehogs have fallen by up to 30% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas since the Millennium. For her efforts in caring for hedgehogs, she was rewarded with a British Empire Medal. ""I couldn't believe it, I thought somebody was pulling my leg"", she said. ""You don't realise that people can see the work that you're doing."" And despite describing running the rescue as ""hard work"", she says she has no intention of stopping. For anyone who wants to help the hedgehogs in their garden, she said: ""I always recommend cat biscuits, or kitten biscuits, and always water. ""People think that come the autumn hedgehogs hibernate, they don't all hibernate. ""So keep feeding and putting water out 12 months of the year just to attract them and look after them.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqz42jkk8wo
2025-12-29,The story of the buried whale's head,science,BBC,"Earlier this year, I found myself standing in a field, watching, as a digger lifted the remains of an enormous fin whale's head from a resting place few people knew about. It was the culmination of an investigation into something I initially thought may be a myth but turned out to be true - a whale's head being buried somewhere in my hometown. On Valentine's Day 2020 the crew of a former Danish fishing boat, collecting rubbish in the sea, delighted in an unusual sight – a whale swimming alongside them near Falmouth in Cornwall. Despite their joy there was concern she was close to the coast and in shallow water. By midday she had beached on rocks at the remote Parbean Cove in the mouth of Helford River. Milo Constantine was 16 at the time and was among the crew members of the Clean Ocean Sailing vessel - The Annette. ""It's like in those films when they meet an alien or something and it's just like so surreal because it's not something you see,"" he told me. The team tried relentlessly to keep the whale hydrated, using dry bags, hoping it could be refloated when the tide came back in. ""The noises it was making, it wasn't just noises, it was like deep bellowing sounds and we were pouring water on it to kind of ease it through its pain,"" he said. ""Every time we put water on it, its mouth would open and it would kind of do a very deep, a whale sound, but it was very, very deep and quite an emotional moment of interaction with the whale. ""And it genuinely did feel like it was saying thank you."" Dozens of other people also made their way to the beach as word spread. By the time a team from British Divers Marine Life Rescue - a frontline response organisation - got to the scene, it was sadly too late for the whale and the autopsy unit was called in to try to find out what had caused her to die. Fin whales are the second largest animal to have ever existed on our planet. This one was a young female, not fully grown but still enormous at nearly 20m (66ft) - about the length of two buses. Although fin whales are migratory there are near-resident populations that hang out in UK waters, especially in the Celtic and Irish seas. Sightings from shore were once rare but more recently have become far more frequent, according to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. It would turn out the stories I had heard about the whale's head being buried related to this particular, incredible animal, and it was more than just a community rumour. Having a fiance, Stuart Bearhop, who worked as a professor of ecology at the University of Exeter proved useful, as he asked around and found out about a semi-secretive mission to save the whale's head from incineration. The man who carried out the mission was scientist Prof Robbie McDonald. He went along to lend a hand at Parbean Cove and like everyone else was struck by the sheer size of the whale and its tragic death. Recalling the day, he said: ""There's lots of different people having different experiences there… on one side of the animal there was a group of scientists thinking about how are we going to take samples and on the other side there were people mourning its passing, saying quiet little prayers. ""Somebody had placed a bunch of flowers on the whale's fin and there were lots of different people taking different meanings from this animal that had died on the beach."" If left on the shore the whale's body would have posed a biohazard risk so the plan was for it to be disposed of, either by being rendered, sunk or incinerated, which is the responsibility of the land owner. It was while these plans were developing that Prof McDonald made his bid for the head. ""Because it would've just been sunk out to sea or rendered... a sad ending,"" he said. ""So the intention was that we make this something of a monument to that moment, to that animal, to that place, jutting out into the Atlantic, and for all the people who connected with it that day, and keep that for the future."" Acquiring the head was not straight forward. The whale was lying on the foreshore where the Duchy of Cornwall has special royal rights and privileges. The Duchy is the private estate of the eldest son of the British Monarch and at the time in 2020 that was Prince Charles. The Duchy had released a statement saying the whale would be disposed of ""sensitively over the coming days"". Prof McDonald said: ""There's lots of biohazards associated with it so I had to do a lot of persuading and show I had the requisite papers. ""I think their worries were understandable. ""There are a lot of concerns that people have for animals like whales, and they wanted to get the job done efficiently but also sensitively which is perfectly sensible. ""And there I was trying to make life difficult by saying, 'please don't throw it away'. But, to their great credit, they let me have it."" When he finally got the head, it was just before the onset of the Covid pandemic and lockdown and with the need to also be respectful, the job of burying it was done quickly and quietly. ""I suppose that's why it became an urban myth, but it was not my intention for it to be a secret,"" he recalled. ""It was just at a time when there were much more important things for people to think about, so I didn't really talk about it."" The remainder of the whale was dealt with by the landowner but the head was kept in tact for Prof McDonald and taken by trailer up to the University of Exeter campus in Penryn, Cornwall. He buried the head packed with rich fertiliser to facilitate decomposition. The organisms in the soil strip the bones of any remaining flesh and tissues, and so getting them to a condition where they could be displayed. As part of my investigations for the podcast I spent some time in London - 300 miles from where the whale washed up. I visited Sophie Nicolov of the Natural History Museum's whale, dolphin and porpoise collection, which consists of thousands of bones at a secret location and not on display to the general public. I also went to the autopsy rooms at Regent's Park beside London Zoo where I met Rob Deaville, who did the post-mortem examination on the whale. There I learned how experts can spot the man-made threats that can cause some whales to strand and die, and how some of the chemicals we use in everyday life can be harmful to marine wildlife. Unlike most creatures that wash up, its necropsy was not the end of the story for our whale. Prof Macdonald had buried her head, both for science and as a monument to these beautiful creatures. When plans were submitted for a wind farm in the field outside Falmouth where the head was buried, Prof McDonald started to look at how best to retrieve it. However, he got a new job out of Cornwall before being able to do it, leaving the university with a two-tonne whale's head under its premises, and nobody obvious to deal with it. Stuart Bearhop does not know much about digging up whales, and he is not a whale biologist but the job of excavating it had to fall to someone, and the university decided it would be him - probably because he had been the one who started asking questions, on my behalf. Left too long in the ground the bones would start to break down. To help with the sizeable task was Paul White, a former Royal Marine who usually works excavating live electricity cables and utilities. Also on hand were Johnny Nicolas, who lays slabbing for housing developments, and David Hatton who is a digger master. They had with them a vacuum excavator usually used for working around live electricity cables and gas pipes. A huge lorry would suck up all the soil from around the skull, making it easier to then be winched out on a digger arm. Over the course of the next 10 hours I watched as the team, with great care and precision, painstakingly extracted the whale's head from its resting place. The bones were more fragile than anticipated with plant roots having worked their way into spaces left by veins and blood vessels. Broken fragments were collected and put to one side with the team feeling the heavy responsibility of keeping the prized whale in as close to one piece as possible. The critical point came when the soil had been removed, and a series of straps had been looped around the skull and the digger arm. As it was slowly and expertly winched out there was a real concern the weight of the skull may crush itself. If Prof Macdonald's plan for the head to go on display was to become a reality, it would need to be kept together. Eventually, after several attempts, the whale's head emerged in nearly one piece from her shallow grave and into the sun. She will understandably need to be patched up in places, and there are specialists to carry out this work. For now, this whale's head has been through enough and has been left to dry out in the open air until the next chapter in her storied after-life.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yrj7d982o
2025-08-02,Melting glaciers threaten to wipe out European villages - is the steep cost to protect them worth it?,science,BBC,"Mr Bellwald is a mayor, but this isn't his village. Two months ago his home, three miles away in Blatten, was wiped off the map when part of the mountain and glacier collapsed into the valley. The village's 300 residents had been evacuated days earlier, after geologists warned that the mountain was increasingly unstable. But they lost their homes, their church, their hotels and their farms. Lukas Kalbermatten also lost the hotel that had been in his family for three generations.""The feeling of the village, all the small alleys through the houses, the church, the memories you had when you played there as a child… all this is gone."" Today, he is living in borrowed accommodation in the village of Wiler. Mr Bellwald has a temporary office there too, where he is supervising the massive clean-up operation - and the rebuild. The good news is, he believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with the first new houses ready by 2029. But it comes with a hefty pricetag. Rebuilding Blatten is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 million (USD) per resident. Voluntary contributions from the public quickly raised millions of Swiss francs to help those who had lost their homes. The federal government and the canton promised financial support too. But some in Switzerland are asking: is it worth it? Though the disaster shocked Switzerland, some two thirds of the country is mountainous, and climate scientists warn that the glaciers and the permafrost – the glue that holds the mountains together – are thawing as the global temperature increases, making landslides more likely. Protecting areas will be costly. Switzerland spends almost $500m a year on protective structures, but a report carried out in 2007 for the Swiss parliament suggested real protection against natural hazards could cost six times that. Is that a worthwhile investment? Or should the country - and residents - really consider the painful option of abandoning some of their villages? The Alps are an integral part of Swiss identity. Each valley, like the Loetschental, has its own culture. Mr Kalbermatten used to take pride in showing hotel guests the ancient wooden houses in Blatten. Sometimes he taught them a few words of Leetschär, the local dialect. Losing Blatten, and the prospect of losing others like it, has made many Swiss ask themselves how many of those alpine traditions could disappear. Today, Blatten lies under millions of cubic metres of rock, mud, and ice. Above it, the mountain remains unstable. When they were first evacuated, Blatten's residents, knowing their houses had stood there for centuries, believed it was a purely precautionary measure. They would be home again soon, they thought. Fernando Lehner, a retired businessman, says no one expected ""We knew there would be a landslide that day… But it was just unbelievable. I would never have imagined that it would come down so quickly. ""And that explosion, when the glacier and landslide came down into the valley, I'll never forget it. The earth shook."" The people of Blatten, keen to get their homes back as soon as possible, don't want to talk about climate change. They point out that the Alps are always dangerous, and describe the disaster as a once in a millennium event. But climate scientists say global warming is making alpine life more risky. Matthias Huss, a glaciologist with Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology, as well as glacier monitoring group Glamos, argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster. ""The thawing of permafrost at very high elevation led to the collapse of the summit,"" he explains. ""This mountain summit crashed down onto the glacier… and also the glacier retreat led to the fact that the glacier stabilised the mountain less efficiently than before. So climate change was involved at every angle."" Geological changes unrelated to climate change also played a role, he concedes - but he points out that glaciers and permafrost are key stabilising factors across the alps. His team at Glamos has monitored a record shrinkage of the glaciers over the past few years. And average alpine temperatures are increasing. In the days before the mountain crashed down, Switzerland's zero-degree threshold – the altitude at which the temperature reaches freezing point – rose above 5,000 metres, higher than any mountain in the country. ""It is not the very first time that we're seeing big landslides in the Alps,"" says Mr Huss. ""I think what should be worrying us is that these events are becoming more frequent, but also more unpredictable."" A study from November 2024 by the Swiss Federal Research Institute, which reviewed three decades of literature, concurred that climate change was ""rapidly altering high mountain environments, including changing the frequency, dynamic behavior, location, and magnitude of alpine mass movements"", although quantifying the exact impact of climate change was ""difficult"". Graubünden is the largest holiday region in Switzerland, and is popular with skiers and hikers for its untouched nature, alpine views and pretty villages. The Winter Olympics was hosted here twice - in the upmarket resort of St Moritz - while the town of Davos hosts world leaders for the World Economic Forum each year. One village in Graubünden has a different story to tell. Brienz was evacuated more than two years ago because of signs of dangerous instability in the mountain above. Its residents have still not been able to return, and in July heavy rain across Switzerland led geologists to warn a landslide appeared imminent. Elsewhere in Switzerland, above the resort of Kandersteg, in the Bernese Oberland region, a rockface has become unstable, threatening the village. Now residents have an evacuation plan. There too, heavy rain this summer raised the alarm, and some hiking trails up to Oeschinen Lake, a popular tourist attraction, were closed. Some disasters have claimed lives. In 2017, a massive rockslide came down close to the village of Bondo, killing eight hikers. Bondo has since been rebuilt, and refortified, at a cost of $64 million. As far back as 2003, the village of Pontresina spent millions on a protective dam to shore up the thawing permafrost in the mountain above. Not every alpine village is at risk, but the apparent unpredictability is causing huge concern. Blatten, like all Swiss mountain villages, was risk mapped and monitored; that's why its 300 residents were evacuated. Now, questions are being asked about the future of other villages too. In the aftermath of the disaster, there was a huge outpouring of sympathy. But the possible price tag of rebuilding it also came with doubts. An editorial in the influential Neue Zürcher Zeitung questioned Switzerland's traditional - and constitutional - wealth distribution model, which takes tax revenue from urban centres like Zurich to support remote mountain communities. The article described Swiss politicians as being ""caught in an empathy trap"", adding that ""because such incidents are becoming more frequent due to climate change, they are shaking people's willingness to pay for the myth of the Alps, which shapes the nation's identity."" It suggested people living in risky areas of the Alps should consider relocation. Preserving the alpine villages is expensive. And Neue Zürcher Zeitung was not the first to question the cost of saving every alpine community, but its tone angered some. While three quarters of Swiss live in urban areas, many have strong family connections to the mountains. Switzerland may be a wealthy, highly developed, high-tech country now, but its history is rural, marked by poverty and harsh living conditions. Famine in the 19th century caused waves of emigration. Mr Kalbermatten explains that the word ""heimat"" is hugely important in Switzerland. ""Heimat is when you close your eyes and you think about what you did as a child, the place you lived as a child. ""It's a much bigger word than home."" Ask a Swiss person living for decades in Zurich or Geneva, or even New York, where their heimat is, and for many, the answer will be the village they were born in. For Mr Kalbermatten and his sister and brothers, who live in cities, heimat is the valley where people speak Leetschär, the dialect they all still dream in. The fear is that if these valleys become depopulated, other aspects of unique mountain culture could be lost too - like the Tschäggättä, traditional wooden masks, unique to the Loetschental valley. Their origins are mysterious, possibly pagan. Every February, local young men wear them, along with animal skins, and run through the streets. Mr Kalbermatten points to the example of some areas of northern Italy where this loss of culture has happened. ""[Now] there are only abandoned villages, empty houses, and wolves. For many, the answer is no: An opinion poll from research institute, Sotomo, asked 2,790 people what they most cherished about their country. The most common answer? Our beautiful alpine landscape, and our stability. But the poll did not ask what price they were prepared to pay. Boris Previsic, the director of the University of Lucerne's Institute for the Culture of the Alps, says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment. Switzerland's railways, tunnels, cable cars and high alpine passes are masterpieces of engineering, connecting alpine communities. But now, in part because of climate change, he suggests, that confidence is gone. ""The human induced geology is too strong compared to human beings,"" he argues. ""In Switzerland, we thought we could do everything with infrastructure. Now I think we are at ground zero concerning infrastructure."" The village of Blatten had stood for centuries. ""When you are in a village which has existed already for 800 years, you should feel safe. That is what is so shocking."" In his view, it is time to fight against these villages dying out. ""To fight means we have to be more prepared,"" he explains. ""But we have to be more flexible. We have always also to consider evacuation."" At the end of the day, he adds, ""you cannot hold back the whole mountain"". In the village of Wiler, Mr Previsic's point is greeted with a weary smile. ""The mountain always decides,"" agrees Mr Bellwald. ""We know that they are dangerous. We love the mountains, we don't hate them because of that. Our grandfathers lived with them. Our fathers lived with them. And our children will also live with them."" At lunchtime in the local restaurant in Wiler, the tables are filled with clean-up teams, engineers and helicopter crew. The Blatten recovery operation is in full swing. At one table, a man from one of Switzerland's biggest insurance companies sits alone. Every half hour, he is joined by someone, an elderly couple, a middle aged man, a young woman. He buys each a drink, and carefully notes down the details of their lost homes. Outside, along the valley's winding roads, lorries and bulldozers trundle up to the disaster site. Overhead, helicopters carry large chunks of debris. Even the military is involved. Sebastian Neuhaus commands the Swiss army's disaster relief readiness battalion, and says they must press on despite the scale of the task. ""We have to,"" he says. ""There are 300 life histories buried down there."" The abiding feeling is one of stubborn determination to carry on. ""If we see someone from Blatten, we hug each other,"" says Mr Kalbermatten. ""Sometimes we say, 'it's nice, you're still here.' And that's the most important thing, we are all still here.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w9ggzxv4o
2025-12-29,"3,000 BC find takes archaeologists by surprise",science,BBC,"A 5,000-year-old axe head and the remains of Roman buildings are among the finds that have been unearthed near Lincoln. Archaeologists working along the route of the planned North Hykeham Relief Road said they had found evidence of a previously undiscovered Roman dwelling near Bracebridge Heath. Chris Clay, of Allen Archaeologist Ltd, which is carrying out the work, said: ""We expected this to be a Roman site, and that's what we've got, but we've also got hints of much earlier activity going back to about 3,000 BC."" The dig, which began in October 2025 and is due to finish in early 2026, is in an area which will be built over to create the new £208m bypass. Roman walls and a piece of a Roman column have also been found in several pits in a farmer's field off the A607. Mr Clay said they had also unearthed thousands of pieces of Roman pottery and dozens of personal items, such as brooches, bracelets and hair pins, from the period. He said the evidence suggested there were Roman homes outside the city ""just like the big houses we have in prosperous suburbs today"". ""We're only a mile or two outside of Lincoln, which was one of the most important towns in Roman Britain, and there's also amazing views looking out over the Witham Valley, so this could be a nice country residence for a wealthy, high-status Roman family,"" he said. One of the most surprising finds at the site, he said, was a highly polished Neolithic stone axe head, still with its razor-sharp edge, dating to about 3,000 years before Roman Britain began. ""This is a high-status item and wouldn't have been used to chop down trees, it was much too valuable,"" he said. ""Perhaps this site was a meeting point for communities to come together at a special event. ""It's very likely that the axe head was exchanged or traded as a commodity."" Ian George, from Lincolnshire County Council, said the Roman remains were helping historians understand life outside of the town. ""We know a lot about Roman Lincoln but we know very little about the landscape around it and how people used that landscape, so this is putting together something of that picture,"" he said. He said it was ""remarkable"" that the axe head had survived, adding: ""We understand so little about Neolithic Lincolnshire."" The artefacts would be handed to Lincoln Museum and the building remains covered by the new road once the new evidence had been recorded, the council said.

2025-12-02,Mayor says too many families are 'working poor',science,BBC,"West Yorkshire's mayor says scrapping the two-child benefit cap will help families that have jobs but still struggle to make ends meet. Labour's Tracy Brabin has been answering questions on Message the Mayor on BBC Radio Leeds. She has also been talking about when work will resume on the White Rose station in Leeds, her recent trip to Brazil and taxing tourists who visit Yorkshire. Read our takeaways from the interview below or listen to the full interview ""For various circumstances, you might have three children, but just because you have three means you are poorer as a family - it is absolutely shaming. ""In some communities in West Yorkshire, 50% of children are living in poverty. How on Earth are they going to take up the opportunities as we grow the economy if their start in life is so difficult?"" In last week's Budget, the chancellor scrapped a rule that means parents can only claim Universal Credit or tax credits for their first two children. ""I think this Budget is actually quite revolutionary. It has empowered mayors. ""Andy Burnham [Mayor of Greater Manchester] was talking last week about the growth of Greater Manchester being greater than the national average and outstripping London. Who was second? West Yorkshire."" Following the Budget, more parts of England will be given ""integrated"" settlements - meaning all their funding from the government goes into one big pot, and mayors will decide how it is spent. Brabin was asked about new powers to bring in a modest charge for overnight visitors. ""I think it's fair that people pay a tiny amount of money when they come. ""And then that money will be invested in big events, or infrastructure support like better buses. ""If you look at York and North Yorkshire, for Mayor David Skaith, it is in the tens of millions of pounds that he could spend on transport - but we have had 73 million visitors to West Yorkshire in the last year. ""We have some real jewels in the crown in Ilkley, Shipley and Haworth, so a little bit of money will make it better for everyone."" ""I am desperate to sort this out. I know the longer it stays closed the more it is going to cost us. ""It was an agreement before my time as mayor and, quite frankly, we'd never do this again in the way we are doing it."" Work stopped on the White Rose station in Leeds in 2024. It is a project jointly funded by the West Yorkshire Combined Authority and private company Munroe K. The mayor hopes contractors will be back in 2026 - but she says she cannot promise. Brabin faced criticism on social media for going to a climate summit in Brazil that took place ahead of the COP30 conference. ""I was invited by [former New York Mayor Michael] Bloomberg with other mayors from across the globe to discuss what mayors can do to tackle the climate emergency."" The mayor says it was a ""real opportunity"" to help create jobs in the climate economy, which she says is worth £8bn to the region.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y26k3dlp3o
2025-12-28,Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch',science,BBC,"There is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space. An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a ""Big Crunch"". The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation. Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions. Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity. Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other. Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a ""Big Rip"". The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi). Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with. The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project. ""Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,"" he says. from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still. Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were. This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down. ""The fate of the Universe will change,"" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly. ""If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology."" If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together. ""Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility. ""Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,"" says Prof Lee. Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. ""I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,"" he says. ""The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me."" The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy. But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms. ""Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant."" Since the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial. Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny. Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts. Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director. ""Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?"" he says. ""Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one. ""Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17xe5kl78vo
2025-11-27,Cats became our companions much later than you think,science,BBC,"In true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place. A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. ""They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,"" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford. ""That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago."" All modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat. How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists. To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats. The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa. ""Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,"" said Prof Larson. This fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies. Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought. They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China. Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica. And in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene. These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years. The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially ""commensal"" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. ""Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,"" she said. Leopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia. Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s. The research is published in the journal,",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8dvdp9gn7o
2025-05-10,Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere,science,BBC,"Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said. Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. ""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said. Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space. Mr Lemmens explained that the ""re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently"". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft ""should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries"". This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while ""managing the environmental impact of space debris"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vz28nyedo
2025-12-29,I used Lego to design a farm for people who are blind - like me,science,BBC,"Like many children who grow up on farms, Mike Duxbury has a life-long passion for rearing animals and growing crops. But after losing his sight due to glaucoma at six-years-old, he was told that a career in agriculture was an impossibility. That was like a ""red rag to a bull"" he said, and he went on to get a degree in animal nutrition and to set up a farm in Bedfordshire. Now the 57-year-old is developing a farm in Aberdeenshire specifically tailored to help youngsters with disabilities get into agriculture. Designed using Lego bricks, the main farm building will have a classroom, a workshop, as well space for handling animals. As a teenager living on the family farm in Worcestershire, Mike applied for multiple courses but only got one acceptance, from an agricultural college. ""The rest is history,"" he told BBC Scotland News. ""I had a wonderful time. I was no longer that isolated blind individual, I was Mike. ""That changed my life, finally I knew I was normal."" With a degree under his belt, he found work in a diversity role with a communication company before moving back into agriculture. With his wife, Ness, he built an inclusive farm from scratch in Bedfordshire several years ago. But after giving a talk at the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh in 2023 about diversity in agriculture, he was ""inundated"" with interest about setting up something in Scotland. ""Jokingly I said 'give me a farm then'."" He was then offered a 22-acre farm space at Newton of Drummy at Tarland from the MacRobert Trust, which supports charities across the UK. ""It was quite run down, we have turned that around."" His original Lego design for the main farm building was 10 bricks high and needed hundreds of pieces to complete. The actual building now constructed on the site by Rothienorman firm RPD - which has also donated a ram to the project - is about 105ft (32m) long, 40ft (12m) wide and 15ft (4.5m) high. ""They took photographs of my model and together we have done it,"" Mike said. ""The floor plan is what the builders have built from. ""They have been outstanding - most companies would have run a mile. ""I did joke if it would be cheaper to actually build it in Lego. ""It shows how someone blind can work together with someone to create something."" Widened paths, smooth flooring, and handrails will help people with disabilities get around. Mike said knowing the surroundings are safe helps people like him find their way around with confidence. It will predominantly be a livestock and agriculture farm and currently has five beef cattle and a small flock of sheep. This will be followed by pigs, as well as chickens and goats, as well as smaller breeds such as rabbits, for those not used to handling animals. A polytunnel for horticultural work features equipment with adjustable heights, to suit wheelchair users and smaller children. And they plan to open a pumpkin patch for children for Halloween. ""If the site and equipment is accessible it is an opportunity for everyone,"" Mike said. ""It is a space that can be used all year round."" Charity status was set up earlier this year, and Mike thinks about £70,000 is still needed for the project. Fundraising events have been held in areas including Ballater and Clatt. ""We are not a care farm, our point is to get people a better future,"" he said. ""I think what we have here will be a brilliant facility."" Visually-impaired William, 17, from Cumbria has always wanted to be involved with farming. He is on the farm on a residential basis as their first long-term student. ""It's been good, Mike knows what I am capable of and will allow me to do it,"" he said. William already feeds the sheep and cattle on his own. ""That has surprised me,"" he said. ""After my first week I was doing it. ""Most people do not understand, it would be handy for more people to know we are more capable than they think we are."" Mike said: ""I am on his level. William has grabbed the opportunity. We are very proud of him. His attitude has made it, he has overcome things."" They have a student, Duncan, from Stonehaven, who comes in once a week who Ness said had really started to engage with people during his time on the farm. They have also had a female student from America for a week who wants to be involved in agriculture. ""It's good to pass on knowledge,"" Mike said. NFU Scotland said it was ""thrilled"" to see such innovative projects taking shape. ""Initiatives like this open doors for people with visual impairments and other disabilities to experience and pursue careers in farming - opportunities that might otherwise have been out of reach,"" a statement said. And Alan Turner, chairman of Aberdeenshire Council's infrastructure services committee, said the ""excellent"" project had already seen organisations and schools interested in training and placement opportunities. Mike hopes the farm will make a difference for many people. ""We are here to help everybody who wants help with agriculture or independence,"" he said. ""The biggest breakthrough is getting everybody to communicate. You have got to learn to have conversations and be part of a team. ""The seeds have been sown, this is just a start. Disability will never go away, let's embrace it, because everybody has something to contribute.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4zlyqnr0o
2025-11-23,COP30: Five key takeaways from a deeply divisive climate summit,science,BBC,"In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive. Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated. The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change. Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the ""COP of truth"". The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted. And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting. Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible. So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP. The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations. Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that. While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return. Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas. To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion. Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy. The EU were given short shrift by major producers. ""We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,"" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer. Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse. Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP. These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain. They are the richest group of nations still in the but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour. While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of. The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft. The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the ""tripling"" word stayed in the text. So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in. ""Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,"" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics. ""This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union."" The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front. The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself. How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words? How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks? The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore. ""We can't discard it entirely,"" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News. ""But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far."" Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people. It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore. Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an ""implementation cop"" and put a lot of focus on the ""energy agenda"". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant. COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance. For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an ""orchestrated"" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G. 'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking. The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it. They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - ""unilateral"" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive. The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad. If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves. Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials. The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization. The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways. US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here. Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels. ""China kept a low political profile,"" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society. ""And they focussed on making money in the real world."" ""Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position."" to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

2025-12-22,'New reservoirs will help address water shortage',science,BBC,"A water company boss says plans for two new reservoirs and a water recycling plant in Suffolk are essential to safeguard the county's supply for ""generations"". Essex & Suffolk Water provides water to about 1.8 million households in parts of those two counties and part of Norfolk. In a bid to address growing demand, it has recently launched the Suffolk Water Recycling, Transfer and Storage Project. The company's Monisha Gower said the county's long-term water security was under threat, but this scheme could be the answer. ""East Anglia is one of the driest parts of our country,"" she said. ""So we need to carefully plan ahead to secure and maintain the existing supplies – and this project represents a major step forward for securing water for the future."" Suffolk has recently been identified by the Environment Agency as a Seriously Water Stressed Area, which means its long-term water security is under threat. In September, Essex & Suffolk Water reported that Suffolk had experienced its second driest March-May period since 1921. It is hoped that the scheme – part of a wider £1.5bn investment in water projects across the East of England – will ensure ""reliable water supplies for generations to come"". If approved, a water recycling plant capable of producing 11 million litres (2.4 million gallons) of purified water would be built near Lowestoft. Two partly buried reservoirs – one near the existing Lodgewood Water Tower in Sibton, near Saxmundham, and one near Eye airfield – would also be built, storing water for use during dry periods. About 50 miles (80km) of pipelines would be installed. ""We currently have sufficient water supplies to support our existing households and business customers, so that is fine and secure,"" said Ms Gower. ""The challenge we have is meeting the extra demand from new commercial developments and commercial customers who want to connect to our water supplies. ""We need to create the supply capacity and connectivity to be able to do that."" Ms Gower spoke to the BBC after a seven-week consultation period, during which about 1,000 residents attended drop-in sessions to share their views. ""Initial feedback has been broadly supportive and positive, so the community understands the need for this investment and what it would unlock,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vxgv05keo
2025-12-28,"New York blanketed in snow, sparking travel chaos",science,BBC,"New York has woken up to its heaviest snowfall in nearly four years after a winter storm blanketed parts of the US north-east. New York City's Central Park recorded 4.3in (11cm) of snow, its highest since January 2022, while other parts of the state saw up to 7.5in of snow, said the US National Weather Service (NWS). New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in more than half of counties in the state ahead of the storm. On Saturday, more than 900 flights were cancelled, mostly in the New York area, while more than 8,000 were delayed nationwide, according to tracker FlightAware. By early Saturday, about 6-10in of snow had fallen from Syracuse in central New York to Long Island in the south-east of the state. High snowfall was recorded in neighbouring New Jersey, where a state of emergency was also declared, and in Connecticut, where 9.1in of snow fell in Fairfield County. The worst of the storm was over by Saturday morning, but temperatures were below freezing and road conditions hazardous. The NWS warned melting snow could lead to black ice forming on roads and bridges. The state activated a ""code blue"" to bring homeless people inside from the cold.

2025-12-29,Why Britain has a deer problem - leaving damage that costs millions,science,BBC,"""There are herds running up Crawley Road,"" he says. ""Loads congregate at night on the traffic island of the bypass."" Ben, 33, is a gardener, and some of his customers have had deer break down their fences and strip the bark from the trees. He's had a near miss in his car, too. ""I clipped one, poor thing. It darted off into the bushes."" These sorts of scenes have become increasingly common - and that comes with serious economic, social and environmental costs. Deer numbers have rocketed over the last 40 years but since the Covid-19 pandemic, when culling dropped significantly, many deer experts like Jonathan Spencer, a former head of planning and environment at Forest Enterprise (now Forestry England), say the numbers have got completely out of hand. No-one knows exactly how many there are but the Forestry Commission and the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) suggest there may be two million in Britain - a huge increase from the estimated 450,000 in the 1970s, according to the Forestry Commission. Their impact is being widely felt, with the rising numbers leading to problems for drivers, farmers and businesses as well as wildlife and the countryside's natural landscapes. While there are no recent official estimates of the total cost to the UK of damage caused by deer, it's clear that it is substantial. In 2021, Forestry and Land Scotland estimated the cost of the damage caused by deer just to young trees in Scotland's national forests and land at £3m a year. Lucy Manthorpe runs a 400-acre organic arable farm in Suffolk and says she was losing over £10,000 worth of crops a year to deer damage on three fields. To solve it, she has employed a full-time worker whose main job is culling deer. The deer problem is ""costing us as a country,"" she argues. Farmers and landowners can see losses easily run into the tens of thousands, according to the Forestry Commission, and some with high-value crops can see losses of as much as £1m in a year. Tackling rising deer numbers is now seen as a priority by conservationists, farmers and the government alike - in 2022 Defra admitted: ""We need to do more to sustainably manage deer."" The real problem emerges when it comes to deciding how to do that - with some more radical-sounding approaches pioneered overseas, including reintroducing wolves to the landscape. The Countryside Alliance, however, says this would be ""disastrous"". There are few places in the world better suited to deer than modern Britain with its mild climate, open countryside, no animal apex predators and few human hunters. An estimated 350,000 deer are removed from the British landscape annually via hunting and culling, according to the Country Food Trust, but the overall population is still rising - in 2023 parliament was told that up to 750,000 deer a year may need to be culled to keep the population stable. The place where many of us have our closest encounter with a deer is when one of them meets the front of our car. The number of deer killed or injured on UK roads each year could be as high as 74,000, says the AA, leading to hundreds of human injuries and in some cases, fatalities. In October this year a 63-year-old motorcyclist in Oxfordshire died after hitting a deer, an inquest was told. Then there is the impact on woodland. Natural regrowth of trees is almost impossible in areas  of high deer density as they eat any fresh shoots which appear, says Alison Field, president of the Royal Forestry Society. ""The pressure of the deer now has become so great that we've lost the balance out of our landscape."" As far back as 2013, an academic study published in the Journal of Wildlife Management by University of East Anglia researchers suggested that around half of the UK's growing deer population needs to be shot each year to stop devastation of woodlands and birdlife. Some people's gardens have also been affected by deer munching their flora. Large herds of fallow deer cause problems for arable farmers throughout the year, too, trampling freshly planted crops in the spring and then returning to nibble their way through the fields ahead of harvest time. There have been deer in mainland Britain for thousands of years but only two of the now six species that live here are natives, namely red and roe deer. Fallow deer were first introduced by the Romans in small numbers, and the species expanded under the Normans when owning a deer park was a must-have for any self-respecting nobleman. ""A few centuries ago deer were the property of a privileged few in deer parks, royal forests and chases,"" says Mr Spencer. Three other Asiatic species - sika, Chinese water deer and muntjac - all arrived in the late 19th Century. Mr Spencer explains how after the end of World War One, many grand estates fell into disrepair. In turn, park boundaries collapsed and the deer simply walked out. It took a long time for numbers to reach their current level. The 1963 Deer Act introduced restrictions on culling deer and the seasons during which that can happen. By the 1990s, deer had spread so widely that the gaps between separate populations had filled, explains Mr Spencer. He suggests that the decreasing numbers of people who may previously have taken the odd deer for their dinner table is also a factor. An added complication is that technically no-one owns Britain's deer. The law deems them , which literally means a thing belonging to nobody - so responsibility falls to individual landowners. Bringing deer numbers under control could benefit farmers, the environment and communities across the country - but achieving a consensus on how to do that is not straightforward. Some animal rights organisations that oppose deer hunting instead advocate non-lethal methods of management, including darting deer with contraceptives, or building more or better fencing. However, groups including the British Deer Society (BDS), a charity that promotes sustainable deer management, consider these methods to be challenging to implement at scale as the person firing the dart has to get much closer than someone firing a rifle. Fencing can be effective but comes with significant costs, requires ongoing maintenance and also has the unintended consequence of excluding other wildlife from woodlands, the BDS says. Some big rewilding projects - especially those in more remote parts of Scotland, where most red deer in Britain live, according to the Woodland Trust - talk about another, even more dramatic option: the reintroduction of apex predators, and in particular lynx, which were once found across Britain, to control deer numbers. There have also been some initial studies into the effects of reintroducing wolves. While there are no significant rewilding projects talking about using bears in Britain for this purpose, they lived here thousands of years ago and, in other parts of the world, they play a role in controlling deer populations. The environmental campaigner and writer George Monbiot has said wolves and lynx could be relied on to ""get on with the job"". Trees for Life, which has a 10,000-acre rewilding estate in the Scottish Highlands, says: ""Lynx could bring a wide range of ecological and societal benefits to Scotland."" In many parts of mainland Europe, including Italy, Switzerland, and France, lynx and wolves have returned to landscapes over the past 30 years. In 1995, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in the United States to help manage the park's population of Rocky Mountain elk (similar to the red deer) - this was followed by the recovery of forests. Dr Mike Daniel, who runs a Sustainable Deer Management course at the University of the Highlands and Islands in Perth, says: ""Ecologically, wolves and lynx could thrive in the UK."" But such plans would face likely opposition from farmers, landowners and local communities. Countryside Alliance chief executive Tim Bonner says reintroducing wolves would ""bring misery for livestock farmers"". While it might be possible to reintroduce lynx, he says, ""lynx predation could only ever be a small part of the annual cull required to keep numbers in check"". And Dr Daniel agrees that it would be difficult to have wolves and lynx co-exist alongside farms and estates: ""Being honest, it's not a panacea,"" he says. Jonathan Spencer suggests that more radical measures may be required, to ensure long-lasting biodiversity improvements. ""There has to be a lot more recognition of the scale of the problem and some rather hard-hearted approaches like rounding up the deer and shooting them in an enclosure,"" he argues. ""That would go down like a lead brick socially"". The Deer Act 1991 gives protections to wild deer but allows landowners or those with their permission to kill or take deer. Shooting seasons also restrict when some types of deer can be hunted, and there are strict rules around the type of rifles and ammunition that can be used to hunt them. Culling significantly more deer also raises the question of what to do with the carcasses. There is widespread agreement among some of the experts I've spoken to that eating more venison is an attractive option. ""From a human point of view [deer] are a sustainable, natural resource,"" argues Charles Smith-Jones, a technical adviser at the BDS. Venison is considered to be healthier than beef as it is lower in saturated fat and higher in various nutrients. What's more, wild venison - or deer meat that has not been farmed - is also believed to be better for the environment as it has lower associated carbon emissions than farmed meat. (Mr Spencer warns against eating roadkill however, which could be a health risk.) While there are professional cullers, such as Forestry Commission rangers who may shoot hundreds of deer a year, the BDS says 70% of deer shot in Britain are shot by people who are not employed to do it. But there is also the question of what is most humane - and best - for the animals. Elisa Allen, vice-president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), says: ""We don't need to eat deer – and deer don't wish to be eaten."" She calls instead for ""humane, sustainable methods of population control"". Part of the problem is the fact that this is left up to individual landowners to resolve, resulting in inconsistencies. So, for example, measures taken by one landowner to manage deer on their property can be undone by a neighbour who decides not to do the same (as deer are pretty good at jumping walls and getting under fences). The place where all these issues arguably come into starkest contrast is in Scotland, which is also home to Britain's largest deer-stalking estates and rewilding projects. A law to introduce new powers to tackle numbers in areas facing climate and biodiversity crises is currently passing through the Scottish Parliament. Scottish Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie says he wants to see ""a voluntary partnership with land managers and deer management groups"". In England, the government previously ran a consultation on deer management proposals, however its conclusions remain unpublished. A Defra spokesperson said: ""There is a range of government support and grants available to help land managers manage these impacts, and we will be setting out further measures in due course."" The Welsh government says it is looking at ways to take forward its Wild Deer Management strategy, published in 2021. Many of the same problems are faced across the island of Ireland where deer numbers have also risen significantly. Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs told us the impact of damage caused by deer is ""reviewed on an annual basis"". But while governments in all parts of the UK may face tougher decisions ahead if they really want to bring deer numbers under control, the example of Lucy Manthorpe's farm shows the change that can be made to the landscape if the issue is tackled. Since she hired staff to deal with it, areas that were barren ground have begun bursting with oxlips and early purple orchids. Rare trees are growing again too, she says. The farm has also recorded significant increases in moths and breeding birds. ""The deer are not deciding what's going to happen any more,"" she tells me. ""Nature is deciding.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d93xzey70o
2025-10-17,Landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions in tatters after US pressure,science,BBC,"A landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks. More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. But US President Donald Trump had called the plan a ""green scam"" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a ""huge win"" for Trump. But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a ""plea"" for this not to be repeated. In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year. The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised. The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"". ""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,"" he said. The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting."" ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,"" he added. The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain. The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers. Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position. The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines. Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive. ""There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,"" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations. This means without intervention previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%. The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers. Posting on Truth Social on Thursday night President Trump wrote: ""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers."" With talks now delayed the carefully planned timeline to get the regulations in place for 2028 does not appear feasible. ""A delay in action may require changes to the text of agreement that undermine the planned timeline, and could revert years of work to date,"" said Blánaid Sheeran, an observer to the talks and policy officer at environmental NGO Opportunity Green.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vnl0yxg53o
2025-12-28,Catching the hunters trapping rare songbirds in China,science,BBC,"Silva Gu's eyes dart back and forth across miles of tall grassland, scouring it for signs of life in the darkness. He speaks in less than a whisper as we try to find a spot to hide in the fields. Behind us, the vast metropolis of Beijing has yet to wake. As we wait, we hear only our own breath. And then, as the sky starts to lighten ahead of sunrise, we hear footsteps. The poachers are here. Slim and stealthy, Silva heads out first. We eventually follow with our cameras. Slowly, we tread through a line of trees, into a small clearing. We only spot the bird net when it is a few inches from our faces. Each year, tens of thousands of birds are caught in nets across China for the pet trade, or for meat. The pandemic and a property crisis have turned the economy sluggish - so catching and selling songbirds on the black market is a low-cost and often low-risk way of making a large profit. A pretty songbird, such as a Siberian rubythroat, can often sell for nearly 2,000 yuan (£210; $280), which is more than many farmers earn in a month. ""I want to protect them on this Earth controlled by humans,"" Silva says. Birds, for him, are a passion. ""I often dream. And in my dreams, I'm always flying."" In the skies above us, billions of birds, many so small that they can fit in the palm of your hand, are migrating south for winter. They have taken advantage of the long summer days in Siberia, or Mongolia, feasting on bugs and berries. As the year comes to a close and icy winds bring the first frosts of winter, they are flying to warmer places to nest and feed. This was back in October, when flying through China is the equivalent of rush hour for migratory birds heading to Australia, New Zealand or southern Africa. China is home to 1500-plus bird species, which is about 13% of the global population - more than 800 of those are migratory birds. Four of the nine major routes they follow intersect in China. These are long, often perilous journeys, where the birds navigate through storms and evade predators, while looking for the ideal spot to spend the night. The patch of grassland where we were, on the outskirts of the Chinese capital, is an oasis for small birds - any further and the city skies offer few options to rest among towering rows of concrete. It is also an oasis for the poachers and their ""mist nets"", so thin you can barely see them. The one we nearly walked into was stretched across half the length of the field and propped up with bamboo poles. In the middle, a small finch was desperately trying to free his legs, but the more it moved, the more its claws became tangled. It was a meadow pipit, a protected bird in China, and an important ""indicator species"" - that means if its numbers are thriving, so is its environment. The poacher spotted us and started to run. From a small pouch on his hip, he threw around half a dozen small birds into the air before sprinting deeper into the shrubs. Our cameras caught the moment he was stopped by Silva whose years of experience have taught him how to detain poachers while he calls the police. He stops the poacher from leaving, simply by continuing to block his path. ""At the beginning I had no experience and at that time I was quite afraid,"" he later says. ""But if you really want to do something, those fears will all be forgotten."" The police arrived about 40 minutes later to arrest the poacher. Silva, who in his 30s, does this work for free using his own savings. He has given up on many nights of sleep to set songbirds free, and he has spent the last 10 years persuading the police in Beijing to take this crime seriously. ""Back in 2015, no-one cared,"" he says. So he recruited volunteers who did care and launched a group called the Beijing Migratory Bird Squad. He held public meetings and invited the heads of the local police and forestry bureau. These small and persistent acts of persuasion appear to have worked. The police discovered that catching poachers also led to tracking down other kinds of criminal activity in Beijing. ""We found our goals were partially aligned,"" Silva says, adding the caveat that enforcement is still patchy. Silva's love of birds started in childhood. He grew up in the 1990s in a very different Beijing - grand and imposing, but not the capital of an economic giant. He remembers roaming through the grasslands on the city's edges where he found birds, frogs and snakes. ""But starting from the 2000s, everything changed."" China's booming economy brought millions of rural workers to cities as they sought jobs in factories or in construction. This rapid urbanisation meant grasslands were seen as empty places to build, The change stunned Silva. The grasslands began to shrink, as did the habitats they supported. ""I decided back then to work in conservation and I took this path,"" he says. One of Beijing's biggest bird dealers found out he was being investigated by Silva and retaliated. ""He gathered several of his accomplices who surrounded me and beat me up,"" Silva recalls. He says he went to the police but those responsible were not brought to justice. He has also lost his army of volunteers over the years. This work requires stealth and sleepless nights to stalk poachers in the dark. Silva says few people are willing to take on the difficult - and sometimes dangerous - job. ""I do this full-time,"" he says. ""I made it a project because if you want to solve this big problem, you must devote yourself wholeheartedly. You can't do it part-time."" He says fundraising pays for some of the costs - more than 100,000 yuan, $14,000 a year - but donations have dipped because of the slowing economy. So he has found new ways to hunt the hunters. He studies satellite imagery to find the paths worn away by the poachers through large fields and grasslands. He maps those against the bird's migratory routes and looks for areas where they may stop for the night. The satellite images can even show lines of net traps which can catch hundreds of small birds at night. That's what the mist nets do. They trap a variety of small birds even if the poachers are after prized versions, like the Siberian rubythroat. ""Siberian rubythroats and bluethroats sell for a high price,"" Silva says. ""In big cities like Beijing and Tianjin, those who want to keep birds are now quite wealthy."" Although there are wildlife laws in place, Silva reckons the fines to punish the crime do not outweigh the financial benefits of catching and selling songbirds. Owning a pet bird was - and for some generations in China, still is - a status symbol. This dates back to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China from the mid-17th to early 20th Century. Nobles and elites would build ornate bamboo cages for their birds to display their elegance and wealth. It's a tradition that continues mainly among retired men in their 60s or 70s. Silva says older Chinese people don't realise they are committing a wildlife crime, or understand that so many more birds had to die in a trap so they could buy a caged bird. ""This generation didn't even have enough to eat growing up. Now with a little money, they have inherited the habit and custom of caging birds,"" he says. ""China developed so fast, there was no time to educate people about ecology and once adults values are formed, they're really hard to change. Maybe they can't be changed in a lifetime."" Silva feels alone in this fight. ""Sometimes, I am so tired. I want to find someone, maybe a group of people and we could combine our strength - but right now there is no-one."" On a long low wall alongside the Liangshui river in Beijing, a trader has several small cages with tiny twittering birds. Another man stands outside the nearby vegetable market holding a bird cage shrouded in a black veil. He tells passers-by quietly that his songbird is rare, worth nearly 1900 yuan, or about $270. This is a glimpse of an old Beijing where small unofficial traders have created their own market. The path by the river stretches for several miles and on a sunny weekday morning, there were shoppers browsing everything from vintage jewellery to false teeth, all laid out at makeshift stalls. We were told we would be able to buy a wild songbird in a small park just off the path. It was easy to find. Music was blasting from a speaker under the low trees where a troop of elderly ladies were choreographing a fan dance routine. Nearby several men, all over 50, had gathered with bird cages - some had two or three in their hands. Most were covered in dark cloth. But today there would be no sales because the police had arrived. They were questioning the bird owners and taking names. Defiant, one man said he was taking his caged bird for a walk. This does happen in many Beijing parks, where songbird owners gather with their caged pets to chat and compare notes. This police visit was part of a wider campaign by the Ministry of Public Security that was announced earlier in the year. Wildlife trade is big business. Interpol estimates the illegal portion of the trade to be worth nearly $20bn and, according to Animal Survival group, China is the largest consumer of wildlife products, both illegal and legal. Officials in Beijing have repeatedly denied accusations that the Covid-19 pandemic originated through animal-to-human transmission at a wet market in Wuhan, where wildlife was also being sold. Conservation groups have been pressuring the Chinese government to ban trade in wildlife. This year, Chinese state media described the protection of wild birds as crucial for safeguarding ecosystems vital to human survival. This shift in authorities' attitudes is also why Silva has had success working with the police. That day in the field outside Beijing, Silva managed to keep the poacher at arm's length until the police arrived. The man appeared to be in his 50s and was wearing old construction overalls. Don't move, Silva warned him. The poacher offerered to kneel and apologise, telling Silva that he only came to the field to look at birds. But Silva grabbed his phone, where he found photos and videos of dozens of caged birds. Later, when Silva and the police searched his home, they found them all still there, waiting to be sold. Many of the wildlife poaching rings in China are much bigger. In Dalian earlier this year, the police arrested 13 suspects, and seized more than 12,000 yellow-breasted buntings, a wild bird with the highest protection level in China. Silva worries that despite the renewed efforts to catch poachers, they face few penalties. But he is also encouraged. He has rescued more than 20,000 birds on site for the past 10 years and disrupted the nets of countless poachers. ""I think there's hope,"" he says, pinning his on a generational change - when more young people will understand and appreciate China's rare songbirds and the need to protect them. Until then, he says, he will keep at it himself: ""This is my ideal. If you have this ideal, you must persist. You can't not."" And so each night during the annual migration, he will patrol the fields of Beijing in the hope that he can bring back the dulcet tones of songbirds to the city's skies -  he wants his city to sound like it did in his childhood.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxw7593x9zo

2025-10-19,From Hollywood to horticulture: Cate Blanchett on a mission to save seeds,science,BBC,"She's a Hollywood A-lister, with a mantelpiece groaning under the weight of awards. But Cate Blanchett has taken an unexpected diversion from her day job - to immerse herself in the world of the humble seed. Her eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia. ""It's quite a brutal looking seed pod that only releases its seed in extremely high temperatures,"" she tells us. ""It does look like a cross between a mallet and a toilet brush. So they're not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular."" We meet her at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary. ""Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,"" she says. ""And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here… and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring."" The MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world. The seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C. The conservation project was opened by The King  - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He's taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett. In the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost. ""I know  how  absolutely  critical  it all is, and  the  destruction  of  rainforests,  the  extinction  of  endless  species,  which  have  very  likely  remarkable  properties,"" he tells the podcast. When the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction. But 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat. ""We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,"" explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who's been showing Cate Blanchett the team's work. ""We're just providing a safe space for them until we can get them back out into a habitat where they can thrive and survive."" This includes projects like one taking place on the South Downs. A special mix of seeds from the MSB are being sown to help restore the rare chalk grasslands there. And this restoration work is being repeated around the world. ""We've been to every kind of habitat, from sea level to about 5,000m, and from pole to pole - literally,"" explained Dr Breman. ""And we're involved in restoring tropical forest, dry deciduous forest, grassland, steppe - you name it - we're trying to help people put those plants back in place."" The seed bank also helped to restore plants after intense wildfires swept across Australia in 2019. Cate Blanchett says this meant a lot to her. ""There are almost 9,000 species of Australian plant that are stored [at the MSB].  And we know that bushfires are getting increasingly more intense. And it's sad to say - but knowing that insurance policy exists, is of great solace to me."" Working as an ambassador for Wakehurst has meant that the actor has had a chance to get hands on with the seeds. ""Have I got dirt under my fingernails? Well, I'm trying to turn my brown thumbs green,"" she laughs. ""You know, living in Sussex, you can't not but become a passionate gardener. So I've had a lot of questions about how one stores seeds as a lay person, and I've learned a lot about that. My seed management has definitely, definitely improved."" And after spending so much time with the researchers at the MSB, is she at all tempted to swap the film set for the lab? ""I wish I had the skill - maybe I could play a scientist,"" she laughs. Cate Blanchett describes the seed bank as the UK's best kept secret - and believes that over the next 25 years its work will continue to grow in importance. ""You often think, where are the good news stories? And we're actually sitting inside one,"" she tells us. ""You come here, you visit the seed bank, you walk through such a biodiverse landscape, and you leave uplifted. You know change is possible and it's happening.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7ekl4yl8o
2025-12-28,Three killed in Sweden as major storm sweeps across Nordic countries,science,BBC,"A third person has died in Sweden after a powerful winter storm swept across Nordic countries, causing travel disruption and power outages. Sweden's meteorological agency issued alerts for strong winds for large parts of the northern half of the country as Storm Johannes hit. One man in his 50s died after being struck by a tree at the Kungsberget ski resort in the country's south, local media and police reported. Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working. Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries. Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm. In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported. Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions. In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported. Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK. In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle. Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported. The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said.

2025-12-15,Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt,science,BBC,"On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as ""one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen"". Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project. ""We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,"" he says. ""Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas."" The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel ""Dig, baby, dig"" slogan. ""Green, baby, green,"" said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy. However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of ""fanaticism"" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model. The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. ""We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,"" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. ""Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment."" Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an ""unknown event"" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads. Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition. ""It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy,"" he says. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. ""How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?"" he asks. The answer, he added, is ""with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year"". The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as ""a crucial source of stability"". Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. She also sees storage as an issue. ""While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,"" she says. ""We need to foster storage installation."" Spain's political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months. A right-wing government, which polls suggest would be the likely outcome, would almost certainly place less emphasis on renewables and advocate a partial return to more traditional energy sources. But in the meantime, Spain's renewable transition continues. And for Figueruelas, in Aragón, that means not just cheap, clean energy, but investment. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating. ""These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the construction sector, hostelry,"" says local man Manuel Martín. ""And the energy is free – it just depends on the sun and the wind.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn410nll79po
2025-12-28,Young Science Writer of the Year: How 'super shoes' transformed running,science,BBC,", young British science writer Hasset Kifle from Stoke on Trent used her personal experience as a competitive runner as her starting point for her article about the impact of 'technological doping', in the form of super shoes, on elite sport. The world is moving forward at an unimaginable rate and technology is leading this bullet train into the unknown. In the world of sport, technological advancements have raised the question: How far is too far? Running is an integral measurement of mankind's physical and mental capabilities. It is a sport that thrives on competition: athlete vs athlete and athlete vs time. More recently, it has become a playground for world-leading brands. Technology doping, or technological doping, are terms coined to describe the competitive advantage gained by using high-tech sports equipment. It has caused notable perspective shift on what it means to be an athlete. The top 10 fastest marathons by men and women were all run within the last seven years (with the exception of Paula Radcliffe in 2003). Could part of the reason be shoes? Shoes so advanced they have been nicknamed ""super shoes"". Testing - in the lab and on the world stage - has provided evidence of the enhancements of an athlete's performance that stretches beyond physiological capabilities. Super shoes consist of four main features: the midsole foam; the curved carbon-fibre plate; the stack height and the breathable upper. These components work in synergy to produce a lightweight, highly cushioned and flexible shoe to maximise the energy returned to the athlete to propel them forward, while minimising the amount of energy exerted by the athlete themselves. They were popularised in 2016, when Nike released the Nike Vaporfly, shoes that were showcased when they were worn by the top three male finishers in the Rio Olympic men's marathon. - showed that these shoes could reduce the energetic cost of running by 4%, compared with established marathon racing shoes. That translates to a desired pace being sustained for longer, eventually resulting in a faster finishing time. These shoes have also caused controversy, because of the number of records broken by athletes wearing them. To combat this, in 2020, World Athletics - the international governing body for the sport - implemented regulations on the features that super shoes could have. Those rules state that the maximum stack height must not exceed 40mm and that the shoes must have no more than one carbon plate. Critics have also raised concerns that today's athletes do not meet the standards of athletes in the past, precisely because technology has provided them with such an advantage. . Arguably, this raises the question: who is the major competitor? Athletes or the brands producing these innovative technologies. There could also be psychological effects associated with super shoes. If athletes believe they must wear them to run a faster time, they could become more reliant on the technology. At the heart of it all running is the ultimate test of fitness - both through muscular strength in the short sprints to cardiovascular strength and endurance in the marathon. It is a battle between the mind and the body that begins before the starting gun even goes off. As someone who has competed in various distances ranging from the 300m to the 5k, and trained with athletes who wear super shoes, it is important for me to have the ability to progress in the sport but also for the sport to progress with me. If that comes at the loss of the credibility of the sport, it seems that the world of sport has an important choice to make.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4dvl1jz4wo
