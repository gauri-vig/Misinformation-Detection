Read our The City regulator is paving the way for shoppers to make larger , moving beyond the current £100 transaction limit for physical cards. (FCA), proposed removing the limit entirely and now has announced plans set for next year, whereby banks and payment providers with robust fraud controls will gain autonomy to establish their own payment thresholds. It’s worth noting that the rules apply only to physical cards - payments through digital devices such as phones have no limit as they have greater security built in, such as PINs or face recognition. These regulatory changes are scheduled to commence on March 19, though individual firms will decide when to adopt the flexibility. Firms that go ahead with the changes will need to communicate them clearly to their customers, the regulator said. The aim is to allow firms to better respond to changing consumer demands, inflation and new technology. Firms are also being encouraged to let customers set their own limit, or turn contactless off altogether, as many high street banks already do. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, has said: “We‘re seeing smarter payment technology and more well-established fraud controls, so it’s the right time to let firms tailor contactless payments to fit their customers’ needs and drive innovation. While we wouldn’t expect to see immediate changes to limits by firms, they would have the flexibility to make payments more convenient for customers. “People are still protected; even with contactless, firms will refund your money if your card is used fraudulently.” Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. The popularity of contactless payments has surged over the years, with contactless card transactions limits having previously been increased in a series of steps. According to consumer spending data from Barclays, 94.6 per cent of eligible in-store card transactions were contactless in 2024. Last year, there were 10 times as many contactless transactions per month than there were in 2015, according to Barclays. As well as a £100 limit for a single contactless card transaction, there is also a cumulative total of £300 in contactless transactions, or no more than five consecutive contactless transactions, since the last application of “strong customer authentication” to verify a payment was made. Under the rule change, firms will also have the flexibility to consider changing the cumulative contactless approach if they want to. The FCA believes the option of greater flexibilities will incentivise firms to step up their fraud prevention, giving consumers greater protection. Existing protections will remain in place, meaning consumers must be reimbursed in unauthorised fraud cases, such as if their card is lost or stolen. The review of the contactless card limit was one of around 50 measures the regulator outlined in a letter to Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer in January to help support economic growth. The proposals were out for consultation until October 15. The regulator has previously said that, based on industry feedback, it anticipated most firms would continue to implement the £100 limit for the time being. Mr Geale, added: “Contactless is people’s favoured way to pay. We want to make sure our rules provide flexibility for the future, and choice for both firms and consumers.” Kate Nicholls, chairwoman of UKHospitality, said: “Making life easier for consumers is a positive for any hospitality and high street business, and I’m pleased the FCA is bringing forward this change. “Contactless has increasingly become the preferred payment method of choice for many people and lifting the limit can mean quicker and easier experiences for consumers. While many people still prefer to use cash or chip and Pin, this change adds much-needed flexibility for providers and consumers.” Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments and innovation at UK Finance, said: “We welcome the FCA’s move to give banks and payment providers greater flexibility over contactless limits in the future. “Contactless is a very popular and secure way to pay. “While we do not expect to see any immediate change to the £100 contactless limit, any changes made in the future will be done carefully and ensure strong security and fraud controls remain in place.”",business,The Independent

Under the terms of the offer, IPF shareholders will receive 235 pence in cash for each share, valuing the provider of credit products and insurance services at around £543 million. IPF shares closed at 220.00p on Wednesday. The offer represents a premium of around 31% to IPF’s closing share price of 179.2 pence on July 29, the last trading day before the company entered an offer period. The agreed offer follows a series of approaches from BasePoint earlier this year. In September, IPF said it had received an improved indicative proposal of 235p per share, raised from an initial 220p approach made in July, and indicated at the time that its board would be minded to recommend the offer if a firm bid were made. IPF’s board has unanimously recommended the offer, and completion of the acquisition is subject to shareholder approval. Chairman Stuart Sinclair said: “Whilst the board continues to believe in the strategy and long-term prospects of IPF on a standalone basis, we recognise that the acquisition allows IPF shareholders to monetise their entire investment for cash at a fair price. “We believe that the business will benefit from BasePoint’s ownership and its commitment to fulfil IPF’s purpose of building a better world through financial inclusion.” Elsewhere, Everyman Media shares closed flat after chief executive Alex Scrimgeour stepped down with immediate effect, as analysts said “time had run out” for the boss after a profit warning and the resignation of the finance director earlier this month. Mr Scrimgeour’s departure follows finance director Will Worsdell’s resignation two weeks ago. He is leaving at the end of March. The London-based premium cinema chain has appointed Farah Golant, currently non-executive director, as the interim chief executive. “Farah has extensive experience across the global creative, entertainment and media industries, and a track record of accelerating growth and cultivating high performance, results-oriented organisations,” said Philip Jacobson, the company’s non-executive chairman. “Everyman has now lost both its chief executive and its finance director over the past fortnight,” said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. “That’s unfortunate timing and means the pressure is on to find a new leadership team fast.” “The share price fell by 76% during his tenure and time had run out,” he added. Mr Scrimgeour has stepped down after Everyman’s profit warning earlier this month, where it said it was “operating in a challenging economic environment” with recent UK box office performance “weaker than anticipated”. “It’s fair to say that 2025 wasn’t a golden year for new film releases, making matters worse for Everyman. Its recent profit warning was blamed on a weak fourth quarter film state, and the release schedule for the next few months doesn’t instil much optimism,” said Mr Coatsworth.

Read our have been urged to spend Boxing Day using up Christmas dinner leftovers amid figures suggesting food waste will cost a family of four an average of £1,000 this year. Households are set to throw away around 85,000 tonnes of edible Christmas food this festive season alone, according to estimates from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) and the Office for National Statistics. are generated by UK homes from wasted consumable food and drink each year, Throughout the year, almost 40% of food waste happens because it is not used in time – either because people think the product smells or looks off or it is past its date label, a study for the organisation found. Each year, UK households threw out 480,000 tonnes of potatoes – or 41% of all potatoes bought. Wrap has urged households to store potatoes – and all other uncut fruit and vegetables except for onions, bananas and whole pineapples – in the fridge at 5C or below. It also reminded consumers that food past its ‘best before’ date is safe to eat for days, months or even years afterwards, and people should use their own judgment to decide if their food is edible. However, ‘use by’ labels refer to safety, and food should not be eaten past this date. Wrap chief executive Catherine David said: “A third of all the food we grow is wasted, and it’s so noticeable at Christmas, a time when we want to put on a feast, but at the same time household budgets are particularly stretched. “We can make our cash go further, and protect our planet’s precious resources, this Christmas by ensuring we make the most of our leftovers and follow Love Food Hate Waste’s simple tips and tricks to ensure we love our food, hate our waste, and make sure as much food as possible goes onto people’s plates and into their tummies.” said: “Over half of food waste happens in our homes so reheating extra roasties and making the traditional turkey curry can save money and cut carbon emissions. “Together with the Government’s £13.5 million grants to food charities to redistribute 19,000 tonnes of surplus food from farms, small changes can make the Christmas food shop go further and end up in the freezer not the food waste caddy.” The focus on food waste comes as appliance brands launch built-in AI tools to help consumers use up the contents of their fridges and freezers. Hisense’s ConnectLife app now features Dish Designer, which uses AI to create customised recipes from the contents of its fridges and freezers – a similar feature to Samsung’s Bespoke AI fridge freezers which have touchscreen displays that generate recipes, largely by scanning what is inside the fridge. Hisense’s Dish Designer can personalise recipes depending on households’ dietary requirements, and members can add products in the fridge and cupboards to an ‘inventory’, which is used to generate recipes. Hisense said approximately 30,000 recipes had been generated in total across since Dish Designer launched in May. Of these, around 12,000 recipes were generated in the UK.

Read our has been fined 256 million euros (£224 million) by Italy’s competition watchdog for allegedly using an “abusive strategy” to hinder third-party travel agencies. The regulator claimed in its ruling that the low-cost airline deliberately made it difficult for agencies to buy flights on its website, between April 2023 and at least April this year. The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) said: “Following a complex investigation, the authority found that Ryanair put in place an elaborate strategy affecting the ability of online and traditional travel agencies to purchase Ryanair flights on ryanair.com. “In particular, the company’s strategy blocked, hindered or made such purchases more difficult… when combined with flights operated by other carriers and/or other tourism and insurance services.” “These practices compromised the ability of agencies to purchase Ryanair flights and combine them with flights from other airlines and/or additional travel services, thereby reducing direct and indirect competition between agencies,” it added. Ryanair said it would appeal the ruling and the fine, which it said was “unjustly levied”. The Dublin-based carrier said: “Ryanair has campaigned for many years to offer consumers the lowest fares by booking directly on the ryanair.com website. “This direct distribution model was ruled to ‘undoubtedly benefit consumers’ by the Court, as recently as Jan 2024.” Ryanair’s long-standing chief executive, Michael O’Leary, branded the ruling “legally unsound”. He said: “This AGCM ruling is an affront to the precedent Milan court ruling, and also an affront to consumer protection and competition law. – and in many other markets across – by always offering the lowest air fares in every single market in which we operate. “This legally baseless AGCM Ruling, and its absurd 256 million euro fine, undermines consumer protection and competition law, and it will be overturned on appeal.” It comes after Italy fined Ryanair 3 million euros (£2.6 million) in 2019 for its policy of charging passengers for cabin baggage, but the penalty was later overturned by an administrative court. Online travel agency eDreams Odigeo welcomed the ruling against Ryanair and called for a wider investigation across the industry, claiming it is “not isolated”. Guillaume Teissonniere, general counsel at the travel agency, said the ruling “details a calculated plot orchestrated not only to abuse market dominance but also to actively deceive financial markets about the self-inflicted consequences”. He added: “Crucially, this is not an isolated incident; it is the latest in a mounting series of binding decisions across Europe that Ryanair has consistently chosen to ignore. “This corporate culture of complete disregard for the law must end. “We therefore call on authorities across Europe to follow the AGCM’s lead and intervene immediately.”",business,The Independent

Paramount’s offer values Warner Bros at 108.4 billion dollars (£81.3 billion) including debts, trumping Netflix’s 27.75 dollars (£20.81) per share offer, which values Warner Bros at 72 billion dollars (£54 billion), or 82.7 billion dollars (£62 billion) including debts. US streaming giant Netflix agreed to buy the Warner Bros Discovery film and TV studios business, whereas Paramount has bid for the whole of Warner Bros. Mr Trump had already warned the Netflix takeover of Warner Bros “could be a problem” because of its combined market share, confirming he would be involved in the decision about whether the US federal government should approve the deal. Paramount had said in its appeal to win over Warner Bros shareholders that its offer would be more likely to pass regulatory scrutiny. Mr Kushner’s decision to pull his firm’s financial backing is seen as taking away a possible advantage for Paramount to secure Mr Trump’s approval for its rival bid.

https://www.independent.co.uk/money/investing-stocks-shares-isa-christmas-santa-rally-b2887893.html,What is the Santa Rally and how do investors make money from it?,2025-12-19T15:54:31.000Z,"Knowing where the stock market is going next for certain would be a superpower that puts wealth in the palm of your hand. While not even Warren Buffett would claim to have such an ability, there are many factors to draw on which offer clues all consistently rise over long timeframes of multiple years. There are short-run falls along the way, but over the course of five years in most cases, and certainly over ten years, the leading markets such as the United States’ and United Kingdom’s have always made their way higher. The so-called Santa Rally is also an example which provides a good steer on how the stock market could move. As the name suggests, it occurs close to Christmas. To be precise, the Santa Rally is a rise in the stock market that often happens across the last five days of trading in December and the first two in January. , which is the top stock market index for the US, has risen by 1.3 per cent on average across just these seven days since 1960. Sometimes it is more and sometime less. In fact, it is crucial to note that it only rises in around four out of five years (79 per cent). A return of that size in seven days is very attractive, given it would take months to earn 1.3 per cent from cash savings. The other times (21 per cent) the Santa Rally has not occurred, and stock markets have fallen across these days. So, it is far a guarantee. There is significant debate over why the Santa Rally happens so often. A mixture of practical reasons and human nature is believed to be at play. One theory is that at the end of the year, analysts who forecast stock prices begin to revise predictions for the year ahead, and often raise their expected numbers. This feeds into investors’ decisions making. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Next, there are tax obligations. Many investors sell shares as the year end approaches and then re-enter positions at the start of a new year, according to their own particular tax positions and the performance of their investments. There can also be some “balancing of the books” towards the year end where fund managers lock in profitable positions, by selling, to make their annual performance look as good as possible - and then buy back in as the year ticks over. Another factor is reduced trading volume as traders and fund managers take time off over the Christmas period. This means less is moving around, and so prices can be pushed higher, or lower, more easily. Expectations and psychology likely play a role too. The fact that the Santa Rally has consistently occurred over many decades means people expect it to happen, and therefore buy into the market: it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree. On the psychological side, it is possible that the optimism that many people experience as a new year begins filters through into their financial decisions, so they are more inclined to buy than sell around this time. One other thing that may play a role is January as a whole often being a strong month for the stock market. The S&P 500 has risen 73 per cent of the time in January since 1950 and the has been up 64 per cent of the time. Investors therefore try to take advantage of this by buying-in as soon as the month begins, or even slightly before. It is relatively straightforward to make money from the Santa Rally - on the years it occurs. As mentioned though, it is by no means certain to happen in any given year, and the stock market could also fall in this period. is a long-term endeavour and trying to time when to buy and sell perfectly is extremely difficult. The best way to approach the Santa Rally is to view it as a potentially nice bonus as part of a long-held, diversified investment portfolio. That said, the simplest way to take advantage of the Santa Rally is to buy a stock market tracker . Another option is a FTSE 100 ETF or passive tracker fund, given the rise often occurs in the UK stock market as well. Either one will give you exposure to all the companies in the chosen index so the value of your investment will rise, or fall, in line with the market. Both S&P 500 and FTSE 100 trackers are available via all the major UK investment platforms from providers including BlackRock’s iShares, Vanguard, Legal and General and many others.",business,The Independent

In part as a result of this tough-to-shift inflation, the Bank of England (BoE)’s higher than hoped for, though they are now are one of the primary ways the BoE looks to control inflation, they are often linked to each other, and each one can have knock-on effects on several areas for people in the UK. The BoE doesn’t only consider inflation: economic growth, wages, employment rates and plenty of other factors in the geopolitical landscape can come into play.

Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation is usually the figure used as the headline number - that’s at 3.2 per cent now. But it’s important to also look at the CPI data which includes costs for running households (CPIH), and this was 3.5 per cent for last month. CPIH is the preferred metric for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), who are responsible for collecting and releasing the data. Rising food and drink prices for much of this year and wage growth not slowing to comfortable levels have been problems hampering further rate cuts this year. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. But food prices did drop in November, as did wage growth, while unemployment rates rose and the economy contracted 0.1 per cent - all this means interest rates should drop this time around. are generally pleased when interest rates come down, and most people are happy when there’s not too much inflation. But as both of those have been high recently, repaying has been more expensive over the past two years unless you were locked into a lower-rate deal that didn’t need renewing. Rates have come down three times this year already, 0.25 percentage points each time, and there are plenty of deals on the market at sub-four per cent interest rates as lenders battle for business and Depending on your circumstances and type of mortgage, though, you may have a significantly higher rate than that - some 100 per cent , for example, start from 5.99 per cent. Mortgage deals also tend to be based on swap rates - future expectations of interest rates - rather than the bank rate itself, which is why lenders can sometimes price them lower than the current interest rate, or move higher in anticipation of no future cuts. Higher inflation, then, won’t immediately make your mortgage repayments more expensive - but it could reduce the chances of future interest rate cuts. (and any other loans) are cheaper to pay off when the interest rate goes down, the opposite is true for your Banks price their products from the bank rate; therefore, when as it comes down, we now see most of the best easy access paying around 4.4-4.5 per cent, when at the start of 2025 there was lots of competition in the 5 to 5.5 per cent range. to earn interest, but also to ensure your cash doesn’t see its buying power eroded because of inflation. If inflation runs at an average of 3.0 per cent this year and next, then £100 in a bank account will only be effectively worth a little over £94 by the end of 2026. Utilising interest rates, therefore, helps protect your overall cash value - and beyond that, where possible, such as in an individual account (ISA) or pension, as this has a much higher chance of beating inflation and giving better returns over a number of years.",business,The Independent

Read our Retail sales dipped unexpectedly last month as cautious shoppers prevailed and Black Friday discounts failed to boost spending in the run-up to Christmas, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the total volume of retail sales was estimated to have fallen by 0.1 per cent in November. This followed a 0.9 per cent drop in October, and was a surprise decline as most analysts had been expecting a 0.4 per cent increase for the month. Supermarket sales fell in November for the fourth month in a row, by 0.5 per cent, with retailers reporting a lower number of shoppers coming to stores. The ONS also said the effect of Black Friday – with discounts typically stretching well beyond the specific end-of-November date – appeared to be slightly weaker this year than usual. It was a disappointing month for non-store retailers – a cohort that consists primarily of online shops, but also includes outlets like street stalls and markets – with sales dropping by 2.9 per cent. In particular, online jewellers noted reduced demand following a period of stronger interest in gold. ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach said: “This year, November’s Black Friday discounts did not boost sales as much as in some recent years, meaning that once we adjust for usual seasonality, our headline figures fell a little on the month. “Meanwhile, our separate household survey showed that although some people said they were planning to do more shopping this Black Friday than last, almost twice as many said they were planning to do less.” Nevertheless, the data showed that department stores’ sales volumes jumped by 2.3 per cent in November, which some retailers said was down to a longer period of Black Friday discounting. The volume of sales for clothes and shoe shops also rose by 1.7 per cent, and for household goods retailers by 1.8 per cent. Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail for , said a second month of declining sales will be a “big disappointment for retailers, particularly with Black Friday and early Christmas shopping captured in these figures”. “It could be that some consumers opted to delay spending decisions until after the , but the rise in volumes across department stores, clothing and footwear and household goods suggests that the start of the discounting period could have enticed consumers into purchases at the end of the month,” he said. He added that the “bigger picture of retail in 2025 showed a prolonged pressure from weak consumer confidence and challenging economic conditions”. Nicholas Found, head of commercial content at Retail Economics, said the cost of living remained a “dominant concern for households”, explaining that “retailers are now operating in an environment where wins increasingly come at a competitor’s expense”. “The real test for retailers is in the run-up to Christmas,” he added. Erin Brookes, European retail and consumer lead for Alvarez & Marsal, agreed that the battle between retailers to attract shoppers in December will be fierce. She said: “As the golden quarter enters its final stretch, retailers will be pulling every lever to convert last-minute demand, as well as getting into clearance for categories that have not shifted sufficiently. “Competition will be intense for each pound of discretionary spend as they race to the finish line of the festive trading period.”",business,The Independent

Read our At Home has ended its three-month search for a new boss with the appointment of former managing director James Bailey to the top post. Mr Bailey, who will take up the role on March 30, replaces Lyssa McGowan after she quit abruptly in September amid profit warnings and sliding sales, ending a three-year tenure at the helm. Chairman Ian Burke took the helm on an interim basis after she left, but will revert back to become non-executive chairman when Mr Bailey joins next spring. Mr Bailey was previously managing director of Waitrose for more than five years until he left in August, which saw him steer the upmarket grocery chain through the pandemic and the following spike in food price inflation. Before Waitrose, he held a raft of senior roles during a 20-year career at supermarket giant Sainsbury’s, including grocery buying director. His appointment comes as Pets At Home battles to turn around its fortunes after a series of profit warnings. Half-year results in November revealed profits tumbled by more than a third, with underlying earnings at the retail business plummeting 84% and offsetting a resilient performance at the vet chain. Mr Burke warned last month that “urgent and necessary” measures were needed to address the retail division’s woes, with cost-cutting a key part of its revival plan as he revealed aims to reduce overheads by around £20 million. Mr Burke said: “Following an extensive search process, the board believes James’s experience aligns well with the group’s ambitions for the coming years. “His strong retail leadership skills will support the ongoing focus on improving Pets At Home’s retail business, with significant operational and commercial experience leading both stores and online operations.” Mr Bailey said Pets At Home is “a business I’ve admired for a long time and one I believe has a very bright future”. He will be paid a salary of £639,770, plus pension and benefits, with the potential for an annual bonus of up to 170% of salary.

Read our has been offered “very little Christmas cheer” after official figures showed higher-than-forecast government borrowing for November. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing stood at £11.7 billion last month, £1.9 billion less than in November last year and the lowest November level for four years thanks to a sharp fall in debt interest payments. But the figure was more than the £10 billion expected by most economists and the £8.6 billion forecast in March by the UK’s independent fiscal watchdog, the The OBR’s monthly forecasts from the on November 26 are not available until mid-January, according to the Borrowing for the eight months of the financial year so far was higher than expected, at £132.3 billion – £10 billion more than the same period a year ago and £16.8 billion above the OBR forecast in March. This was partly due to an extra £1.8 billion of spending on winter fuel payments after the Government’s U-turn on its decision to severely restrict payments, instead opting to give the payout to all pensioners except those earning above £35,000 a year. This helped drive an upward revision to borrowing for the seven months to October by £3.9 billion. Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was “very little Christmas cheer for the Chancellor” in the latest figures. He added that the Chancellor’s “fiscal plans rest on shaky foundations”, with the data showing that Britain’s public finances “remain weak” despite a lower out-turn for November. The figure was pushed lower thanks to falling debt interest payments on borrowing, down by £200 million year-on-year to £3.4 billion and the lowest November level for six years. The data for last month was also helped by higher tax receipts, as April’s increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) saw compulsory social contributions lift £3 billion to £17 billion in November. Public sector net debt, including the Bank of England, reached £2.93 trillion at the end of November, which is around 95.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 0.3 percentage points more than a year ago. It remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s. Mr Jordan-Doak said: “Ms Reeves has staked much fiscal credibility on chunky tax increases in the back end of the forecast period. But we think today’s figures further illustrate the shaky foundations of that gamble. “Revenues continue to underperform, and the smorgasbord approach of tax increases relies on distortionary tax increases with uncertain yields. “We also have serious doubts about the Government’s ability to follow through on the raft of spending cuts announced in the Budget.” Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said the debt interest payments underscored the need to bring borrowing down. He said: “£1 in every £10 we spend goes on debt interest – money that could otherwise be invested in public services. “That is why last month the Chancellor set out a Budget that delivers on our pledge to cut debt and borrowing.” said borrowing for the year to date was “the highest on record outside of the pandemic”. “Yet at the Budget, Labour chose even more reckless spending, piling up ever higher debt,” he said. Martin Beck at WPI Strategy said “confidence remains the missing ingredient”. “A clear and credible pro-growth strategy from the Government – and an end to the pervasive gloom surrounding the UK economy – may matter just as much for the public finances as the fine print of future tax and spending plans,” he said.",business,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/e2e-100/factory-built-future-british-construction-b2862852.html,The factory-built future of British construction,2025-11-12T09:02:04.000Z,"The introduction of the industrial production line in car manufacturing, pioneered by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, revolutionised the automotive industry and global manufacturing practices. But there is one sector that has—remarkably—failed to embrace the full potential of industrialised models of production: construction. Just look at housebuilding—while advanced manufacturing is now utilising robots and AI, in many ways homes are still being built as they were 100 years ago: with contractors laying bricks in muddy fields. But technologies to modernise construction do exist. At Reds10 we have been pioneering them for more than a decade now, developing highly sustainable, innovative, high-quality modular buildings offsite in our dedicated factories in Driffield, East Yorkshire, for the public sector. These include amazing homes for the military, school buildings and facilities for the Ministry of Justice and the NHS. However, in the UK this process, known as Modern Methods of Construction or MMC, has yet to enter the mainstream. This is at least in part due to the nature of our housebuilding market, dominated as it is by a small number of large housebuilders, who have a near monopoly over the market and therefore little incentive to drive forward innovation. In the UK modular construction has also suffered from a perception problem — a hangover from poorly constructed post-war prefabricated buildings. This perception is grossly outdated: a bit like comparing a Morris Marina with a Tesla. Take, for example, our award-winning Imjin Barracks project, a highly sustainable three-storey building that provides the UK’s defence personnel with modern, comfortable and technologically advanced accommodation. Built offsite through our advanced construction techniques, Imjin Barracks, like all the projects Reds10 delivers, is unrecognisable from the much-maligned ‘prefabs’ of yesteryear and is indistinguishable from buildings built through traditional construction techniques. But it is not just residential developments that can benefit from industrialised construction techniques. Reds10 has been working with the government’s multibillion-pound New Hospital Programme (NHP) to develop a prototype for the new in-patient bedroom that will be delivered in the first wave of state-of-the-art hospitals that will be built over the next five years. The full-scale model room, complete with ensuite and corridor, is now undergoing an incredibly rigorous process of clinical review and testing to ensure it is fully optimised for clinical use —and crucially—before designs are locked and replicated thousands of times (the bedroom alone will be replicated over 3,000 times in just the first wave of hospitals). This means any technical issues can be resolved now, before 11 new hospitals are built simultaneously, ensuring the late‑stage rework that has plagued complex healthcare builds and driven up costs can be avoided. The advantages of industrialising construction in this way are myriad. Our factory production process is optimised for efficiency using repeatable processes and components, modern manufacturing tools, and advanced technologies that would be impractical on a construction site. The efficiency of factory construction means project delivery timescales can be drastically reduced by up to 50%. Industrialised construction also greatly improves quality, with fewer post-construction snagging issues. Buildings are more airtight, providing greater energy efficiency without additional cost. And with around 90% of the construction completed in the factory, there is also far less disruption to local communities from works on site. The efficiency of MMC also means that we can build projects with less labour. Across our pipeline we use around 30% less labour than would be required by traditional construction techniques, which is a real plus given the severe skills shortage that has long afflicted the industry. If construction as a whole industrialised in this way, the skills gap would be bridged. In our factory settings we also employ our own workforce, investing in their skills and career development and supporting young people into apprenticeships and training opportunities. By other industry standards this may seem unremarkable, but in construction employing your own workforce (rather than managing an ever-growing chain of smaller sub-contractors) is increasingly rare. Ultimately, MMC and the benefits it brings has huge potential to transform the construction industry, providing better quality, more efficiency, greater cost reductions, higher productivity, and improved sustainability. Industrialising construction in the way Reds10 is pioneering would bring the industry into the 21st century and help deliver the modern homes and infrastructure the country needs.

As always, this year’s E2E Profit 100 list really does make fantastic reading. During one of the UK’s most challenging trading periods since records began – post-pandemic, post-Brexit and during a cost-of-living crisis when every business is facing continually increasing costs, to see these businesses not simply surviving but positively thriving proves that success on this scale is still possible and can be achieved, even when the media headlines suggest the very opposite. Every single business that has made the Profit 100 list is inspirational. Despite spanning diverse industries, each and every business will share one key thing in common; the ability to take a risk and consistently aim higher than others. In the simplest of terms, no one sets out to run a business with the hope it might break even. May just cover its costs. That the products or services it produces are average. No, it is the exact opposite. Every single start up began with a great idea, a hunger to make it work and a fire in their belly. Every successful business began with a dream that prevented sleep and created such a strong desire to take action that resistance was futile. And of course, we all know that when it comes to running a business, generating a profit isn’t optional, it’s essential. While the principle of profit may be a relatively simple maths equation – more money in than money out – the fact is, profit remains the lifeblood of every business endeavour. Profit not only enables businesses to weather unpredictable storms, but it also enables you to invest for the future. Profit to play with means you can be creative and courageous. After all, this is how businesses succeed. Whether you want to compete regionally, nationally or on a global stage, businesses have to grow and evolve. In the UK, we have a rich history of innovation and creativity – it runs through our DNA. From engineering and technology to design and aerospace, this great nation has long been a home for entrepreneurialism – both creating them and nurturing them. We have long been world leaders in industry and yet I have to ask, is that still the case? And if not, why not? Have we become lazy and complacent? Or are we lacking the conditions in which entrepreneurialism can take root and grow? As a nation, we must create the right environment to encourage both investment and growth, it can’t be left to entrepreneurs to dig deeper and deeper. But how? Well, first, our government needs to think differently in order to support, nurture and champion those who strive to innovate and inspire others. How can those in parliament incentivise a nationwide growth mindset to drive success and investment in the future? What can be done to actively encourage a competitive mindset and a desire to win, instead of success being regarded as a dirty word? Those included in the E2E Profit 100 have embraced this mindset with gusto. They have harnessed courage and dared to take a risk, to be different and to make a difference. They are fully committed to the pursuit of reward, and in doing so, it is only right that we all congratulate them. But, we must go further than congratulations, we should celebrate, revere and rejoice in their success because they are leading the way. Now is the time to do things differently. For all of us.

This will help your average share cost even out over time, so you don’t need to worry about events outside your control. With pound cost averaging, you’re not trying to time the market, or predict when share prices will rise or fall. Investing the same amount regularly means you automatically buy more when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. Over time, this can reduce your average cost per share. Here’s an example. Say, you decide to invest £200 every month. The first month, you might get 20 shares at £10 each. The next month, if the price drops to £5, you’ll get 40 shares. So, you end up with 60 shares for £400, meaning an average cost of £6.67 per share. Sarah Coles, personal finance expert at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “If you put in one lump sum, there’s a risk you pick a bad time, just before the market falls. “However, if you invest monthly, some of your money will go in when markets are rising, and some will go in when they have fallen, so your money goes further. That way, when they recover again, you benefit from those gains.” Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. have been choppy over the past couple of years. Rising inflation and changing interest rate expectations have kept investors nervous, while geopolitical tensions and shifting US trade policies have added to the uncertainty. At the same time, high valuations in fast-growing areas like tech and AI have made prices more sensitive to earnings news and headlines. Together, these factors have led to frequent market ups and downs rather than a smooth rise. Jason Hollands, managing director of BestInvest, says: “One of the biggest things that deters people from investing is the fear of getting the timing wrong. The thought of ploughing a hard-earned lump sum of money into the stock market only to subsequently see a subsequent dramatic slide in share prices, can be a real deterrent to acting at all. “Pound cost averaging, which essentially means investing regularly, is a great way to overcome these fears.” Pound cost averaging naturally happens with workplace pension contributions because you’re investing the same amount on a regular schedule – usually every month when you’re paid. To set up pound cost averaging for a and shares ISA, start by choosing an ISA provider with low fees and simple automated investing. Everyone has a £20,000 ISA contribution limit each year – split monthly, this means a maximum monthly contribution of £1666.67. In practice, most people can’t afford to invest this amount each month – but even £100 or so is worthwhile. You can set up a direct debit for your chosen amount. You’ll need to decide which fund(s) you want to invest in and arrange for your ISA provider to invest your money into your chosen investment. One major benefit of pound cost averaging is accessibility. Many people believe investing requires a large pot of money – but drip-feeding cash proves otherwise. For new investors, pound cost averaging lowers the psychological barrier to entry as you don’t need to pick the perfect moment or gather a sizeable lump sum. “Pound cost averaging keeps you going steadily, through both the good times when optimism abound but share prices might be expensive, but also periods of uncertainty or falling markets when you might otherwise feel less inclined to invest - but actually these periods represent an opportunity to scoop up investments at lower prices,” adds Hollands. “Pound-cost averaging, therefore, can help remove the pull of emotional factors out of investing and turn it into a discipline instead.” Drip-feeding money into investments works best when you commit through thick and thin. That means continuing to invest even when markets are falling and your ISA or pension appears to be losing money. Although it can feel counterintuitive, these are the moments that often fuel your strongest returns later on. Ultimately, stock market ups and downs are normal. A regular investing plan averages out prices over time, capturing the market’s long-term upward trend – but without the stress of trying to time every move.",business,The Independent

OK let’s lay out the basics so you know for later on. : Interest rates are the domain of the Bank of England - specifically, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members. There are nine of them and they vote on rate changes. : Today at noon. The next one is December 18, then there’s not another until February 2026. : The current base rate (what we call ‘the interest rate’) is 4%. The MPC members will vote on whether to keep it the same, raise it or cut it. Usually cuts/raises will be by 0.25% (called 25 basis points) but it’s far from unheard of to be double that or other figures when necessary. If we do see a cut today, it will be the fourth one of the year and the sixth overall in this rate-cutting cycle, which started back in August 2024. The MPC has largely held a “once per quarter” approach to cuts, with 25 basis points knocked off each time in February, May and August so far this year. If a fourth cut arrives - either today or in December - it will be the first time since 2008 that five rate cuts in the same year have been announced. Here’s a view of what we’ve had so far in interest rates over the past few years, from the start of 2021 onwards. The cost of living crisis and rapid rise of inflation across 2022 and 2023 saw interest rates rise quickly to try and stem the tide of that inflation, and though there were 14 raises in total across that period, the BoE did come in for criticism for not doing enough, or not doing it fast enough. Rates peaked at 5.25 per cent and stayed there for a full year, before the rate-cutting cycle started in August 2024. Five cuts later we’re down to 4 per cent, but inflation has stayed higher for longer than expected so the cuts haven’t come as quick as some would have wanted - such as businesses, homeowners and the government, as lower rates tend to see productivity upticks. Looking at a wider lens, this shows interest rates all the way back to 2003. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster at times but after hitting 5.75 per cent pre global financial crisis, there was a long period of basically Not many expect a return to those days, even once inflation is tamed and if/when geopolitical situations return to more or less stability. Inflation and interest rates are eternally linked in our economies. They are complex topics and naturally there is way more to it, but in a nutshell: The BoE uses interest rates to try and control inflation. Higher rates discourage businesses from investing in projects and hiring as many people, which in turn leads to less money in the economy, lower spending from people and therefore less opportunity to raise prices (which is basically what inflation is). Therefore higher rates can help bring down inflation toward a government-set 2 per cent target. Currently we’re at 3.8 per cent inflation. For an introductory explainer on how one impacts the other and how that affects , with savings and mortgage repayments and the like, you can check this article out. While those people due to renew their mortgage soon will be hoping for rate cuts which in turn prompt lenders to reduce their own interest rates, for savers it’s a different matter. Kate Steere, money expert at the personal finance site Finder, believes a rate cut today would mean bad news for savers across the rest of the year. “If there is a base rate cut today, the Bank of England will essentially be giving banks a carte blanche to further slash savings rates. the base rate at the last meeting didn’t stop providers from reducing their rates, with 9 major banks and building societies dropping rates in October and November. “With households already facing uncertainty ahead of the Autumn Budget, a rate cut now would be a blow to savers. They’ve done the right thing by putting money away, yet they risk being punished with shrinking returns at a time when every pound counts.” If you’re planning to set up a new business soon, you might want to incorporate it sooner rather than later. Companies House is increasing a massive raft of fees, including incorporation costs being lifted to £100 - that’s double the current cost. While inflation is unquestionably still an issue here, running at 3.8 per cent, the defining factors for the voters will include specific segments of inflation, how fast it is coming down (disinflation) and so on. That’s where the split in votes come, when the MPC members see different areas as more important, recent trends as more notable (or not) and of course, what they think comes next. “Inflation has almost certainly peaked. Food inflation – a critical concern at the Bank of England this summer – fell back in September and is now running half a percentage point below official forecasts,” explained ING UK economist James Smith. “This all comes at a time when the Bank is visibly divided on how problematic inflation really is.”",business,The Independent

Read our Interest rates are set to be cut before Christmas after inflation fell to an eight-month low in November, economists think. The Bank of England is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs to 3.75% from 4% when it next announces its next decision on Thursday. This would bring borrowing costs down to the lowest rate since the beginning of February 2023. have said the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be encouraged by recent economic data to lower rates at its final meeting of the year. In particular, the decision follows the release of the latest inflation data, which showed a bigger drop to Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation than analysts had been expecting. The rate of CPI fell to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October, the This was largely driven by food and drink inflation which dropped to 4.2% from 4.9%, while alcohol and tobacco prices also eased. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis for , said: “Although 3.2% is still way above the Bank of England’s target, it is expected to be the final piece in the puzzle which will enable rate setters to deliver their own festive gift to borrowers with an interest rate cut on Thursday.” The Bank is tasked with bringing inflation down to the 2% target level. Ms Hewson added: “There are still massive question marks about what 2026 will bring and markets don’t expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates more than once or twice over the next year, so borrowers hoping to see a return to the ultra-low levels many people had become used to will have to adapt.” James Smith, developed market economist for , said the sharp drop in November inflation “green lights” a December rate cut. “Christmas has come early for the doves at the Bank of England, with inflation coming in well below expectations in November,” he said. Mr Smith said he was expecting inflation to edge higher in December, partly due to a seasonal spike in air fares. However, he said the “latest drop in inflation fits into a broader body of evidence suggesting that price pressures are cooling”, adding: “We expect headline inflation to fall pretty close to 2% by May.” He is forecasting another two cuts to interest rates in February and April next year. is expected to take note of other signs that the economy is cooling including rising unemployment, slower wage growth and stagnant economic growth.",business,The Independent

Read our While the pre-Christmas shopping frenzy peaks, 25 per cent of festive shoppers will delay buying some gifts until after Christmas Day, a survey has revealed. This trend is largely due to the cost of living crisis, with many seeking savings in post-Christmas sales. Two-fifths (41 per cent) of those surveyed for cashback website Rakuten see sales as a good way to economise. Additionally, a third (32 per cent) believe money saved by delaying purchases justifies changing the tradition of opening gifts on Christmas Day. Men, the research notes, are more likely than women to postpone gift buying until after the festive period. The survey indicated that shoppers expect to spend £163 on average in the Boxing Day sales. The research also found that, apart from the financial savings, there were other advantages to leaving some gift-buying until after Christmas Day. Some people hold off to avoid pre-Christmas stress and crowds, and some believe that buying gifts after Christmas Day helps to extend the festive atmosphere into the new year. The survey also indicated that many gift recipients will not mind waiting until after 25 December to find something under the Christmas tree with their name on it.

Read our The UK’s financial watchdog is prepared to adjust its proposed motor finance compensation scheme after hearing from more than 1,000 businesses and consumers, its boss has told MPs. Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said some lenders have so far been “very focused on things they don’t like” about its proposals. The FCA’s consultation opened on October 7 and closed on December 12, and invited feedback to its plans for an industry-wide compensation scheme. The regulator is hoping to compensate motorists who were unfairly sold a car loan between 2007 and 2024 because they were not properly informed about the commission paid to brokers, including car dealers. Under the current proposals, about 14 million car finance deals could be eligible for compensation, with people estimated to get an average of £700 per agreement. The scheme is expected to be launched early next year. , Mr Rathi said: “We have had a very wide range of responses – over 1,000 – to our consultation which closed last week, including over 800 individual consumers responding with their views. “We see a range of views and where there is good strong evidence that might persuade us to adjust what we have proposed so that we get to a fair, proportionate scheme, we will consider that evidence.” Mr Rathi used the example of cases where 0% interest was charged on a car loan, saying the regulator was “hearing the arguments that actually there wasn’t a case for compensation with that”. The proposals have been met with significant pushback from lenders including Santander and , particularly challenging the FCA’s calculations for the amount that consumers lost out. “One way or another, we have to figure this out,” Mr Rathi stressed. “While you might say ‘this doesn’t work’, what’s your alternative? “And that’s the point I would make both to the consumer law firms but I would also make to the lenders who have been very focused on things they don’t like, but they also need to help us find solutions if that’s the case.” Elsewhere in the Treasury Committee session, Mr Rathi said it did not spot any cases of insider trading after the Office for Responsibility (OBR) mistakenly published its Budget analysis almost an hour early last month. The chairman of the watchdog, Richard Hughes, resigned in the aftermath of the leak. Mr Rathi told MPs: “During that period between the download of the economic and fiscal outlook and the Budget statement, liquidity did diminish because I think there was so much trading. “But we haven’t identified anything that suggests that there was insider dealing or anything like that.” had had “very good co-operation” from the and that its board “has taken it very seriously and we will provide specific training” to them.

Read our This year has been a miserable one for households after across-the-board price hikes on everything from energy to council tax left many struggling to balance their budgets.

Uswitch spokeswoman Sabrina Hoque said: “Pressure points have been widespread. Energy debt hit an eight-year high in October, with households now owing £780 million to their suppliers. The strain is so severe that more than two million homes say they won’t turn on their heating this winter – a fifth higher than last year. “Similarly, mobile and broadband bills have been a key area of concern, with average annual jumps of £21.99 for broadband and £15.90 for mobile. In the last few months, we have seen nearly every major provider announce updated price rise rates for new customers, with monthly increases going up to as much as £4. “For many broadband and mobile customers, bills are set to rise again in April 2026. If you are out of contract or your deal is set to expire ahead of April, it is time to take action.

The total was on a downwards path during the second half of the 2000s and this trend continued into the 2010s until the EU referendum, after which the headcount began to climb. It grew by 40,000 in the years between 2016 and the start of the pandemic, as thousands of people were recruited to manage the complex and lengthy Brexit process. There was then a further jump once the pandemic was under way, as the Government hired staff to oversee huge projects such as the furlough scheme, testing for Covid-19 and the rollout of the vaccination programme. Civil Service headcount increased by 56,000 between March 2020, when the first lockdown began, and March 2022. Of the current workforce of 554,000 people, almost 446,000 are full-time roles and the remainder are part-time positions. Two Government departments together account for more than a third of the total headcount: the Department for Work & Pensions (97,250, or 17.5% of the total) and the Ministry of Justice (96,715, or 17.4%). The next largest are HM Revenue & Customs (72,885, or 13.1%), the Ministry of Defence (56,870, or 10.3%) and the Home Office (50,810, or 9.2%). These five departments together account for just over two-thirds of the total headcount.",business,The Independent

Read our pointed to a “stark contrast” in approach between management at the and Mossmorran chemical plants as it defended intervening to secure the future of one facility but not the other. was commenting after a £150 million support package was announced to secure 500 jobs at the Grangemouth ethylene plant near Falkirk. The deal will see the UK Government provide £120 million alongside a £30 million investment by owners announced plans to shut its ethylene plant at Mossmorran in Fife in February, putting more than 400 jobs at risk. The UK Government did not intervene to save that facility and the ExxonMobil management has pinned some of the blame for the closure on Government policies, such as taxes on emissions and restrictions on new North Sea oil and gas exploration. Mr Alexander moved to explain the Government’s different stances on the two facilities on Wednesday, insisting ExxonMobil had not been able to offer a “pathway to profitability”. “There are a number of differences,” he told BBC Radio Scotland. “I fully appreciate this is a very difficult time for the Mossmorran workforce, given the approach that’s been taken by ExxonMobil. “I would draw a pretty stark contrast in the dialogue and the discussions that we were able to have with Ineos at Grangemouth and that, frankly, we weren’t able to have with the Mossmorran leadership of ExxonMobil. “When we sat down with (Ineos boss) Jim Ratcliffe, it was pretty clear what was needed in order to be able to deliver a future for the chemical facility in Grangemouth. It was also clear that there had been significant Ineos investment in the plant at Grangemouth. “In contrast, the Mossmorran facility is now 40 years old. It was built to have a 20-year life cycle. Alas, there hasn’t been the scale of investment that many of us would have wished to see in Mossmorran over recent years and when we sat with the Mossmorran management, they weren’t able to give us a pathway to profitability. “The plant’s been losing money every month for five years. They haven’t made the investment. In fact, if you look at ExxonMobil’s record, they’ve closed other chemical facilities in France, in Singapore, they’re moving out of North Sea production. “It was a very different corporate approach from ExxonMobil than the approach that’s been taken by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.” Mr Alexander added: “The reality is Ineos see a very strong future for ethylene production in Scotland. They’re confident, they’re confident in their workforce and in their facility, and that was not a position that we were able to reach with the Mossmorran leadership. “That’s a great regret to me, because I sat with the Mossmorran leadership with an open heart and an open mind to see if there was a way forward. “Despite repeated contact with the British Government, they weren’t able to come forward with proposals. “In contrast, that’s exactly what the Ineos management were able to do. We’ve worked very hard, negotiated hard, reached agreement today, and I think most people right across Scotland will welcome the fact, not only that we’re protecting these 500 jobs on the Grangemouth site, but we’re recognising, critically, chemical production has a big future on the Grangemouth site.” Scottish Housing Secretary Mairi McAllan welcomed the investment in Grangemouth – but was critical of the UK Government. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Breakfast programme, Ms McAllan said: “Every job saved in Scotland is something that I will welcome.” However, she added: “It perhaps feels a little bit too little too late, I am sure some listeners will be wondering why when Grangemouth was facing difficulty initially (the adjacent oil refinery at Grangemouth stopped processing crude oil in April) the Labour Government was missing in action and they might be wondering if this is more about Labour’s collapse in their support in Scotland than a genuine concern for workers. “Everyone remembers the scenes of Labour MPs rushing back to Westminster during recess to save UK Steel in Scunthorpe to nationalise it. “Where were they when they came to Grangemouth? Where were they when it came to Mossmorran? “I think all we can conclude is that the Labour Party, for them Scotland is an afterthought and they are really not very good for Scotland’s industries.”",business,The Independent

Read our The FTSE 100 made strong headway on Wednesday, supported by a larger-than-expected cooling in inflation and a spike in the oil price. The FTSE 100 index closed up 89.53 points, 0.9%, at 9,774.32. It had earlier traded as high as 9,853.13. The FTSE 250 ended 123.78 points higher, 0.6%, at 22,164.76, and the AIM All-Share ended up 2.07 points, 0.3%, at 751.48. The soft UK inflation data sealed the Bank of England’s (BoE) expected interest rate cut on Thursday and increased the likelihood of further reductions in 2026, analysts said. said it “removes the final hurdle that could likely have, in our view, dissuaded the BoE from cutting bank rate tomorrow”. The headline Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose 3.2% year-on-year in November, slowing from 3.6% in October, and well below FXStreet-cited consensus of 3.5%, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics. On a monthly basis, CPI fell by 0.2%, compared with a 0.1% increase a year earlier. November’s figure was below the 3.4% forecast in the recent BoE Monetary Policy Report. Similarly, core CPI inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, slowed to 3.2% from 3.4% against expectations for it to remain unchanged. In addition, closely watched CPI services inflation cooled to 4.4% from 4.5% in October, compared with forecasts for it to remain unchanged. CPI goods inflation slowed to 2.1% from 2.6%. “UK price pressures are rapidly easing amid persistent softness in demand growth. We expect headline inflation to fall towards the BoE’s 2% target over the course of next year,” said Peel Hunt chief economist Kallum Pickering. Mr Pickering thinks the risk now is that the BoE has “fallen behind the curve and may need to play catch-up in 2026”. “We will be paying careful attention to the voting pattern and forward guidance which accompany tomorrow’s BoE decision for a signal that the bank is ready to lean harder against downside risks,” he explained. “Do not be surprised if the BoE sends dovish signals that it stands ready to lean against downside risks next year – implying cuts at successive meetings.” The BoE is forecast to reduce the bank rate to 3.75% from 4.0% on Thursday, after voting for the status quo at meetings in September and November. Mr Pickering said that, following the inflation surprise, money market bets for a BoE cut on Thursday jumped to 97% from 92%, while expectations for the total number of cuts over the next year increased to 2.7 from 2.4. Money markets now put a 65% chance on a cut in the first quarter of 2026, up from 45% prior to Wednesday’s data, he noted. The pound was quoted lower at 1.3359 dollars at the time of the equities close on Wednesday, compared with 1.3429 dollars on Tuesday. Rate-sensitive housebuilders were in vogue, with Barratt Redrow up 3.7% and Persimmon up 2.3%. A rebound in the oil price also provided support in London, with Shell up 1.4% and BP up 0.7%. Brent oil was quoted at 59.91 dollars a barrel at the time of the London equities close on Wednesday, up from 59.01 dollars late Tuesday. Kathleen Brooks, at XTB, said the reversal in prices came after US President announced a “total and complete blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers” going in and out of Venezuela. “This is an unusual move, typically blockades need to be agreed by Congress, so this is a serious escalation of events. Venezuela holds the world’s largest share of oil reserves, hence why this blockade has caused ructions in the energy market,” Ms Brooks pointed out. In Europe on Wednesday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 0.3%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended 0.5% lower. The euro stood at 1.1749 dollars, down against 1.1775 dollars. Against the yen, the dollar was trading higher at 155.55 yen compared with 154.79 yen. Stocks in New York were lower at the time of the London equity close on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2%, the S&P 500 index was 0.7% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1%. The yield on the US 10-year was quoted at 4.17% flat from Tuesday. The yield on the US 30-year Treasury was at 4.83%, also unchanged from Tuesday. Back in London, insurer Phoenix Group rose 3.3% after UBS upgraded it to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, while an upgrade from Berenberg supported miner Bunzl fell 2.0% after backing its 2025 guidance but cautioned that its operating margin is expected to be slightly down in the coming year. In response, JPMorgan analyst Jane Sparrow lowered 2026 earnings per share forecasts by 4% and revenue estimates by 1%, with the bulk of the EPS downgrade being margin-driven, reflecting continued operating expenditure inflation but without price inflation to offset. On the FTSE 250, Serco climbed 7.4% after upgrading guidance for underlying operating profit for this year, citing growth in the defence sector. The Hampshire-based government services outsourcing provider said it now expects 2025 underlying operating profit of around £270 million, up 3.8% from previous guidance of £260 million but 1.5% lower than £274 million in 2024. “We believe Serco is well positioned, with rising defence budgets, attractive fundamentals, and strong balance sheet optionality,” analysts at Peel Hunt said. But Ceres Power’s woes continued, down a further 6.1%, after last week’s critical note from Grizzly Research. Hunting was knocked down 4.6% as Jefferies downgraded to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’.

Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. The FCA highlighted four areas, which they hope the proposed changes will offer benefits to, including innovation and disclosure, as a general improvement in the way the industry works. But the FCA has specifically referenced first-time buyers and other underserved consumers as those they are looking to help. That can include self-employed people, while some lenders already have products which factor in rental payments as proof of ability to repay. Further ways to record and improve the quality of recording rental payments are being sought, to increase the chances of this factor helping people when seeking mortgages. Additionally, boosting options for “later-life lending” is on the agenda as both the average age of first-time purchases continues to rise and older people look to plan retirement more effectively. The FCA says it is “exploring ways to improve advice to help people confidently plan for later life” and wants to “ensure the lifetime mortgage market can meet the changing needs of future customers”. Finally, an emphasis on “protecting vulnerable consumers” will be on the agenda, to ensure lenders can work with people who either have been affected by financial abuse or who are using a mortgage to manage debt. Mary-Lou Press, president of Propertymark (the National Association of Estate Agents), called the changes “welcome recognition” that change was required. “Greater flexibility for first-time buyers, the self-employed, and those with non-traditional or later-life income has the potential to unlock home ownership for groups who have historically been underserved,” Ms Press said. “Moves to simplify rules, modernise affordability assessments and responsibly embrace innovation such as rental payment data and AI-driven advice could make a meaningful difference, provided robust consumer protections remain in place. The fact that the vast majority of mortgages remain out of arrears shows the current system is fundamentally sound, but also that there is room to carefully widen access without increasing risk.” Damien Burke, head of regulatory practice at financial services consultancy Broadstone, added: “The FCA’s mortgage market review signals a clear shift towards a more risk-sensitive and data-driven approach, moving away from blunt affordability rules towards assessments that better reflect real borrower behaviour and lifetime income patterns. “Greater flexibility for first-time buyers, the self-employed and later-life borrowers can widen access without weakening standards, provided lenders continue to anchor decisions in robust credit risk modelling and stress testing.

The jobless figure came in line with the FXStreet-cited market consensus and is the highest level since 2021, as the country emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. The increase in people out of work in the UK came alongside a decline in employment and a moderation in earnings growth. Analysts at ING said the UK labour market is now cooling quickly enough to make it less of an inflation outlier. ING’s James Smith said: “Wage growth is losing steam as the broader job market continues to cool.” He noted that private sector pay is now rising by 3.9% annually, slowing from close to 6% at the start of the year. “Those annual growth rates should steadily move lower over the coming months,” Mr Smith said, adding that “a rate cut on Thursday is highly likely, and we expect two further moves in the first half of 2026.” A separate report showed the UK’s private sector performed better than anticipated in December.

The flash services business activity index climbed to 52.1 in December from 51.3 in November, beating the consensus of 51.5 for December.

Read our Rishi Sunak has said he would make the exact same choices again in setting up a Covid-19 business loan scheme which has since been criticised for the fraud risks it presented. The Tory MP, who served as chancellor during the pandemic, defended the rollout of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme as he appeared for a second day at the UK Covid-19 Inquiry, as the probe turns its attention to the government’s economic response to the crisis. former prime minister also told the inquiry that would have faced “widespread business Armageddon” if the government did not intervene, as he was questioned about the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), another fund which helped prevent small businesses going bust in the early days of lockdown. Fraud and error linked to financial support programmes during the coronavirus pandemic cost taxpayers £10.9 billion, a report by the Tom Hayhoe, the commissioner, also warned in the report that Bounce Back Loans were among the schemes rolled out with significant fraud risks. Speaking at the inquiry, Mr Sunak defended his approach during the pandemic. “I would make the same choice again in the same situation, I would do the same thing again,” he said. Mr Sunak earlier said the government had “eyes wide open about” the risk of fraud in the scheme, which were backed by a 100% guarantee from the government, “and made the judgment that the risks were outweighed by the need”. He added: “Over time, we built in more protections. So if this happens in the future those protections will be there, but at the moment we launched this it was not as if we were sat there and just forgot to do something, that two weeks, four weeks, six weeks later we scratched our head and said we wish we had done that. “That was just not the case. It was a straightforward choice – we can launch this thing now and get going with it so the money gets to businesses, or we can wait, and I think that is the misunderstanding of this. “Waiting, sure you could have lowered the ultimate fraud levels by waiting and building some of these checks, but you have to then be confident that you were going to accept the loss of business that would result from that.” Mr Sunak had earlier insisted the risks of businesses not paying back CBILS loans was “unequivocally” worth it, when balanced against the risks of inaction. He told the inquiry the first few weeks of the pandemic felt “existential”, adding: “We were facing a situation where businesses, I think it actually came from the , I think something like half of all small and medium-sized businesses had less than a month’s cash in the bank. and that is why there was an imperative to act at scale and at pace to prevent what I think would have been catastrophic loss of businesses and jobs. “The independent evaluation has suggested up to three million jobs and half a million businesses that were saved as a result of these interventions.” Mr Sunak cited evidence given to the inquiry which suggested 4% of Covid loans had been estimated to be fraudulent, comparing it with similar levels of fraud in various areas of the welfare system. He added: “None of that is acceptable, everyone wants to see those numbers lower. “But in the context of a scheme that was stood up in days and then implemented over the course of weeks in a crisis, and necessarily having a different approach to these checks, ending up with an estimated fraud level of where it is at the moment, at 4%, which is broadly in line with peacetime schemes elsewhere in government, I think should be seen as a sign that this is far better than I think it was expected at the time.”",business,The Independent

New York-based Stonepeak has agreed to buy a 65% stake in Castrol. Castrol provides lubricants for motorists as well as for commercial vehicles and industrial sectors such as manufacturing.

Ms O’Neill said: “With an extraordinary portfolio of assets, BP has significant potential to re-establish market leadership and grow shareholder value.” BP shares remained largely flat after initially edging higher after market opening on Thursday. Analyst Ashley Kelty, at Panmure Liberum, said: “This is a really positive update, as Murray Auchincloss was one of the chief architects of the disastrous pivot towards low margin renewables that BP undertook under disgraced former chief executive Bernard Looney. “His uninspired leadership has seen BP underperform peers for a number of years. “Ms O’Neill does have a job on her hands as the balance sheet is in poor shape and the bloated cost base needs to be addressed.”",business,The Independent

UK business confidence increased to 47% in December, rising five points from last month and standing 10 points higher than the start of 2025, according to the latest Lloyds Business Barometer. In addition, optimism towards the wider economy reached a four-month high, up 11 points to 42%. The renewed economic optimism offset a slight dip in firms’ expectations for their own trading prospects, which decreased by one point to 52%. “It is great to see business confidence ending the year on a higher note,” said Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Commercial Banking.

Read our Interest rates are set to be cut before Christmas after inflation fell to an eight-month low in November, economists think.

This would bring borrowing costs down to the lowest rate since the beginning of February 2023. have said the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be encouraged by recent economic data to lower rates at its final meeting of the year. In particular, the decision follows the release of the latest inflation data, which showed a bigger drop to Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation than analysts had been expecting. The rate of CPI fell to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October, the This was largely driven by food and drink inflation which dropped to 4.2% from 4.9%, while alcohol and tobacco prices also eased. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis for , said: “Although 3.2% is still way above the Bank of England’s target, it is expected to be the final piece in the puzzle which will enable rate setters to deliver their own festive gift to borrowers with an interest rate cut on Thursday.” The Bank is tasked with bringing inflation down to the 2% target level. Ms Hewson added: “There are still massive question marks about what 2026 will bring and markets don’t expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates more than once or twice over the next year, so borrowers hoping to see a return to the ultra-low levels many people had become used to will have to adapt.” James Smith, developed market economist for , said the sharp drop in November inflation “green lights” a December rate cut. “Christmas has come early for the doves at the Bank of England, with inflation coming in well below expectations in November,” he said. Mr Smith said he was expecting inflation to edge higher in December, partly due to a seasonal spike in air fares.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said firms across the private sector once again expect activity to fall in the next three months, extending a run of negative predictions that began in late 2024. Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony commented: “European markets have entered the final full week of 2025 on a largely tepid tone with many easing back ahead of a shortened week that looks likely to see lower volume and lower volatility.” The CBI’s Alpesh Paleja said: “Our latest surveys round off a disappointing year for private sector growth. They mark a continuation of the headwinds that have plagued businesses over the past 12 months: tepid demand conditions, with households cautious around spending; and strong cost pressures squeezing margins. “Uncertainty ahead of November’s budget also put the brakes on key spending decisions and big projects, choking up pipelines of work. The latest growth Indicator suggests that the alleviation of this uncertainty hasn’t materially boosted activity.” The CBI’s report came as data showed the UK economy suffered a growth slowdown in the third quarter of 2025.

AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson commented: “With the Bank of England expecting growth to come to a standstill in the last few months of the year, thanks in part to the impact of the budget on overall confidence, it’s clear there are huge challenges to overcome if the UK’s growth story is going to become more compelling.” In European equities on Monday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 0.4%, while the DAX 40 ended slightly lower.

Paramount said in its appeal to win over Warner Bros shareholders that its offer would be more likely to pass regulatory scrutiny. Mr Kushner’s decision to pull his firm’s financial backing is seen as taking away a possible advantage for Paramount to secure Mr Trump’s approval. Paramount’s bid still has the financial backing of wealth funds run by three governments in the Persian Gulf, widely reported as Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Paramount earlier revealed it had made six takeover approaches to Warner Bros over 12 weeks, but claimed Warner Bros “never engaged meaningfully”.",business,The Independent

Designed to streamline benefits for all users, the updated scheme replaces the old coloured-tier system with a clearer, more approachable structure. Whether you’re a casual trader, a frequent spender or a committed CRO-holder, Level Up offers ways to get more from your crypto activity. The update also introduces a subscription model for select tiers, removing the need for long-term token lockups and opening up premium benefits to a wider audience. From cashback on everyday spending to complimentary airport lounge access, each tier is carefully curated to suit different lifestyles. Even seasoned users will find the new programme easier to navigate, with clear distinctions between its Basic, Plus, Pro and Private levels. As crypto continues to grow, having a rewards system that aligns with real-world spending and investment habits makes a tangible difference. In the sections that follow, we’ll break down how each tier works and explore the perks available. We’ll also explain how the subscription model and zero trading fees can help both new and experienced users get the most from their crypto journey. The updated Level Up programme consolidates multiple previous tiers into four straightforward categories: Basic, Plus, Pro, and Private. Basic stays free, giving users zero trading fees on the platform and a gentle entry point for those new to crypto. Plus and Pro appeal to users aiming for more rewards, with Pro offering higher cashback rates and additional lifestyle perks. Meanwhile, private continues to cater to CRO-holders, maintaining exclusive benefits for dedicated members. This clear structure removes the guesswork of multiple sub-tiers, making it easier to pinpoint which level matches your use. Each tier brings tangible advantages, from enhanced cashback on the Crypto.com Visa Prepaid Card to airport lounge access and no foreign transaction fees. One of the most notable changes to the Level Up programme is the introduction of monthly subscriptions for the Plus and Pro tiers. Costing £3.99 per month for Plus, and £24.99 per month for Pro, users can enjoy the full range of benefits without locking up CRO tokens. And localised pricing ensures it’s convenient for users across different regions. This minimises obstructions to premium perks and allows more users to enjoy cashback and lifestyle benefits – without committing capital upfront. Plus, existing CRO-holders can still proceed with token lockups for enhanced rewards, while those seeking flexibility can simply subscribe. Level Up is designed to translate crypto activity into real-life advantages. Cashback rates scale from 0 per cent at the Basic level to 5 per cent in the Private tier, making everyday spending more rewarding. Pro members can enjoy four airport lounge visits per year, while Private users gain unlimited access for themselves and a guest. With no FX fees on card transactions, international purchases and travel become fuss-free and more cost-effective. By combining these clear tiers, flexible subscription options and practical rewards, the advanced Level Up programme ensures that every crypto action has value. Understanding the differences between tiers and how to access perks allows users – both new and experienced – to capitalise on convenience and earning potential.",business,The Independent

Revenues grew by nearly a 10th for the markets division to £46.7 million for the year to the end of June, compared with the prior year.

Adjusted earnings for the group dropped sharply by 43% to £7.1 million – well below its original forecast of between £11 million and £13 million. Time Out said its media sales were impacted by an ongoing shift in consumer behaviour away from text-based websites and towards video, particularly on social media, as well as AI searches impacting traffic to its website. This has resulted in rapid growth for its social media audience, but a sharp drop in monthly website visits. The company said it had completed a strategic review of the division and it was now leaning more into the shift by producing more videos and finding new ways to cash in on social media. It told investors it was now expecting the media business to return to profitability for the first half of the new financial year. Chris Ohlund, chief executive of Time Out Group, said: “We have taken decisive action and as a result have seen a material improvement in performance since the financial year end. “The changes will result in a stronger and more focused business, positioning Time Out for a return to profitable growth. “Whilst our financial performance was below our internal targets, Time Out continues to be trusted and relevant as we inspire and enable growing numbers of people every month to experience the best of the city.” Time Out shares were down by around 25% in early trading.",business,The Independent

Mr Roberts has been appointed a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for his significant contributions to the retail industry. Having taken the helm of the UK’s second-largest supermarket chain in 2020, succeeding Mike Coupe, Mr Roberts navigated the company through the unprecedented challenges of the Covid pandemic, escalating food inflation, and rising operational costs. In 2023, he reported to the Government as part of its Business Council and, in 2024, assumed the presidency of IGD (the Institute of Grocery Distribution), further supporting the broader grocery sector. Elsewhere in the business landscape, John Pettigrew, the former chief executive of National Grid, has also been awarded a CBE for his services to energy.

Read our leaders and executives will feel it has been a particularly expensive year as the cost of employment shot up, inflation of raw materials impacted supply chains and both oil and tariff shocks hit in the first half of the year. But perhaps the biggest cost of all was one borne by companies hit by suggests that close to half of British businesses (43 per cent) and three in 10 charities (30 per cent) claimed to have suffered a type of cybersecurity breach or attack in the past year. These include anything from a phishing attack The list of those affected includes some of Britain’s biggest businesses. . Adidas. Co-op Group. Heathrow airport. Harrods. And, of course, (JLR). Each has suffered publicly confirmed cyber hacks. These attacks were not limited to companies either: the German parliament also suffered a breach and, in October, the UK government Organisations have to fight a moving target, one with seemingly limitless capabilities. This isn’t a foe a business and kill and move on from – cyber attacks come in all different ways, from all points of the earth and if one attempt doesn’t work, it just keeps coming. Jason Soroko, a cybersecurity expert and host of the podcast, put it bluntly: “For cyber attacks, 2025 was brutal. 2026 will be worse.” Attackers aren’t just looking to break into digital vaults and extract cash. Data has become incredibly valuable, while damage to economic or manufacturing operations can provide an opportunity for someone else to pick up the slack in demand, meaning state-level involvement is part of the picture at times, too. The truth is, for a business, lost sales are only part of the picture – there’s reputational damage to consider, possible reimbursement or lost opportunity costs, the loss of ongoing clients to rivals and, obviously, the amount spent to fix and then upgrade their own systems too. Cybersecurity Ventures, a noted source of data and research in the cybersecurity sphere, the entire “industry” was worth around $10.5 trillion (£7.8 trillion) this year alone. In country terms, this would make it the third-biggest economy in the world after only the US and China. For individual companies, the reliance is on their accountancy estimates being made public. M&S originally said the hit to its profits would be in the region of £300m, but in November , having recouped £100m in insurance payouts. JLR was not so fortunate as it had not renewed its cyber insurance specifically, meaning it would bear the brunt saw more than 6 million customers’ data stolen, with the final tally Elsewhere, the “cost” is more difficult to place a figure on, but is more wide-ranging and potentially damaging. JLR’s shutdown was big and prolonged enough to contribute towards an economic downturn: car production failed to rebound in September and October across the industry and was one of the big factors in UK GDP contracting by 0.1 per cent in the latter month. There are several good reasons why companies cannot keep cyber crime at bay. Attacks can be multi-pronged in style or timing and have the advantage of being proactive: those in defence must rely on seeing what the attackers are doing and respond accordingly. “Attackers now deploy AI at a speed defenders simply haven’t matched. It’s an asymmetry that widens by the month. Defenders have been slow to adopt stronger authentication, which is like failing to fit better locks on the doors. The attackers take advantage of this,” explained Mr Soroko, who works with online security firm Sectigo. Cybersecurity Ventures, meanwhile, estimates that the “frequency of ransomware attacks on governments, businesses, consumers, and devices will continue to rise [...] to hit once every two seconds by 2031.” It’s a lot to stop – and that’s just the digital version. What about when humans get involved? We know about through texts, emails and more. Why would it be any different for ordinary people at work? “We’re currently seeing youths socially engineer their way into global businesses. After online research and exploiting other breaches to obtain information, a single phone call to a help desk can be enough to persuade them to reset passwords or MFA [multi-factor authentication] tokens,” explained Tim Rawlins, security director at the cyber firm NCC Group. “This opens the door for criminals to move across systems and escalate their access until they have the same level of access as IT teams do.” Co-op notably opted to pull the plug, as it were, locking out those hacking them but also limiting its own initial powers of response as it was deemed that was the safest course of action. The government’s cyber report notes even the biggest firms don’t actually have a set course of action for if they are hit: 53 per cent of medium businesses and 75 per cent of large ones have “have an incident response plan”, it suggests. “Following breaches, organisations can’t afford knee-jerk fixes,” Mr Rawlins adds. “Organisations must work with cyber experts to rebuild their systems safely; seeing how the hackers were able to infiltrate, what they accessed, and how a breach is impacting critical business systems.” But this is a wide-ranging topic, a brand new area for many businesses to deal with and an area of high expertise needed. As such, many remain underprepared to deal with it. Research from compliance company IO suggests that a third of British and American companies don’t feel that governments are doing enough to support and protect them. The pace of technological change means firms are facing an awful lot of “the same, but different”. Hackers looking to exploit gaps in security, individuals unwittingly opening or accessing files, and even external or third-party contributors accidentally letting outsiders in have all been part of the equation this year. Companies essentially have to defend against what they cannot see coming – plus there’s no telling when attackers themselves might decide a particular target is now the ideal one. Moody’s, the global ratings firm, says cyber attacks on banks in particular “are rising and becoming more sophisticated”. If you thought being unable to order a click & collect from M&S for a couple of months was bad, try imagining not being able to make payments, withdraw cash or check your balance. Happily, it does note most banks have “robust defences”, though those financial institutions using technological infrastructure “developed decades ago” and simply building new apps and processes on top of it do present an ongoing concern. Simply put, it’s a race to a never-in-sight finish line to keep security systems updated. For some businesses next year, the question will at some stage inevitably turn to what the best method of containment is, rather than how to keep attackers out. Once the defences are breached, the answer to that question can be a difference worth many, many millions.",business,The Independent

Giving away TV licences for free,2025-12-17T14:53:10.000Z,"is facing a $10bn lawsuit from the office of Donald J Trump, you’d think those with its best interests at heart would be looking for ways to make it more money, not spray it around like confetti. That’s what makes the news that claimants could receive free television licences under sweeping BBC reforms being considered by , the culture secretary, so baffling. We are told the government is looking at how changes to the licence fee “will impact different household budgets”, and working on a new funding system that “better accounts for different household situations”. Please tell me how those who are are supposed to feel about their TV licences doubling? This will, I suspect, only encourage people to join the great switch off, replacing Auntie with TikTok and YouTube, which is what increasing numbers of young people are doing. Now, £174.50 a year for a non-essential service is a hefty bill to pay when money is tight, and money is always tight if you are on benefits. Women, in particular, . The penalty maxes out at £1,000 plus costs. If you can’t afford £174.50, you’re not going to be able to afford a swinging fine on top of that. So Britain’s costly and overcrowded prisons get more overcrowded and costly. Where does this leave the working poor? The people slogging away at low-paying jobs, battered by inflation, struggling with debts, and looking at the bill for the Beeb with something resembling horror. Having grown up in a single-parent household, which was in that position for quite some time, I can tell you it’s not a good feeling looking at the bill for the Beeb when it lands on the doormat. The was, at a times, a real struggle. “Free Beeb for some but you want me to pay more when I’m struggling with a mortgage I can’t really afford? Fine. Then I’m done with it. I’ll get my entertainment elsewhere.” . Culture secretaries rarely are, which is a shame when you consider the importance to the economy of the sector. I wonder if she sees the fire she is playing with here? I wonder if the BBC sees it? It isn’t just that people will switch off. An incoming administration of a different political hue will surely scrap the licence and tell Auntie that it’s time to sink or swim. Such a policy might prove quite popular outside certain privileged enclaves. It is time to face facts: the licence fee is an ugly antique. It is ultimately doomed. Better to accept that and work on something that preserves the best of the institution now, before it gets wrecked later. That would be the progressive move. Does that mean ads on Auntie? Certainly on the iPlayer. But so what? Let people get . I think people probably would subscribe. The BBC has an impressive array of distinctly British content and an enviable back catalogue. Watching it without ads is worth paying for, if you can. The news operation could be funded from the revenues this new model brings in, which is what Sky does now. As for scheduled TV? That’s dying. It will be gone within a generation. This way, people on benefits and hard-working families catch a break. So could everyone else. There will be no more ghastly court cases, no more mothers banged up for non-payment of TV licence fines. There will also be no more rows about the excessive salaries that some of the corporation’s stars pocket. Time for the corporation to accept the future. Ditto, Nandy.",business,The Independent

Read our (BoE) announced on Thursday its decision to , the fourth cut of the year. For December’s vote, the bank’s nine-person Monetary Policy Committee showed just a slight swing compared to last time out pre-Budget in November; a 5-4 split then favouring a hold became a 5-4 split in favour of cutting this time, with governor Andrew Bailey a key switcher. , poor economic figures and rising unemployment, it brings the base rate down to the lowest level in almost three years. Here’s a brief rundown of what the current interest rate might mean for you: over the last few years have meant mortgage repayments going up, then the reverse also holds true: lower rates, lower repayments. However, there are several important things to note. Firstly, that it’s only the interest on the repayments which should change – your capital repayments will naturally decrease the more you pay off your mortgage. Secondly, the base rate isn’t the rate you are necessarily charged by your bank or lender for the mortgage – they’ll base theirs off the BoE rate but it doesn’t have to be the same. More than half a million people do, however, have a mortgage that tracks the BoE interest rate, and those will see an immediate change. Far more have fixed-term deals, which expire each year and need renegotiating – almost 2 million homes are expected to seek renewed deals in 2026. If you’ve got a fixed term on a mortgage plan, you won’t see a change in any case until that comes to an end and you start a new one, but if you’ve already finished and moved onto a standard variable rate deal, then you might see a change in your repayments. New mortgage products tend to be based on swap rates – market agreements based on future expectations of movements – rather than the current bank rate, which is why there has account, it’s the other side of the see-saw: rates going down mean you’ll earn less interest. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. As there has been a bit of a fierce battle raging among banks and building societies for customers, it’s still possible to get good deals if you are happy to lock in for a fixed period of time or contribute regular amounts, with several offering more than 4 per cent until recently. However, it’s likely some will be removed from the market or have their rates altered in the coming days, while many of the best deals in easy access accounts have been below 4.5 per cent for a while now. There are always terms and conditions to be met, so ensure any accounts you open suit your circumstances, but the opportunity still remains to save and earn at a better rate than inflation, which currently sits around 3.2 per cent. Do be aware of the amount of interest you can earn without being taxed, though. If your account interest rate isn’t fixed, banks can always change the rate you get up or down. A tax-efficient way of saving is to use a Cash ISA, where everyone (for now!) has a £20,000 personal allowance each year, which will drop to £12,000 soon, with the other £8,000 reserved for tax-free investing. Credit card repayments and other types of personal loans are, of course, also affected by , as the amount they all charge for borrowing could be altered. For credit card users (and especially for buy now, pay later deals), it’s always ideal to pay off the full amount each month if you are able to, to avoid interest being charged at all – depending on your circumstances and the account type, they can be one of the more costly ways to borrow. Again, it may not be immediate that lenders alter their rates after a base rate change, but get in touch with them to assess your options if you feel your repayments could or should be lower.",business,The Independent

The fall in the price of women’s clothing was another downward driver. “The increase in the cost of goods leaving factories slowed, driven by lower food inflation, while the annual cost of raw materials for businesses continued to rise.” Kris Hamer, director of insight at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said the fall in inflation was driven by “extensive discounting by retailers across Black Friday month”. “With many customers kicking off their Christmas shopping, there will have been relief to see the price of clothing and footwear fall on the year,” he said. “And while high labour and commodity costs have pushed up food inflation over 2025, bigger promotions ahead of Christmas helped to bring this figure down. “As a result, there were deals to be had, with bigger discounts seen for some meat products such as pork, lamb and chicken.” Hargreaves Lansdown’s head of personal finance, Sarah Coles, said: “Energy prices also continued to spark lower inflation, as a lower energy price cap rise in October than the year before mean electricity prices are up just 2.8 per cent and gas prices 2.1 per cent. The brought some good news for energy bills, with the removal of charges that are expected to cut the cost by £150 a year from April. Given that otherwise the forecast was for a rise in the price cap in April, this will be a relief for hard-pressed bill payers.” Karen Betts, CEO of The Food and Drink Federation, added: “It’s good to see food inflation starting to fall, not least as shoppers fill their cupboards for the festive season. Nonetheless, food prices remain higher this Christmas than last and many consumers are having to make tough choices about what they buy this year. “Manufacturers continue to work hard to cut costs and pass any potential savings on to consumers, but themselves continue to face significant cost pressures. To really impact this persistent food inflation, we need government to redouble efforts with food businesses to reduce costs, like energy, and boost growth and productivity to bring down prices in the coming weeks and months across the food and drink supply chain.”",business,The Independent

Bank of England’s key factors and 2026 predictions,2025-12-18T09:11:33.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our ’s (BoE) next meeting to determine is today (18 December), and all eyes will be on the (MPC) and whether its members opt to continue lowering rates. after being cut three times this year – impacts business, consumers and taxpayers through everything from , so what do experts foresee, both this week and beyond? After a hugely divisive vote in November, where analysts were split on their expected outcomes and the eventual MPC vote was 5-4 in favour of a hold, this time it’s a very different story. Almost everybody expects a cut to , as the cautious approach from the BoE meant they gave themselves until after Rachel Reeves’s Budget to decide the next move. Now that the Budget fallout has been absorbed and further data from November has come through, everything points to a base rate cut down to 3.75 per cent. means the BoE can have confidence that a rate cut is well-timed and necessary. Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says “a rate cut is all but guaranteed, though markets should not expect the voting to be unanimous”, while AJ Bell’s head of financial analysis Danni Hewson added “there are signs that we’ve scaled the sneaky second peak” of inflation – which also points to a rate cut. Barclays analyst Jack Meaning wrote in a research note that a cut was also expected, “albeit with a cautious tone”. In other words, most analysts and economists are expecting another split vote with some of the MPC’s more cautious members wanting to stay put while inflation is still well above 2 per cent target, but overall a cut will win the day. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. But interest rate decisions take into account multiple factors over long periods of time, as well as expectations about what lies ahead – and this year has been tricky in both regards. As well as the domestic situation of higher-for-longer inflation, we’ve had more uncertainty in 2025 as a result of Donald Trump’s tariffs, businesses dealing with higher labour costs coming into force, and escalated geopolitical tensions led to a brief oil-price scare. future expectations of the interest rate (swap rates), so changes in that market can already be accounted for. For savers, though, whether or not an immediate cut to variable rates is coming, it’s always worth to make sure your money is earning as much as it can for you. The MPC has nine members, and their votes decide whether the base rate is cut, raised, or kept the same. Among the elements MPC members will have been looking at are job and wages data, the level of inflation across the UK, and economic growth. Each of those has come in for November over the past week and at face value, each says cut, cut, cut will be the outcome: rising unemployment, lowering inflation and no economic growth at all – in fact UK GDP fell 0.1 per cent in the three months to October. Higher inflation is a reason to keep interest rates up, as it can discourage businesses from investing in new projects or hiring – things that in turn raise earnings and spending power. Conversely, fewer jobs and lower wages means less spending power and lower demand, which helps to stem further price rises. Recent key data has shown salary growth slowing and unemployment rising throughout the year. These are factors that can see interest rates decrease, while there are also external factors that can affect the UK, which the government and can have little or no control over. The further into the future we look, the more murky the picture is – much will depend on how the economy reacts to November’s Budget. Barclays are still expecting the next cut in March rather than February, unless economic conditions significantly improve. “There are still massive question marks about what 2026 will bring and markets don’t expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates more than once or twice over the next year, so borrowers hoping to see a return to the ultra-low levels many people had become used to will have to adapt,” added AJ Bell’s Ms Hewson. But the Trades Union Congress want the BoE to go much further, saying it has “been too cautious this year, and inflation is already lower than they expected only last month. So an interest rate cut this week must be the start of a sequence of reductions over the months ahead. It’s long overdue and it’s the shot in the arm that the economy needs.” The next MPC vote dates will be on 5 February, 19 March and 30 April.",business,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/keir-starmer-economy-budget-trade-b2887822.html,Starmer is doing his best to talk up the economy – but 2025 has been a dud,2025-12-20T06:00:00.000Z,"n a weekend, if Arsenal are playing at home and is not abroad for talks about something or other, our anywhere-but-Britain prime minister can be found at the Emirates. Given the length of time he’s followed his favourite team, and not forgetting he still occasionally likes to kick a ball around himself, Starmer must be able to judge the scale of a victory or a defeat. Or so you’d think. This week, he described a new trade deal with as “a huge win for British business and working people”. How much extra will it bring to the UK That has the feel of a triumph for his beloved Gunners over the likes of, er, Doncaster Rovers. Even the most fanatical Gooner would struggle to match Starmer’s glowing assessment. Of course, South Korea is not Doncaster, and it is an agreement with a trading powerhouse. But what is less spoken about is that this pact merely replaces an existing arrangement. That deal was struck in 2019, post-Brexit, and is worth more than £15bn a year. The part that is actually new will generate the £400m. So they are virtually the same. The add-on covers the export of some cars, cans of , and Scottish salmon. Not a lot there. Still, these are British businesses employing working people, so that works. A win is a win, as they say on the terraces. This was Britain’s trade minister, Chris Bryant, on the new London-Seoul alliance: “Today’s agreement secures the UK as a global leader in digital trade and innovation while boosting our world-class services sector, supporting iconic brands, and giving cast-iron protections to our key industries to speed up economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.” Nik Jhangiani, interim chief executive of Guinness’s owner Diageo, said the new trade arrangement would support export growth for Guinness. How much Guinness do they consume in South Korea? Also, isn’t Guinness really made in Dublin, and canned in Runcorn and Belfast? Questions, but still, South Korea joins the US, India, the EU, and other trading partners the government struck deals with in 2025 that form part of Labour’s “further and faster” delivery of economic growth. No matter that most of these arrangements are not exactly transformative, and in some cases merely replace ones that were already there – for instance, the partnership with the EU that was lost when we chose Brexit. Possibly, there are some wins – but nothing jaw-dropping, nothing huge. What also tends to be less emphasised, lest we forget, is what the other country (or bloc) receives in return. In the same week that Starmer and Bryant were crowing, the US announced that the £31bn Tech Prosperity Deal with Britain was being suspended. When that arrangement was unveiled, Starmer said: “This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US.” Technology secretary Liz Kendall said the compact would “transform lives across Britain” and was a “vote of confidence in Britain’s booming AI sector”. Not today it isn’t, since the US has stuck it on hold. This is part of a pattern we have witnessed this year, of every small pro-enterprise step being lauded to the heavens while closer inspection reveals that little has changed. That partly explains the frustration among business leaders, who see a government that makes a lot of noise about helping but in reality is not matching its words with deeds. The dissatisfaction goes beyond this: it’s an administration that in their eyes is anti-business, that has actively sought to target the private sector. A premier, chancellor and ministers who say one thing and do another. We were assured that they were going to galvanise the housing market – the building of 1.5 million homes during their first five years was a manifesto pledge. That does not look likely to happen. Property sales are flat, new-build figures are dismally low, and the country is in the grip of a homelessness crisis. Projects have been unveiled as being exciting and radical when they are nothing of the sort. The nation remains mired in discussing Heathrow expansion; HS2, now much truncated, lumbers on; there is a scheme to link Oxford and Cambridge, and plans for a nuclear power station, and that is about it. No vision, no execution of the sort that business craves and the economy so desperately needs. We have an energy policy that is hard to fathom. Is it renewables or non-renewables? You decide. Meanwhile, the UK is dangerously vulnerable to disruptions in fuel supplies, and exposed to high market prices. Which leaves the Budget. For four months, we were treated to a drip-drip of leaks – some speculative, some apparently well sourced, few denied. Businesses – as ministers would know if they had ever spent serious time working in firms charged with making profits – want certainty. It’s what governs their decision-making and commitment. Without it, they can and will do nothing. Instead, what we got was a buildup that caused activity to stop. It was chaotic and bizarre. Then, just as Rachel Reeves stood up to speak, her Budget was published by mistake. As for what it contained, the answer is very little that would galvanise the economy. “Further and faster” it most definitely was not. We should not complain. Doubtless, we would do well to remember a famous advertising slogan from yesteryear: “Guinness is good for you.”",business,The Independent

Read our File-sharing service Im.ge has been fined £20,000 for failing to provide information to Ofcom in the latest penalty by the watchdog since the Online Safety Act came into force earlier this year. Ofcom launched an investigation into Im.ge in June, alongside six other file-sharing services. New rules under the Online Safety Act require online services to clamp down on child sexual abuse material and put strong safety measures in place for UK users. It launched action to assess the safety measures put in place by file-sharing services, which are seen as susceptible to being exploited by offenders to widely distribute child sexual abuse material. Ofcom sent legally binding requests for information to a raft of these services to assess the prevention measures they have in place. Im.ge has failed to provide the information – originally requested on April 1 – which included a copy of its illegal content risk assessment and information relating to its qualifying worldwide revenue. Ofcom said as well as being hit with a £20,000 fine, Im.ge would face a penalty of £100 every day starting from December 18 for the following 60 days or until it provides the information, whichever is sooner. It is the latest in a series of penalties from Ofcom as part of its crackdown since the Online Safety Act took effect. Pornography company AVS Group, which runs 18 adult websites, was recently fined £1 million by Ofcom for not having strong enough age checks, plus a further £50,000 for failing to respond to information requests. Ofcom said on Tuesday that AVS has now put in place age checks on the sites being investigated, though the regulator will continue to monitor the sites and their compliance. Suzanne Cater, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said: “Any company that fails to engage with Ofcom and their duties under the Online Safety Act should expect to face robust enforcement action.” She added: “Porn sites must use highly effective age assurance to protect children. “We’ve shown we’ll use our enforcement powers to secure this outcome, and AVS has introduced new age checks after we fined them.” In its probe covering seven file-sharing firms, Ofcom said that two have since put in place so-called hash-matching technology – an automated online tool that can detect and remove child sexual abuse material before it spreads further. Other providers took steps to prevent people in the UK from accessing their sites while three firms remain under investigation, including Im.ge.

But if he is right, they soon will be. He believes there are enough private indicators for him to form a view, even while official statistics remain on hold. From unemployment figures to declining consumer sentiment, the outlook is far from optimistic. Waller’s enthusiasm for cutting rates to boost the US economy is not universally shared. – the first time since January – enough to stir the rate hawks on the Federal Open Market Committee.

Read our Boxing Day was a “bumper day” for all UK retail destinations as data shows shopper footfall was up 4.4% on last year, making it the strongest increase in more than a decade, industry analysts said. The retail sector may end the year on a “positive note” as December 26 saw shoppers flock to high streets, retail parks and shopping centres. With stores shut on Christmas Day, Boxing Day traditionally sees people stepping back out of their homes to bargain-hunt in the sales. While there was a slow start for high streets and shopping centres, there was a “peak” in visits to UK retail destinations from 5pm to 11pm, according to retail analysts MRI Software – which counts footfall in more than 660 retail destinations across the UK 24/7 through cameras. High streets enjoyed a 3.6% increase in footfall on last Boxing Day while retail parks saw an 8.8% uplift. Shopping centres saw footfall up 2.1% on December 26 2024. Jenni Matthews, retail analyst at MRI Software, told the Press Association: “We did see a slow start to the day for high streets and shopping centres. “Retail parks saw an uplift quite early on and that could be reflecting the sort of stores that were open on those sites – so supermarkets, some were open, some weren’t. “The fact that much of the uplift came from the evening period suggests that people may have been going out for leisure activities or going out for a bite to eat, or making the most of the events and attractions that are still taking place in some towns and cities across the UK.” were open on Boxing Day, Marks and Spencer, Aldi and Ms Matthews said the footfall increase of 4.4% on last year is “the strongest increase seen in over 10 years”. She said the UK saw a “slow lead-up” to Christmas Eve but saw a “big boost” in footfall on December 24, suggesting some shoppers may had “left it to the last minute”. The analyst said many people did their Christmas shopping early on in November. The boost in activity on Boxing Day was said to have been driven by a “peak in visits” to all UK retail destinations from 5pm to 11pm, averaging an increase of 9.6% on last year. This compares with an average increase of 3.1% on Boxing Day 2024 from 6am to 5pm. Coastal towns saw a 16.1% increase in footfall, which may be due to events such as markets held on high streets, according to Ms Matthews. “It’s likely to be event-driven because we know that a lot of stores were still shut yesterday,” Ms Matthews added. Ms Matthews said that, overall, December 26 “proved to be a bumper day for all UK retail destinations”. “With a number of stores still shut and not reopening until today, it’s likely that leisure and hospitality establishments may well have benefited from the annual uplift,” she added. “This is an early indicator that the retail sector may well end the year on a positive note given the challenging times faced at the beginning of the year.”",business,The Independent

Read our UK inflation fell to an eight-month low in November as Black Friday sales and a dip in food prices helped ease the cost of living. The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October, the looks at what is behind the drop and what it means for households and the economy. is the term used to describe the rising price of goods and services. The inflation rate refers to how quickly prices are going up. November’s inflation rate of 3.2% means if an item cost £100 a year ago, it would now cost £103.20. It is below the 3.6% rate recorded in October, meaning that prices are rising at a slower rate than they were before. The ONS said the biggest factor driving inflation down last month was lower food prices. Items such as bread, cereals and cakes, butter, cheese and pasta got cheaper between October and November, while alcoholic drinks including beer and wine also decreased. However, food prices are still higher than they were last year, with the annual inflation rate coming in at 4.2% in November – albeit lower than the 4.9% October rate. The price of some food and drinks has spiked over the past year, with annual rises including beef up 27.7%, chocolate rising by 17.3% and coffee up 14.5%. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance for , said this means that people’s “experiences at the supermarket will still depend enormously on what you buy”. The ONS said its data pointed to there being bigger Black Friday sales this year than in 2024, which helped lower the price of clothes and shoes. Black Friday has become a key time for retailers to attract shoppers with discounts that last well beyond the specific November shopping date. The ONS said women’s clothing fell the most, with falls for items such as trousers and skirts. Ms Coles said that sluggish sales through the year may have “persuaded retailers that they have to work harder to get people through the doors – so discounts were heavier”. While November’s inflation rate fell sharply, some economists have cautioned that it is likely to be a one-off, with factors such as Black Friday sales potentially skewing the data. Rob Wood, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that prices fell by more than expected for items including clothes, furniture and games, toys and hobbies, warning that this will “likely reverse” in the coming months. , said he was expecting inflation to edge higher in December, particularly due to a seasonal spike in air fares. However, he said the “latest drop in inflation fits into a broader body of evidence suggesting that price pressures are cooling”, adding: “We expect headline inflation to fall pretty close to 2% by May.” Most economists think that the latest set of inflation data will be enough to convince policymakers to cut interest rates when they next meet on Thursday. The Bank of England is widely expected to reduce rates to 3.75% from 4%. Charlotte Kennedy, chartered financial planner for Rathbones, said the inflation reading “paves the way for a possible pre-Christmas rate cut, particularly given the need to stimulate the economy and address the ongoing malaise in employment and job opportunities”. “Measures announced at the Budget – such as freezing rail fares until 2027, cutting fuel duty, and reducing energy bill costs – are expected to shave around 0.5 percentage points off headline inflation by the middle of next year,” she said. She added that this raises the prospect of the Bank of England reaching its 2% target rate for CPI inflation “in the not-too-distant future”.",business,The Independent

The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation is widely expected to fall to 3.5% in November, from 3.6% in October. It would mean prices across the UK are continuing to rise, but at a slower rate than before. Inflation remained elevated throughout the summer, but October marked a turning point with the CPI rate dropping for the first time in five months. Economists think that slightly lower prices in supermarkets will have helped inflation cool further last month. Rob Wood and Elliott Jordan-Doak, economists for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that “food prices falling month-on-month” will help “drag inflation down” in November. Food prices had risen sharply in October, official data showed, with inflation for everyday groceries such as bread, cereal, milk and coffee accelerating. The economists predicted that this will help offset a “chunky hotel price rise” and inflation across catering, leisure and hospitality firms remaining elevated during the month, “likely as continued strong labour costs – in part due to payroll tax hikes – boost prices”. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist for , also projected the rate of CPI to fall to 3.5% in November. “After peaking in August, we expect inflation to continue on its downward trajectory,” he said. measures have lowered our projections for inflation for next year – particularly in the spring. Lower energy prices have also helped lower our projections. “We see CPI landing pretty close to target from spring next year before more sustainably returning to target in 2027.” The Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation at its 2% target level. The next set of inflation data will be published a day before the Bank announces its decision on interest rates.

But there is another more unconventional activity that can be hugely popular: Known as the ‘Boxing Day bounce’, websites often record bumper rises in online clicks. At Zoopla for example, Christmas Day is the lowest volume of visitors looking at for sale and this increases by nearly 70 per cent the following day. The growth in traffic then continues, reaching a peak three to four weeks later. As Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla puts it: “After another day spent with family and friends, and perhaps indulging a little too much, many Brits turn their thoughts to property on Boxing Day, with the new year and the goals it brings on the horizon. Our data shows a real mix of browsers.” What’s more, new research shared with by mortgage broker Alexander Hall suggests consumers have market conditions that could make Boxing Day 2025 a favourable time to start searching for a property.

As the table below shows, as of 5 December the number of mortgage products have climbed as much as 68 per cent in one category, compared with 12 months prior. During the same period the average mortgage rate for buy-to-let investors is 0.77 per cent lower, down 0.6 per cent for first-time purchasers, the average rate for home movers has fallen 0.42 per cent and for those remortgaging by 0.34 per cent.

Richard Merrett, managing director of Alexander Hall, says product availability has benefited from the Bank of England holding in recent months which has brought much-needed stability and allowed both lenders and borrowers to plan with greater confidence. He says: “While the Autumn Budget may have disappointed buyers hoping for direct support, the reality is that market conditions this Christmas are considerably more favourable than they were a year ago.” Merrett adds: “What’s more, we’re now seeing clear affordability improvements from an income-to-lending perspective. Many major lenders have strengthened their affordability assessments over recent months, allowing borrowers to access higher loan amounts than were possible a year ago.” The main new update announced in chancellor Rachel Reeves’ Budget was a ‘mansion tax’ impacting residential properties in England worth £2m or more. But there was no changes around stamp duty reform for home buying, much to the disappointment of many would-be buyers. Earlier this month property website Rightmove said it was anticipating a bigger-than-usual Boxing Day bounce, as many of those who paused plans due to Budget uncertainty join the traditional start of the busier home-moving season. The firm’s survey of over 10,000 potential movers found that nearly one in five were waiting for the outcome of the Budget to resume their moving plans. Angela Kerr, director at property advice website HomeOwners Alliance, says factors that make next year look like a good year to move include house prices being relatively stable and mortgage rates edging lower. There remain a number of obstacles that make residential purchases difficult. Kerr comments: “The biggest deterrent for many households remains stamp duty. Our 2025 HomeOwners Survey found 24 per cent of UK homeowners cited stamp duty as a barrier to moving in the past two years.” Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman, says the signs for a Boxing Day bounce are looking good - however his experience is that while the quantity of responses may increase at that time of year, the quality does not always follow. “It takes a while for us to really appreciate how serious activity is likely to be over the next few months,” he said. “I wouldn’t recommend buyers necessarily jumping in and making decisions but to carefully consider what is available and how strong their position is…. Interest rates may come down a little further but they tend to do so for a reason – in order to stimulate the economy amid concerns about growth and activity – so be very careful as to what you can afford.”",business,The Independent

https://www.independent.co.uk/money/capital-gains-tax-bill-rules-tips-investing-isa-cgt-b2888775.html,Capital Gains Tax is becoming a £30bn investor nightmare - here’s why and how to cut your bill,2025-12-22T08:56:54.000Z,"One thing that was clear in last month’s Budget was that the chancellor plans to rely on background rises to plug holes in the public finances. Rachel Reeves may not have increased your income tax rate, but One area where the government will make money is (CGT). Data from Hargreaves Lansdown shows ’s take will rise from £13.7bn at the start of this parliament to £30bn by 2030/31. “The slashing of the CGT allowance has been swift and dramatic,” says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. “It means more people face paying more of this tax, and some people are being exposed to it for the first time,” says Coles. And it’s not the only reason this tax is set to take a bigger bite out of your profits. You pay CGT on profits made from selling or disposing of an asset. The gain is taxed, not the full sale price, and you can deduct some expenses too. Capital Gains Tax is levied on profits from the sale of second homes and buy-to-let properties, as well as investments and assets like art, antiques and jewellery if they are worth more than £6,000 each. Crypto assets are also subject to CGT. Basic-rate income taxpayers pay CGT at 18 per cent, but that rises to 24 per cent for higher and additional rate taxpayers. The leap in CGT receipts is down to several factors. It started with the slashing of the Capital Gains Allowance – that’s the amount you can make from selling assets before tax is due. It was £12,300 in 2023 before being cut to £6,000 and is now just £3,000. Additionally, the main CGT rate has also risen. Back in 2023 basic-rate taxpayers paid it at 10 per cent and the higher rate was 20 per cent. This rose to 18 per cent and 24 per cent in October 2024. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. That increase in rates is even more potent when combined with frozen tax thresholds. As more people are dragged into paying the higher rate of income tax, they will also pay the higher CGT rate. “People are also realising significant gains,” says Coles. “Landlords are continuing to sell up as the rules tighten, and investment properties bought before the pandemic boom may have delivered impressive gains. “Meanwhile record levels of share prices mean those investing outside an or pension may also have bigger CGT bills. Nobody is lamenting having made bigger gains, but they may come with the sting in the tail of higher taxes.” All this means HMRC is set to more than double what it makes from CGT over the next five years. “For wealthy families, entrepreneurs and long-term investors, Capital Gains Tax is more than a technicality; it is a material drag on the value you work hard to create,” says Bertie Scott-Hopkins, director and chartered financial planner at EXE Capital Management. “Fortunately, the UK tax system offers a wide range of legitimate and highly effective strategies to reduce, defer or even eliminate CGT exposure when your planning is proactive and well-structured.” One of the best ways to cut a CGT bill is to make the most of your tax-free allowance and use your spouse or civil partner’s too. We each can make gains of up to £3,000 per tax year without having to pay CGT. You can transfer assets to your spouse or civil partner without attracting any tax so make sure you use both your allowances. This can also help if one of you pays income tax at a lower rate. If assets are transferred to them before sale, then you will cut the CGT rate from 24 per cent to 18 per cent if you are a higher or additional rate taxpayer. “Thoughtful planning of sale dates, particularly between spouses, ensures more gains fall within this tax-free band,” says Scott-Hopkins. Also, use your £20,000 ISA allowance each year. “You should shelter as much of your portfolio in ISAs as possible,” says Coles, as you won’t pay tax on gains or income. If you have investments outside an ISA, you can use the Bed and ISA process to move eligible assets into an ISA. You can also use any losses you’ve made when selling a taxable asset to offset other gains in the same or future tax years. HMRC allows you to offset them for up to four years. “Carrying losses forward creates a valuable buffer that can neutralise future gains and smooth long-term tax exposure,” says Scott-Hopkins. Finally, consider deferring sales until you are in a lower tax band. “Realising gains in a year when income is lower, for example after retirement, can reduce the CGT rate significantly,” he adds. “With careful timing, this becomes one of the simplest and most effective planning tools.”",business,The Independent

Following the figures, many experts were adjusting their forecasts for 2026. “Inflation is fading much faster than everyone thought,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy firm. Dales predicted that inflation could fall to two per cent as soon as April next year. Similarly, James Smith, an economist at Dutch bank ING, said he expects headline inflation to fall “pretty close” to two per cent by May. Alongside lower price pressures and reduced borrowing costs, forecasters expect wage growth to remain strong, which should mean that workers will see a third consecutive year of real wage increases. “This combination of easing inflation, steady pay growth, and lower borrowing costs should help improve the cost-of-living picture,"" Julien Lafargue, Chief Market Strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, said. Those factors combined have many commentators thinking that the Bank of England could cut Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Get a free fractional share worth up to £100. Interest rates set the price of borrowing in the economy, and are an important factor for determining the cost of The most recent rate cut will be a boon for mortgage holders, particularly the half a million people on tracker mortgages who will see an immediate reduction in their monthly repayment rate. For those on fixed-rate deals there won’t be an immediate boost, but the rate reduction will enable lenders to offer better deals to borrowers looking to refinance. Chris Sykes, co-founder of MSP Financial Solutions, said that although the rate cut was expected by many brokers, it still “cements market expectations so…we might see a small amount of additional margin open up,” which would enable lenders to offer cheaper rates. “Rates are currently at the best level we’ve seen in a long time, and there is more of an element of market certainty which is excellent,” he added. The average two-year fixed rate has fallen from 5.48% at the start of the year to 4.86% at the start of December, according to Moneyfacts, while the average five-year fixed rate has dropped from 5.25% to 4.91% over the same period. How far mortgage rates continue falling in the New Year will depend on how many times the Bank of England cuts interest rates. Governor Andrew Bailey sounded a more cautious note on the prospect of further rate cuts than many had anticipated, saying “with every cut we make, how much further we go becomes a closer call”. Still, Simon Gammon, a managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said it was ""not impossible"" that there could be sub-three per cent two-year fixes by spring, predicting a “price war” in January. Sykes agreed. ""I’ve heard from a few lenders that they will be coming out strong in 2026,"" he said. More broadly Sykes said 2026 would be an “active year” for the mortgage market, with around 1.8m fixed-rate mortgage deals due to end. Many borrowers agreed two-year deals in 2023 and 2024, when interest rates were significantly higher, meaning those refinancing could pay hundreds of pounds a month less. “Most of the remortgages we are doing now are improving rates taken a couple of years ago, whereas last year, more often than not, we were telling a client how much more their new mortgage cost would be, as they were on a super low pre-covid rate,” he said. Nevertheless, the Bank of England still estimates that mortgage costs will go up for 43 per cent of households in the next three years, particularly those who agreed five-year deals back in 2020 and 2021. Savers will have less to cheer as a result of Thursday’s interest rate reduction, because it will mean they receive lower returns on their savings. “Returns on cash savings should start to reduce over the coming weeks, while annuity rates, which provide a guaranteed income for life in retirement, might also become less attractive,” Craig Rickman, personal finance expert at interactive investor said. The average easy-access savings rate was 2.56 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, although market-leading accounts still offer over four per cent. Limited access accounts, which require savers to lock up their funds for a specific period of time, typically offer better deals.",business,The Independent

Read our Morrisons is facing a substantial £17 million tax demand from HMRC, stemming from a dispute over the type of paper bags used for its popular rotisserie chickens. The supermarket was issued a bill for £17,034,932 in 2021, with tax authorities asserting that the store-cooked birds are subject to 20 per cent VAT. , introduced by David Cameron's Conservative government in 2012. The high street chain initially believed it had avoided the hot food levy, which sparked widespread public and industry outcry upon its introduction. Supermarkets and bakers, including Greggs, had warned that additional costs would be passed on to consumers. , stipulating that hot food cooked but then allowed to cool naturally would be exempt. Morrisons contends that a 2013 tax inspection of its rotisserie operations concluded that its arrangements – chickens cooked and presented to customers in paper bags some distance from the cooking area – ""appeared acceptable"" to avoid the hot food tax. But in 2021, HMRC said that because Morrisons' chickens were sold in greaseproof paper bags with insulating or moisture resistant qualities, they were liable to be taxed at the standard rate, handing the supermarket the massive bill covering January 2017 to July 2020. The chain appealed against HMRC's ruling, arguing that for tax purposes its chickens were not actual hot food but merely “incidentally hot”. It claimed it had been given a ""legitimate expectation"" by the 2013 inspection that it was complying with the rules. Lawyers argued that it would be unfair for the supermarket now to be ordered to pay huge backdated tax bills for its rotisserie birds. But Judge Mark Baldwin, sitting in the Tax Tribunal, has now ruled against Morrisons, saying that HMRC was right to make the demand. He said: ""Morrisons, which operates a well-known supermarket chain, appeals against a number of assessments ... as a result of HMRC’s decision that the sale of whole cool-down rotisserie chickens in the quarterly VAT periods January 2017 to July 2020 is liable to VAT at the standard rate. The total amount of VAT in issue is £17,034,932. ""Morrisons argues that HMRC gave clear and unambiguous rulings in 2012-2014 that cool-down rotisserie chickens were zero-rated. Morrisons says that it had a legitimate expectation that it could rely on those rulings, that it in fact relied on these rulings for over a decade and that it would be unfair and an abuse of power for HMRC to be able to resile from those rulings retrospectively and assess for past periods. ""Morrisons [says it] put all of its cards face up on the table by proactively inviting HMRC to meetings to discuss the correct VAT rating for cool-down rotisserie chickens and, explaining the background and concept behind cool-down rotisserie chickens, Morrisons then proceeded to invite HMRC officers to consider and clarify HMRC’s position ... by visiting a local store, examining the products on sale and reviewing the signage."" During the hearing, lawyers for Morrisons argued that it ""could not have been more open"" about its chickens and that an HMRC officer had observed cool-down rotisserie birds on display in-store on at least four occasions and had witnessed them being roasted, taken out of the rotisserie and bagged, labelled and displayed immediately. Chickens had been prepared, displayed, packaged and marketed in the same way since HMRC had given approval for them to be zero-rated, the company claimed. In those circumstances, HMRC's attempts to charge VAT retrospectively were ""manifestly unjust"" after a decade of compliance with rulings and guidance and could be ""crippling for a thin margin business"", the supermarket company argued. But the judge said that the picture painted by the supermarket giant did not absolve it of the obligation to pay its tax bill. He said that when the HMRC inspector looked at the chicken in 2013, ""his understanding ... is that they were 'packaged in plain bags, left to cool naturally and made available for self-selection by customers from table type displays in the aisles'"". However the officer had crucially ""thought that the chicken paper bags were plain paper, and therefore non-heat retentive, bags"", which was not the case, he continued. ""We know that the chicken paper bags, although not designed to retain heat, are heat retentive and, much more importantly, are designed to prevent the leakage of hot fluids and grease,"" he said. ""It is not [the HMRC officer's] job to try to work out the properties of the chicken paper bags even if a non-expert could work out how heat retentive these bags were just by looking at them. ""As late as 2021, Morrisons were telling HMRC that the chicken paper bags were not heat retentive, when, as [Morrisons' then finance Director Richard] Nichols readily acknowledged in cross-examination, this was just not true. ""The vast majority of hot takeaway food is standard rated. Selling hot chickens in packaging designed to retain fluids and grease is sufficient on its own for the chickens to be standard rated. ""Morrisons did not make full disclosure of all material information. In particular, Morrisons failed to disclose the heat and grease/fluid retention features of the chicken paper bags,"" the judge concluded, upholding the taxman's decision and confirming the £17m bill. The judge added that, in addition to these proceedings, Morrisons has applied to the High Court for permission to apply for judicial review over the chicken tax row.",business,The Independent

Between seasonal travel, social commitments and next year’s plans to arrange, it’s natural to reassess how our day-to-day purchases fit into the bigger picture. While some begin cancelling unused subscriptions, others take stock of their financial comings and goings. For many, this process involves asking the hard questions: am I getting the most out of my credit card? If you’re looking to help support your everyday purchases, it might be time to explore the With practical features designed to reward steady, regular spending, the Santander Edge credit card is built around predictable costs – not high-stakes purchases driven by complicated tier schemes. It focuses on simple, stress-free cashback and overseas spending benefits, not to mention eligible Santander current account customers will receive £48 cashback when applying for the Edge credit card before 13 January 2026*. If supporting your daily spending in a more structured way sounds like something that could benefit your finances, here’s a closer look at how the card works. The card’s 1 per cent cashback on all purchases (up to £10 per month) is intentionally uncomplicated. There are no shifting categories or seasonal bonuses, just a reliable return based on regular spending. This isn’t going to transform your assets overnight like a lottery win, but it can help to bring a noticeable boost over time. The £4 monthly fee is worth factoring in, but if your monthly spending usually spans groceries, travel and a run of small transactions, this cashback structure could assist in offsetting it. Whether you’re planning a family holiday or are travelling for work, the Santander Edge credit card also features no foreign exchange fees on purchases abroad when using the local currency. Not only can this create more clarity on what you’re actually paying (no exchange rate converters at the checkout), but it also means you’re able to use one card for both home and away, rather than juggling multiple accounts and spending statements. Granted, this won’t earn you airport lounge access or free flights, but in the context of real travel it can help to save money on the small costs which – as everyone knows – can add up fast. Until 13 January 2026, Santander current account customers who open a Santander Edge credit card can receive £48 cashback (the equivalent of the monthly fee for the first year) provided they meet certain criteria. To qualify, you’ll need to set up a Direct Debit and use the card 10 times or more within the first three months. If eligible*, the £48 will be paid to your Santander Edge credit card account by 31 May 2026. For those who don’t yet hold a Santander current account, you could still benefit from a £200 switching incentive** on certain accounts – so it’s worth reviewing all your options. It takes just a few minutes to check your eligibility before applying, won’t affect your credit score and can help clarify whether the Santander Edge credit card is the right fit for your needs.

Nearly one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted, representing over £1 trillion in economic waste and around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. For more than 50 years, SugaRich has been quietly engineering a different path—proving that waste doesn’t need to exist in a circular food system. Today, the business is scaling at pace, expanding across borders, investing in technology and capability to help food manufacturers stop waste before it occurs, recover food as food where possible, and upcycle unavoidable surplus into nutritious animal feed. It is a model rooted in practicality, technology, and measurable environmental impact. “We exist to stop food waste—full stop,” says Alex Keogh, Managing Director of SugaRich. “Where waste can’t be prevented, we keep food as food. Where that isn’t possible, we upcycle it into sustainable animal feed. Every tonne we manage stays in the food chain and out of landfill, anaerobic digestion or incineration.” SugaRich manages more than 500,000 tonnes of surplus food every year from some of the UK and Europe’s largest manufacturers and retailers. The business has refined a model that combines high-quality processing infrastructure with proprietary technology—SugaTrak, its waste-tracking digital platform—to generate full chain-of-custody data, performance analytics, and sustainability reporting. The result: manufacturers get transparency, traceability, and efficiency alongside environmental benefit. “Our customers don’t just want waste gone—they want insight,” Keogh notes. “SugaTrak provides real-time visibility and data that helps them reduce waste in the first place. We don’t just collect surplus — we protect value. Across the food factory our tech shows manufacturers exactly where waste is happening and how to prevent it” SugaTrak doesn’t just stop waste — it makes factories run better. When food stays in production instead of becoming by-product, it cuts labour, energy, water, downtime and wear-and-tear. It unlocks line capacity; boosts yield and drives more saleable product per hour worked. The result? Lower costs, lower emissions, and a meaningfully reduced carbon intensity per unit produced — directly supporting Scope 1 and 2 goals. Preventing waste isn’t “nice to have” — it’s operational excellence with a climate dividend. As sustainability expectations rise from consumers, regulators, and investors, manufacturers need a solution with a demonstrable impact. SugaRich offers both immediate and long-term value: Every tonne of surplus food diverted to animal feed delivers a carbon saving up to six times greater than anaerobic digestion or composting. It avoids agricultural land use, protects natural ecosystems, and reduces feed industry reliance on carbon-intensive imported commodities. “Animal feed isn't a fallback—it’s a high-value circular outcome,” Keogh explains. “We help protect land, avoid emissions, and keep nutrition circulating in our food system. It's the original circular economy.” The business, headquartered in the UK, is now accelerating internationally with strategic acquisitions and partnerships across Spain, France and beyond. This expansion reflects a growing recognition that circularity isn't a sustainability slogan—it's an operational advantage. The model is simple but transformative: localise food waste solutions, integrate technology, reduce environmental burden, and return value back into the supply chain. “We are building a European network capable of handling waste at scale, consistently and transparently,” says Keogh. “The more we grow, the more carbon we save and the more food we keep in our food system.” Beyond its technology and infrastructure, SugaRich is promoting a mindset shift in the industry: waste isn’t inevitable. It is preventable, measurable, and valuable when properly managed. “We always say: waste is data,” Keogh adds. “It tells you how your factory runs, where product escapes and where value leaks. We help capture that value—and we help stop the leaks.” SugaRich’s mission is clear, ambitious, and grounded in decades of operational experience and excellence. “Our goal is a world where food is never wasted,” Keogh concludes. “We are proving that sustainability and commercial performance go hand-in-hand. The circular food economy isn’t coming—it’s already here, and we’re building on it.” To learn more about E2E and the E2E 100, visit For more information on the E2E Profit 100, and to see the full list of winners",business,The Independent

Read our Interest rates have been reduced to their lowest in nearly three years as measures are set to push down on inflation but the Bank of England cautioned that further cuts will be a “closer call”. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to reduce rates from 4% to 3.75%. said the UK has “passed the recent peak in inflation and it has continued to fall”, allowing the to cut borrowing costs for the fourth time this year. “We still think rates are on a gradual path downward,” he added. “But with every cut we make, how much further we go becomes a closer call.” Economists think the pace of interest rate cuts will slow next year as the Bank gets closer to what it deems a “neutral” rate and inflation nears its 2% target level. The latest reduction takes the bank’s base interest rate to its lowest level since early 2023. The nine-person committee voted five to four for a cut, with Mr Bailey among those preferring to lower rates at the Bank’s final meeting of the year. The decision comes after official figures showed Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell sharply to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October. Minutes of the MPC’s meeting read: “This was above the 2% target but, following the Budget announcements on administered prices and indirect taxes, headline inflation was now expected to fall back more quickly in April, to closer to 2%.” It means CPI will near the Bank’s target level considerably earlier than the early 2027 timeframe that it had forecast in November. Measures in the autumn Budget, delivered by Chancellor last month, are likely to lower CPI inflation by around 0.5 percentage points, according to the MPC. This includes one-off support for household energy bills and freezing fuel duty which will kick in from April next year. Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, noted that “for the first time, the committee indicated that it was getting close to the end of its cutting cycle”. “With some of the doves still having one eye on lingering inflation, it seems that most of the MPC are in no rush to deliver the next cut,” he said. He said the “most likely scenario” was that the next cut would come in April. , said: “In 2026, the pace of cuts is expected to slow as interest rates approach the Bank’s estimate of the neutral rate. “The MPC has signalled that the scope for further cuts is narrowing, describing policy as becoming less restrictive.” He added that there was “significant division within the MPC regarding the balance of risks to the inflation outlook”. “As a result, we expect only two interest rate cuts in 2026, taking rates down to 3.25%.” Meanwhile, the MPC said it was expecting the economy to show no growth over the final quarter of 2025. This comes after official data showed a 0.1% contraction in October, which was weaker than it had been expecting. Meagre economic growth as well as a weakening jobs market and slower pay growth pointed to underlying inflation pressures reducing, the Bank said. However, the four MPC members who voted to keep interest rates unchanged were more concerned about prolonged inflation persistence, particularly within the services sector and among wage growth.",business,The Independent

Read our was “convinced” there is a path to sustainability for the ethylene plant in ahead of a £120 million Government investment, he has said. The deal will provide funding for the Olefins & Polymers (O&P) plant – the biggest in the UK – on the site and is hoped to secure 500 jobs, along with a £30 million investment from the plant’s owners, It comes after roughly the same number of jobs at Grangemouth were lost when the oil refinery there closed earlier this year. Speaking at a press conference alongside Chancellor , Mr Kyle said he had been persuaded of the plant’s viability by ownership, including the firm’s head Sir Jim Ratcliffe. “I have been convinced there is a pathway to sustainability, but they needed to get through this period in time to transition to profitability,” he said. “My officials and myself came to that conclusion. “I think this is good value for money, for the public purse and is very good value, particularly for people who work here. “The sustainability that is going to be produced from here will have a huge impact on the workers here, on the broader community, but also the thousands who work in the supply chain locally. “That supply chain would have collapsed had the Government not stepped in and worked with Ineos to get the situation we have today.” Mr Alexander said the funding was effectively “bridging finance”, in the hopes that the plant would be profitable in five years after £100 million was spent to keep it open in the past year. The investment, the Chancellor said, was as a result of the “change” voters wanted at last year’s election. “They elected a Labour Government with more Scottish Labour MPs, and that change means more good jobs paying decent wages and that’s exactly why we’ve stepped in to provide this support alongside business, because there has to be a viable path to profitability,” she said. In a statement, Ineos owner Sir Jim said: “Through the partnership, Ineos and the UK Government have demonstrated their commitment to operating the site and maintaining jobs. “The agreement includes safeguards to protect taxpayers’ money, such as strict assurances that the funding can only be used to improve the site, and also gives the UK Government the right to share in future profits.” Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Climate Action and Energy, Gillian Martin, said: “This is a very welcome announcement. “The Scottish Government has been calling upon the UK Government for months now to intervene to protect jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran at a scale seen in other parts of the UK. This news will give a much-needed boost to the Grangemouth community and the workers at Ineos O&P. “The Scottish Government announced an £8.5 million investment last week at the Grangemouth industrial cluster including in MiAlgae and Celtic Renewables which will create up to 460 jobs, demonstrating that a long-term industrial future at the site is achievable. We will continue to do all we can, within our limited powers, to achieve that.” Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite has long been pushing government to take bolder and more strategic investments in core British industries like Grangemouth to protect jobs and drive growth. “This intervention for the future of the ethylene plant is a welcome step in the right direction – a sign it might be beginning to listen – but it must not be a one-off.” She said it needs to be the start of a “new direction of travel” and called for a “joined-up strategy for a workers’ transition, backed by investment”.",business,The Independent

Responding to the ONS figures, secretary of state for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said it “underlines the scale of the challenge we've inherited”. “That is why we are investing £1.5bn to deliver 50,000 apprenticeships and 350,000 new workplace opportunities for young people – giving them real experience and a foot in the door.” Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, said: “The overall picture continues to be of a weakening labour market. “The number of employees on payroll has fallen again, reflecting subdued hiring activity, while firms told us there were fewer “This weakness is also reflected in an increase in the unemployment rate while vacancies remained broadly flat. “The fall in payroll numbers and increase in unemployment has been seen particularly among some younger age groups.” The ONS said that unemployment jumped by 47,000 for those aged between 25 and 34, while it was 28,000 higher for those aged 16 and 17. Across the market, vacancies fell slightly, down 2,000 to 729,000 between September and November. Martin Beck, chief economist at WPI Strategy, said: “The latest UK labour market data delivered a fresh set of worrying signals, suggesting that a long-running deterioration is still underway. “With employment under pressure from a fragile economy and pay growth continuing to cool, the figures will provide another reason for the Bank of England’s to back an interest rate cut this week.” He added that while there was no repeat of the blow to the jobs market from April’s rise in national insurance contributions (NICs), the recent autumn budget risked compounding troubles. “Further policy pressures – notably another sizeable increase in the next April and new obligations on employers from employment rights legislation – risk adding strain at a point when the labour market can least afford it,” he said. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Indeed, added the data “cements the case for an interest rate cut”. “Looking ahead, planned increases in the minimum wage and the expansion of workers’ rights are set to be further headwinds to labour demand in 2026, particularly in lower-paid sectors where job postings are already down 9 per cent year-on-year,” he said. “Hospitality and retail, already disproportionately affected by last year’s rise in employer national insurance contributions, have seen hiring capacity eroded. As these sectors traditionally provide key entry points for younger workers, the weakening outlook raises growing concerns about rising youth unemployment.”",business,The Independent

Thames Water has declined to comment. , chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, contacted the company in recent weeks raising concerns over the plans for further payments and asked for confirmation about whether the money would be handed out.

Read our The boss of upmarket cinema firm Everyman Media Group has stepped down weeks after warning over sales and profits following poor box office trading. Everyman said Alex Scrimgeour has been replaced on an interim basis by non-executive director Farah Golant, who will lead the company “with the support of the broader management team and board” until a permanent chief executive is appointed. Mr Scrimgeour led the group for nearly five years, having taken the role in January 2021 after heading restaurant chain Cote Brasserie since 2015. His sudden departure follows a profit alert earlier in December as shares plunged to record lows, while the group’s finance director also quit before Christmas. The chain, which runs 49 cinemas across the UK, said at the time that box office performance in the fourth quarter of the year had been weaker than expected, while consumer spending was also under pressure. It told shareholders it expected sales of at least £114.5 million for the year to January 1 and underlying earnings of at least £16.8 million – down from previous guidance for £121.6 million and £20 million respectively. Chairman Philip Jacobson said: “We would like to thank Alex for his commitment to Everyman throughout his tenure. “He has played a pivotal role in the team that successfully led the business through its recovery from Covid, more than doubling revenue and delivering significant Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth.” He added: “Farah has extensive experience across the global creative, entertainment and media industries, and a track record of accelerating growth and cultivating high-performance, results-oriented organisations.” The firm said it had kicked off an external search for Mr Scrimgeour’s permanent replacement. Interim boss Ms Golant has had a career spanning more than 30 years in media and creative industries, with former roles including president of Kyu Group, a collective of leading creative companies, chief executive of the Foundation’s Girl Effect and boss of independent television, film and digital production and distribution group All3Media.

Fast-forward to the present day, and that differentiation has gone up in smoke. “It’s fair to say that 2025 wasn’t a golden year for new film releases, making matters worse for Everyman.” He said: “Everyman has now lost both its chief executive and its finance director over the past fortnight; the latter having resigned on December 15. “That’s unfortunate timing and means the pressure is on to find a new leadership team fast.”",business,The Independent

Read our Efforts have been made to sell the Mossmorran plant which is due to close early next year but a “viable offer” has not been received, bosses have said. The Fife Ethylene Plant will close in February, putting more than 400 jobs at risk in the area, with owners claiming it is not economically viable due to, in part, on Wednesday, ExxonMobil UK chairman Paul Greenwood said there had been both “formal and informal” discussions about a potential sale of the site. “We did not find anybody who is able to offer us a viable offer of taking it over,” he told MPs. “Clearly, we would obviously sell the plant if we could, it’s clearly a much better option for everybody involved – including us – than shutting the plant down. In the discussions the firm had with potential buyers, Mr Greenwood said, none saw the potential of continuing operations as an ethylene plant – which creates a key component in plastics. “Nobody sees that as being economically viable,” he said. “Therefore, we will shut this plant and we will do that in February. “You then have a period, which could be up to about two years, to effectively demolish the site and return the land back to a kind of greenfield basis during all of that period. “If there’s anybody who wishes to come and talk to us… around potential use of that site, potential ways in which they can take over ownership of that and do something, then we’re open to all of that.” He added: “Clearly, we – along with everybody else – would like to see this site continue, would like to see it be valuable, would like to see it provide economic value to the community.” Around 180 ExxonMobil staff face redundancy as a result of the decision, with 250 contractors also at risk. Of the firm’s own staff, about 110 people will face redundancy next spring with the remainder continuing their employment to work on what is expected to be the demolition of the current site. Mr Greenwood appeared after Bob MacGregor, the industrial officer for the Unite trade union, questioned the contentions of the company that it was not economically viable. Mr MacGregor pointed to a £120 million UK Government investment announced on Wednesday for an ethylene plant in Grangemouth as proof of viability. He pushed for the closure of the plant to be paused to allow for a buyer to be found. The union official also criticised both governments, claiming they have not supported workers on the site enough. The Scottish Government, he said, has attempted to organise events as part of its partnership action for continuing employment (Pace) scheme, which aims to help those facing redundancy. “Other than that, I don’t see any support that’s been offered by either government,” he said. “I can see a lot of kind words and soundbites, but I don’t see any real, tangible evidence of any practical support, financial support.” Governments should be stepping in to offer retraining to workers in the hopes of securing work elsewhere, he said. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday, Scottish Secretary said the closure of the plant is “a great regret to me”. He added: “I sat with the Mossmorran leadership with an open heart and an open mind to see if there was a way forward. “Despite repeated contact with the British Government, they weren’t able to come forward with proposals.” Scottish Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said: “Our priority is to secure a sustainable future for the site at Mossmorran and workers at the plant. “After being informed of ExxonMobil’s decision to market its plant on November 11, we activated our Pace initiative to provide workers with skills development and employability support. “Since learning about the announcement, my officials and Scottish Enterprise have been working to secure new opportunities for the Fife Ethylene Plant and its workforce. “However, the UK Government holds the levers for an industrial intervention as we have seen in England and Wales and the ability to address high energy costs.”",business,The Independent

Read our Britain’s biggest chemical plant is to remain open after owner secured a major Government support package, in a deal which will secure around 500 jobs. provide more than £120 million to help keep Ineos’ Olefins & Polymers (O&P) plant at operating, after the future of the site became uncertain earlier this year Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the move is an investment in “good jobs, stronger communities and a modern economy”. Meanwhile, Ineos boss and founder Sir said the funding was “welcome” and would help to support UK manufacturing. The billionaire has previously been critical of the Labour Government’s energy policies and investment environment in the UK. The Government and Ineos will together invest around £150 million into the petrochemicals site, which the UK has deemed “strategically important” for its national infrastructure. Ineos has agreed assurances that funding will only be used to improve the site and allowed the Government a share in future profits. The chemicals giant said it has spent more than £100 million maintaining operations at the site over the past year. However, it comes after Ineos shut down its ethanol manufacturing site and oil refinery at Grangemouth earlier this year, which it had linked to high costs. The Prime Minister added: “When we said we’d protect jobs and invest in Britain’s future, we meant it – and this is proof. “Through partnership, determination and our modern industrial strategy, we’re delivering new opportunities, fresh investment, and security for the next generation of workers in Scotland.” Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: “The UK Government’s decision to step in will protect Grangemouth as a site of strategic national importance and secure 500 vital jobs in the area. “By partnering with Ineos we are backing the plant and its long-term future, giving certainty to workers and the supply chain going forward.” Sir Jim added: “Through the partnership, Ineos and the UK Government have demonstrated their commitment to operating the site and maintaining jobs. “The agreement includes safeguards to protect taxpayers’ money, such as strict assurances that the funding can only be used to improve the site, and also gives the UK Government the right to share in future profits.” Cabinet Secretary for Climate Action and Energy Gillian Martin said: “This is a very welcome announcement. “The Scottish Government has been calling upon the UK Government for months now to intervene to protect jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran at a scale seen in other parts of the UK. This news will give a much-needed boost to the Grangemouth community and the workers at Ineos O&P. “The Scottish Government announced an £8.5 million investment last week at the Grangemouth industrial cluster including in MiAlgae and Celtic Renewables which will create up to 460 jobs, demonstrating that a long-term industrial future at the site is achievable. We will continue to do all we can, within our limited powers, to achieve that.” Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite has long been pushing government to take bolder and more strategic investments in core British industries like Grangemouth to protect jobs and drive growth. “This intervention for the future of the ethylene plant is a welcome step in the right direction – a sign it might be beginning to listen – but it must not be a one-off.” She said it needs to be the start of a “new direction of travel” and called for a “joined-up strategy for a workers’ transition, backed by investment”. Speaking on the BBC Radio Scotland Breakfast show, Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said the package is “good news for Scotland”. Asked whether the UK Government will get any return on future profits, he said the profits of the company are “obviously a matter that will be subject to taxation”. He said: “We’ve negotiated hard, and I can assure you, in terms of the protections and assurances that we’ve received, we believe this represents good value for money for the taxpayer. “It guarantees critical production of critical chemicals, and it also protects 500 jobs in Scotland. “This is good news for Scotland.

Read our is rarely out of the spotlight. But, even by his standards, 2025 has been a full-on year. Over the past 12 months, the entrepreneur-turned-government adviser has reached massive business milestones and suffered serious setbacks. He was also knocked off the top spot as the world’s richest man – and is now further out in front than ever before. All that amid a backdrop of an increasingly challenging economic environment, both across the US and globally – and without factoring in private life developments, which included the But business wise, Musk has been all-action, all year – just not all of it as smooth as he might have wished. Here, takes a look at a year in the life of Elon Musk. It feels a long time ago but the Department of Government Efficiency ( ) only came into being in January 2025, with Musk appointed as a special government employee, effectively giving him a 130-day stint overseeing cuts to the US federal budget, slashing public sector jobs and planning to the tune of almost $10bn. Naturally, plenty of this drew plenty of ire, with “the world’s richest man [of] killing the world’s poorest children”. While it might have been expected that he at least had the backing of the person who appointed him to the role during that spell - President Trump - the relationship proved to be fractious and volatile, descending into all-out personal attacks strewn over social media at one point. In June, Musk called Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” an “abomination” and soon after suggested on X that “the really big bomb [was] Trump is in the Epstein files”. For his part, the president lambasted Musk as a disappointment. The petty squabbles continued as Trump said the administration would be looking at the subsidies paid to Musk’s companies, around potentially ending them - though noting it had “to be fair” to the nation and to the entrepreneur alike. Suggesting he’d “take a look” at deporting Musk was hardly “first buddy” material, either. shareholders that he would be spending “far more time” back to focusing on the EV firm, amid a falling share price and questions over product launches. It would of course be remiss to not detail the successes and milestones that Musk has seen across the year around his many businesses. Though - as is often the case in industry and especially where pushing new boundaries is concerned - many ups can be followed by a down, Musk’s companies do continue to produce. Tesla, for example, launched their long-range Cybertruck variant partway through the year to much acclaim from fans - but a massive recall to tens of thousands of earlier models over parts concerns was a misstep. , Musk’s firm which is developing brain implants to be placed within human skulls to aid people with limited movement to be able control devices using their thoughts, has held multiple clinical trials. He says who are signed up for it, with the potential for positive reach here undeniable, yet there has also been criticism over in the US despite a valuation of $9bn. Elsewhere Grok 4 was launched in July as a new AI model, performed a successful controlled splashdown landing with one of its Starship rockets and The Boring Company showed progress with its ZPIT (Zero People In Tunnel) approach: digging tunnels, moving earth and installing concrete wall segments with no humans inside, improving safety and efficiency along the way. But it’s impossible to separate Musk from one company in particular, and that one has had more downs than ups across 2025: Tesla. : from a high of around $480 near Trump’s vote victory last winter, it sunk to about $220 by April, decimated by public perception of its CEO, falling sales, widespread economic uncertainty over tariffs and questions over the company’s valuation. If investing in Tesla - and investing in individual companies in general - has always been a bit of a rollercoaster, 2025 has perhaps marked the part of the ride with loops, turnbacks and rapid accelerations, heading quickly towards the highest peak as we race toward the end of the calendar year. Beyond it? As with any funfair ride, you never know until you get there - that’s the thrill and the fear of it. Some came in the face of his Doge work, while others were furious at a at Trump’s inauguration. Yet more came as comments emerged from the car maker’s chief executive seemingly trying to entangle himself in other nations’ politics or policies. The upshot was simple enough: falling sales. In Europe in particular, the drop-off has been spectacular - summer data showed Tesla as competition from Chinese manufacturers, reputational damage and a lack of new models all played a part in BYD overtaking it as the dominant emerging EV brand on the continent. Tesla’s market share had fallen to below 1 per cent by that time, and sales are down year-on-year despite EV sales as a whole being up by more than a quarter. Weak sales in India, China and the US add further worries, despite a pickup in September domestically, driven by buyers beating the expiration of tax credits. In Norway, a similar effect gave a recent boost in Europe: Tesla broke records for sales by a single manufacturer in a month in November, but rather than this being a sustainable trend, it appears to have been spurred on by planned increases to taxes on buying EVs which come into effect next year. But Musk has long felt that car sales are not the only, or the biggest, ace up Tesla’s long-term sleeves. Self-driving cars, robotics, AI and data - all these factors are what many investors point to as future revenue prospects for the firm. And those inside and outside the company seem to feel the same way, given the recent events. Musk is already the world’s richest person and has been for some time - aside from a few hours when he Since then, however, Musk has opened up a huge gap again and, at the start of December, had a net worth of $450bn (£340bn) per Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. That places him a full $180bn (£136bn) ahead of now-second-placed Larry Page, of Alphabet. Musk’s net worth has grown by almost $17.5bn (£13.2bn) across the course of 2025 and he did become the first person to hit the $500bn mark for a short period. Yet it’s a figure way beyond even those riches where Musk’s year finishes in the spotlight. Close to a full trillion dollars is at stake in his , voted for and approved by more than three-quarters of shareholders just last month. He’ll earn $878bn (£665bn) across a decade if he continues to lead the growth of the company to significant production and valuation milestones, the last of which would leave Tesla worth $8.5tn (£6.4tn) - the precise market capitalisation value of the world’s two biggest public companies right now as it happens, Nvidia and Apple. The path to those riches is not just a “new chapter [...] but a whole new book,” Musk declared after that pay packet was approved. Whatever pages 2026 writes for Musk and his many projects, he’s unlikely to ever be far from dramatic progress, fervent criticism or eye-catching headlines - and the money milestones keep piling up too.",business,The Independent

Read our Journalists at STV have announced plans to strike next month as part of a row over changes to news programmes in the north of Scotland. The walkout is planned for January 7 next year – the day the broadcaster had planned to launch its new radio station. However STV confirmed on Monday the new station will go on air for the first time 24 hours earlier, on Tuesday January 6. The strike comes after STV announced changes to its service that the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has said will be both “bad for viewers” and “bad for journalism” in the north of Scotland. While the company previously announced plans to replace its central belt and north of Scotland news programmes with a single show from , these were “watered down” by STV bosses. This will see the STV News At 6 programme produced and presented from Glasgow – with about 30% of the programme being specific to the north of Scotland area. The planned strike comes after 94% of NUJ members in a ballot backed industrial action. Nick McGowan-Lowe, NUJ national organiser for Scotland, said: “Our members are angry at the lack of leadership from the top of the company, angry at management’s handling of the proposed changes, and angry that their colleagues are facing compulsory redundancies because of the company’s financial mismanagement. “It is not too late for management to rethink their plans and avoid damaging strikes.” An STV spokesperson said: “The NUJ has notified us of their decision to take action on January 7. This won’t impact the launch of STV Radio, an exciting new growth venture for the business. “Our investment in radio will drive profitable revenue for the company, helping to support our multimillion-pound news operation which is not financially sustainable in its current form and for which we receive no public funding. “Our request to Ofcom for changes to the news commitments in our licences, which they propose to accept, ensures the delivery of newsgathering and coverage right across Scotland on a sustainable basis for the company, and sees the expansion of our digital news service in response to changing news consumption. “As a result of our cost savings plan 28 roles are impacted across our newsrooms, the majority of which have been achieved through voluntary redundancy or redeployment.”",business,The Independent

Read our Consumer loans company International Personal Finance has agreed to a £543 million takeover by US finance firm BasePoint Capital in a move ending nearly two decades as a London-listed firm. The deal comes after months of talks between the pair, with IPF first revealing discussions with BasePoint at the end of July. New York-headquartered BasePoint will pay 235p a share in cash for FTSE 250-listed IPF, marking a 31% premium on the value of shares on July 29, before talks were announced. It marks another blow to the market, adding to a list of firms to have either defected to overseas markets or been bought out over the past year. – offers small consumer loans in nine countries across , with around 1.7 million customers, many of whom are often unable to access credit from mainstream banks. Despite being listed and headquartered in the UK, IPF has no customers in the country. It was set up as a division of Provident Financial in 1997, before being demerged and listed separately in 2007. Eric Schneider, chief executive of BasePoint, said: “IPF is a business we’ve followed for some time and have been consistently impressed by its positioning across nine different geographies as a leading provider of credit to underbanked and underserved individuals. “With our deep experience in consumer specialty finance in the US, we believe BasePoint is well placed to help IPF build on its strengths and continue evolving its business model as a differentiated provider of consumer credit.” Stuart Sinclair, chairman of IPF, said: “The IPF board has been considering its options to ensure that the market value better reflects the business’s opportunities and prospects, having consistently traded at a substantial discount to comparable international businesses over the past 10 years. “Whilst the board continues to believe in the strategy and long-term prospects of IPF on a standalone basis, we recognise that the acquisition allows IPF shareholders to monetise their entire investment for cash at a fair price. “We believe that the business will benefit from BasePoint’s ownership and its commitment to fulfil IPF’s purpose of building a better world through financial inclusion.”",business,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wh-smith-leon-closing-stores-b2891244.html,The high street brands that closed stores in 2025,2025-12-28T23:28:13.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Britain’s high streets have endured a difficult year, as numerous major retail and hospitality brands closed stores, with some long-standing mainstays shutting down permanently. This trend emerged against a backdrop of strained consumer finances, persistent inflation throughout much of the year, and escalating operational costs for businesses. Consequently, many firms initiated restructuring efforts or entered administration. Poundland is among chains to have suffered over the year from pressure on shoppers despite its value proposition. The group was sold for £1 as a result and launched a major restructuring plan. This involved the initial closure of 57 stores in a move which put more than 1,000 jobs at risk. The company, which was bought by investment firm Gordon Brothers, has since announced further tranches of closures and is set to have shut more than 100 sites by the start of 2026, as part of efforts to trim its estate from around 800 sites to between 650 and 700 shops. WH Smith had been a stalwart of UK high streets since its first store opened in 1792, selling everything from crime fiction to confectionery. However, the brand disappeared from the high street after the group sold off all its UK high street retail shops to private equity company Modella Capital to focus on its travel locations, where it will still operate under the brand. As a result, Modella revealed plans to rebrand the chain as TGJones. As it pushed forward with efforts to sell off the high street arm, the group pushed forward with the closure of 20 stores. The UK arm of fashion accessories business Claire’s tumbled into administration this year after its US owner entered bankruptcy. Modella Capital once again appeared in the picture, striking a deal to save 156 stores. However, 145 shops – employing around 1,000 workers – were not part of the deal and closed as a result. In October, Pizza Hut confirmed that 68 of the brand’s UK restaurants would shut after the business running its franchise in the country entered administration. It also shut 11 delivery sites as part of a restructuring which put 1,210 workers at risk of redundancy. DC London Pie, the firm running Pizza Hut’s UK dine-in restaurants, appointed administrators after being impacted by a slowdown in the sector. American hospitality giant Yum! Brands, which owns the global Pizza Hut business, bought the remaining UK restaurant operation in a rescue deal, saving 64 sites. Bodycare was among the brands to disappear from UK high streets for good after it shut all its roughly 150 stores. The retailer was founded in 1970 in Lancashire and sold beauty products, fragrances and other bathroom items. It employed as many as 1,000 people early this year but came under pressure from rising costs and a shortfall in funding, which also affected supplier relationships and led to stock shortages. Fashion chain Quiz shut 23 of its stores after entering administration in February, in a move which hit around 200 workers. It closed the shops despite being bought in a pre-pack administration deal by a subsidiary of the founding Ramzan family. Quiz had started the year searching for emergency funding but fell into insolvency after failing to secure a deal. Leon is closing around 20 of its restaurants after launching a major restructuring in December. The company said it will shut the doors of the worst-performing of its 71 stores. It came after the group was bought back by co-founder John Vincent from supermarket group Asda. Select Fashion was another chain to cease trading in 2025, after the womenswear business came under pressure from growing losses. The business closed all its roughly 80 stores earlier this year and entered liquidation after failing to find a buyer. Home improvement firm Homebase shut 65 shops between January and March after falling into administration late in 2024. Retail group CDS, run by The Range owner Chris Dawson, snapped up the brand but was unable to save all its stores. Bosses at Homebase have said recent years were “incredibly challenging” for DIY stores, blaming “a decline in consumer confidence and spending” after the pandemic. Elsewhere in retail, high street fashion chain New Look shut 15 of its stores in the UK over the year. The group also revealed that it would exit the Republic of Ireland, shutting all its 26 shops in the country, hitting 347 workers, in the face of squeezed consumer spending. In September, Starbucks launched an overhaul which resulted in the closure of some of its UK coffee shops. The group did not disclose exactly how many sites would shut but closed 10 locations in October as part of the process. Upmarket tile retailer Fired Earth slid into administration in October, resulting in the closure of its 20 UK showrooms, and 133 job cuts. Rival Topps Tiles bought the Fired Earth brand, IP, website and around £2.5 million worth of stock but could not save any of the chain’s stores. Scottish craft brewery and bar business Brewdog shut 10 of its sites in July, including its first-ever venue in Aberdeen. The closure plan, which was part of a shake-up of Brewdog’s hospitality arm, put almost 100 jobs at risk. At the start of the year, European fashion giant H&M announced plans to close its seven stores under its Monki brand. It said a “limited number” of these would be transformed into its sister brand Weekday but still closed a number of shops permanently. Retail chain River Island shut 33 shops as part of a restructuring to help support its future. The fashion group pushed through a formal restructuring plan amid fears that the company could collapse into administration without action. It also secured rent reductions on 71 other stores as part of the plan. In April, the arts and craft retailer revealed plans to shut nine of its stores, in a move it said would hit up to 126 workers. It comes after Modella Capital bought the retail business last year.",business,The Independent

Read our Retailers could be overcharging motorists at the pump after the UK’s competition watchdog found profit margins in the sector remain “persistently high” and unexplained. In its first annual road fuel monitoring report, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that, despite a year-on-year fall in prices at the petrol pump, the profit margins made by retailers have been rising over the past year. It said this could not be explained by operating cost pressures, as claimed by supermarkets and other fuel retailers, and signals that competition in the sector is “weak” – which means pump prices are not coming down as much as they could. is pressing ahead with the launch of its new “fuel finder” in 2026, allowing drivers to compare real-time fuel prices, and the CMA said it would take action against retailers that fail to provide data for the scheme. Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA, said: “Fuel margins remain at persistently high levels – and our new analysis shows operating costs do not explain this. “This indicates competition in the sector is weak – if it was working well, drivers could see lower prices at the pump. “We know fuel costs are a big issue for drivers, especially at this time of year with millions making journeys across the country. “This is why the fuel finder scheme is crucial – it will put power back in the hands of motorists and save households money.” The CMA said prices have come down at the pump due to falling wholesale costs, with the average price of petrol at 135p a litre between November 2024 and October 2025, down from 143p a litre in the same period the previous year. The average price of diesel was 142p per litre between November 2024 and October 2025, down from 150p per litre the previous year. But the profits retailers are making on fuel sales are increasing and remain at historically high levels. The CMA first warned over this earlier in 2025, but said in its latest report that it does not believe that operating costs are the reason for retailers increasing profit margins, and that competition has not strengthened since its latest market study in 2023. group the AA said the CMA findings show drivers are being “taken for a ride” and retailers are quick to pass on rises in wholesale costs but slow to respond to falls. The AA said while wholesale costs have fallen by more than 7p a litre since the third week of November, the average price of petrol at the pump has dropped by just two-thirds of a penny. A spokesperson for the AA said: “This is classic ‘rocket and feather’ pricing at the pumps and the bane of UK drivers. “This time it comes as millions of drivers take to the road for Christmas and are being overcharged for their fuel.” head of policy Simon Williams added: “Sadly, many drivers won’t be surprised to hear that they’re still paying too much for their fuel, especially judging by the complaints we receive about large price variations from area to area. “The fuel retailers trade association has claimed that rising operating costs were the reason for average margins on petrol and diesel being higher, but this has now been clearly rejected by the Competition and Markets Authority which says these don’t explain why fuel margins remain high compared to historic levels. “We sincerely hope the new fuel finder scheme, combined with ongoing scrutiny from the CMA, finally leads to increased competition and lower forecourt prices for drivers right across the country.”",business,The Independent

Read our and businesses have endured a bumpy ride over 2025 as the impact of tax hikes and US President Donald Trump’s trade war weighed on the economy, but another slew of interest rate cuts helped cushion the blow. dealt a hammer blow for businesses in April, with the increase in national insurance contributions coinciding with a significant rise in the minimum wage. Warnings that the tax hike would lead to price rises in shops and job cuts appeared to be borne out, as the increasing cost of food saw inflation ratchet up to an annual peak of 3.8% in the summer. As retailers grappled with the double whammy hit to their wage bills, many responded by passing on some of the costs to consumers through price rises. For food retailers, this also coincided with soaring costs for a range of staples, such as meat and beef in particular, coffee and chocolate, as well as a new packaging tax. This sent food and drink inflation back up to 4.9% by October, having been firmly on a downward path in the previous year. As Karen Betts, chief executive of the and Drink Federation, said earlier this year: “Food and drink manufacturers are paying nearly 40% more for ingredients and energy than they were in January 2020, as well as bearing a range of newer regulatory costs, like new packaging taxes and increases to employer national insurance. “Hard-pressed food and drink companies are finding they simply have no choice but to increase prices.” But despite the pressure on inflation, easing wage growth helped the Bank of England deliver some much needed cheer in the form of four rate cuts since the start of the year. A final pre-Christmas reduction in December saw the base rate come down from 4.75% at the start of 2025 to 3.75% by the year end. While good news for over a million mortgage borrowers, it was also a sign of some of the weaknesses in the UK economy – in particular the jobs market. Rising prices was not the only impact of the wage bill pressures for businesses, as many firms cut jobs in response. Britain’s rate of unemployment rose to 5.1% in the three months to October as many of the fears over the impact of rising labour costs came to pass. The rate was the highest for more than four-and-a-half years, but outside the Covid era, it was the highest for nearly a decade. As well as rising wage costs, the unstoppable rise of artificial intelligence (AI) was also increasingly cited as a factor in company decisions worldwide to trim their workforces. Amazon’s announcement in October that around 14,000 corporate jobs worldwide were facing the chop was directly blamed on AI as the online retail titan said it was switching resources to invest more in the new technology. It was a further sign of the shake-up being cause in labour markets across the globe. Another seismic shift in the global economic landscape came in the form of the trade war waged by Mr Soon after taking office for his second term in January, Mr Trump came out fighting with plans for his “liberation day” tariffs in April. It sent shockwaves through most major economies, with the UK no exception. Manufacturing and car sectors were among the hardest hit, with the likes of Aston Martin Lagonda warning over a significant profit impact from new tariffs on UK car imports. As the US imposed a 10% blanket tariff on most UK goods entering the world’s biggest economy, economic growth slowed sharply in April, amid a record drop in exports to America. While leading to a slew of downgrades for UK output, many of the subsequent trade deals struck with the US helped the economy weather the storm and initial gloomy forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP) in the year were eventually revised higher. In November, the UK’s independent watchdog, the upgraded its growth outlook to 1.5% from its previous prediction of a paltry 1%. However, the uncertainty and rampant speculation over tax hikes ahead of the November 26 Budget held back growth in the fourth quarter of the year – with the Bank predicting the economy would flatline in the final three months. While the much-feared income tax rise did not happen, there was little to spur on growth in the Budget, which disappointed many businesses. Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, warned “another year of sluggish growth for the UK economy is expected in 2026”. He said the private sector outlook remains “weak”, with consumers also under pressure as 2025’s rate cuts will not shield those coming off cheap fixed rate deals. But Elliott Jordan-Doak at Pantheon Macroeconomics said he believes the economic gloom will slowly lift in 2026. “The improvement in consumers’ confidence – likely off the back of the Chancellor shelving an income tax hike – bodes well for consumer spending. “GDP growth should accelerate in the first quarter, with the Budget now in the rear-view mirror.”",business,The Independent

Read our Casino and Mecca Bingo firm Rank revealed its business has been the victim of a 7.1 million euro (£6.2 million) payment fraud. in FTSE 250-listed Rank tumbled by up to 9% in Monday morning trading after it warned over the impact on its businesses in Maidenhead-based Rank said: “The group has reported the matter to the relevant law enforcement agencies and is supporting their investigations, as well as carrying out its own internal investigation with the help of an external law firm.” It added that the financial hit would be disclosed as an exceptional and separate item in its 2025/26 results. The fraud marks the latest blow for the firm after the autumn confirmed an increase in remote gaming tax from 21% to 40%, which the firm warned last month would lower its annual earnings by around £46 million. It said this would be offset a little by the £6 million benefit of the Government’s move to ditch bingo duty, but still leaving it with a £40 million earnings impact. The firm will report interim results on January 29. Despite the Budget tax hit, Rank said in August it had been boosted by recent investments to improve its product offering and customer risk management, which it expects to accelerate further following new reforms for casino venues, which were outlined by the Government over the summer. The reforms include easing restriction on the number of gaming machines and sports betting within casinos. Rank said it expected to bring an extra 850 gaming machines into venues this year as a result. Greg Johnson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it was not lowering its profit outlook given the payment fraud was being treated as exceptional. He said interim results were set to show “continued strong momentum and the first benefits from land-based casino reform, which we believe is transformational to the outlook for Rank”.",business,The Independent

Read our Footwear retailer Dr Martens has revealed it is considering expanding its ReWair resale platform outside the US as it looks to capitalise on the boom in the second-hand economy. The UK-headquartered group, whose yellow-stitched boots have been a retro mainstay for decades, launched its ReWair offering in America in March 2024 as part of its aims to be more sustainable. The branded resale platform has been such a success, with more than 10,000 pre-loved pairs sold in the US since launch, the group is now mooting bringing the platform to other countries around the world. Chief executive Ije Nwokorie told the the group was looking at how it could “build that offering out”. He said it had not made a decision on which countries would be next or when, but said “if it’s successful in one place” it was natural to look at expansion. It comes amid a boom in demand for second-hand products in the UK and worldwide. Delivery giant Evri – which has a partnership with pre-loved site Vinted – recently revealed the surge in second-hand shopping and online marketplaces helped it deliver nearly 50 million more parcels over the first half of this year. The ReWair initiative is also bringing new customers to the Dr Martens brand, according to the group. It said 43% of US resale customers were new to the brand as at the end of March. ReWair repairs and restores second-hand footwear and bags, which the firm then authenticates and sells through a dedicated online store. Returned products are also refurbished for resale if possible, or directed to recycling or donation if they cannot be restored. In the UK, Dr Martens does not directly run a branded resale offering but instead has a ReWair shop on the platform, which is run in partnership with The Boot Repair Company. Since launch in April 2022, it has sold more than 13,000 refurbished Dr Martens products. The firm also has an authorised repair service in the UK, which Mr Nwokorie said had been “doing really well” in the UK, with nearly 5,800 customers using it to extend the life of their footwear. “It really plays to our strengths,” he told PA. “And all of that is a revenue stream for us.” As well as tapping into the demand for second-hand products, its resale initiatives come as part of aims for all its products to have a “sustainable end-of-life” option by 2040. This will mean that returned items that cannot be repaired for resale are recycled or donated. In March 2024, Dr Martens launched three products made with Genix Nappa – a new material created from reclaimed leather – to help ensure all its products are made from sustainable materials by 2040.",business,The Independent
