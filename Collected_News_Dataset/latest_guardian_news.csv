This vast impenetrable forest spans the width of the land bridge between South and Central America, but there is almost no way through it: hundreds have lost their lives trying to cross it on foot. Its size and hostility have shielded it from development for millennia, protecting hundreds of species – from harpy eagles and giant anteaters to jaguars and red-crested tamarins – in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. But it has also made it incredibly difficult to protect. Looking after 575,000 hectares (1,420,856 acres) of beach, mangrove and rainforest with just 20 rangers often felt impossible, says Segundo Sugasti, the director of Darién national park. Like tropical forests all over the world, it has been steadily shrinking, with at least 15% lost to logging, mining and cattle ranching in two decades. But in the past three years, Panama has mounted a surprising fightback that could to the rest of the world’s forests. In 2022, the government took a hard line on and modernised its park ranger force, partnered with the NGO Global Conservation and deforestation in the park began to fall. That fall accelerated when President José Raúl Mulino took office in July 2024. Mulino purged the environment ministry of corrupt officials and introduced a blanket moratorium on logging to stop companies exploiting indigenous logging permits. The park ranger force was expanded with 30 new recruits and 11 forestry officers, swelling numbers from six to more than 40. The number of patrols has grown from almost zero in 2022 to 55 in 2024, with more than 150 expected in 2025. “People don’t look at us the same way any more,” Sugasti says. “Now the kids are asking when they can sign up to become a ranger!” In an era when cash-strapped governments are slashing environmental budgets, Jeff Morgan, the director of Global , which partners with the park, says: “It’s a miracle.” “I’ve been in this industry for more than 10 years and worked in 22 countries. I’ve never seen anything like this,” he says. Global Conservation supported the park with new trucks, boats, food and fuel, giving the rangers the tools and confidence to reach areas they once avoided. “Now if we have to go by boat, by truck or by foot, we will go there – no matter how far it is. As long as we feel safe and supported, we will do it,” says Esquivel Ramires, a park ranger. The other significant shift has been in the use of technology. With little phone signal in the rainforest, rangers used to spend much of their time incommunicado, chasing ghosts. By the time alerts of intruders clearing trees reached them, they had already vanished. Rangers have now been given access to cameras, satellites and cloud systems, starting with Elon Musk’s Starlink, and are in constant communication with one another, allowing for a quicker, more coordinated response. Sugasti says: “Before, sending a park ranger to remote zones meant risking their life. Now I can send them to the most far-flung corners quickly, knowing they are safe.” Trail cameras automatically detect movements of logging crews and all officers use EarthRanger – a cloud-based park management system that allows them to share photos, GPS locations and incident reports immediately. If a fire is reported inside the park, they can immediately pinpoint the location of the blaze. The platform also links to external sources such as Global Forest Watch’s real-time fire-detection satellites. No fires took hold in the park in 2024 or 2025, Segasti says.In the past, one or two rangers might have arrived late and alone, now teams of five can be rapidly dispatched together. As a result, the team’s presence is more visible and feared and loggers and miners are retreating. “Illegal mining, the poaching of animals and logging is happening a lot less. They are scared of us now,” says ranger Juan Sebuygera, wearing his green standard-issue, wide-brimmed hat. Most remarkable is that the tech is neither costly nor complex, says Kherson Rodríguez, who manages the Darién project for Global Conservation. EarthRanger and Global Forest Watch’s real-time fire alerts are free: all rangers need is access to Starlink and smartphones. Wider financial support also meant five rusting boat engines that had not been serviced for a decade could be repaired. “Before, [rangers] were not able to do their jobs because they lacked basics like oil, fuel or replacement parts. It is [about] being efficient and giving them what they need, when they need it,” Rodríguez says. The results have been staggering. Forest loss inside the national park plummeted by 88% between 2022 and 2025, reaching its lowest level in 20 years, according to Global Forest Watch. So far this year, logging in the park has fallen to nearly zero, the park says. The reclaiming of Darién national park should help protect one of the region’s largest carbon sinks and the Indigenous groups and many animal species that live there. It also comes as tropical forests across Central America are collapsing. “Nicaragua is gone. Mexico, Guatemala – everything is going now. If you look from Google Earth we are down to these little green patches. It’s the last 10% of what was there 100 years ago. So if we don’t get it right real soon …” Morgan says, trailing off, preferring not to elaborate on the implications of losing the greatest intact rainforest north of the Amazon. reaching the highest level recorded in two decades. Bringing park rangers who still work with pens and notepads into the age of cameras, tablets and cloud computing is a pragmatic way to turn the tide when climate diplomacy at summits like Cop is failing, Morgan says. He says Panama’s turnaround also shows how co-investment – partnering with governments that also invest in conservation – makes rangers more accountable and brings better results. And it is also quicker. “It takes three years to get a USAID or a Defra grant. You do a ton of paperwork, and by the time it’s ready, the government has changed, the president’s now terrible, the park directors are terrible. Everything can be destroyed in that time,” Morgan says. Instead of waiting on climate finance, there should be a push for direct co-investment with governments, Morgan says. “This is just one park. Imagine the difference we could make with just $200,000 a year, times 1,000 parks,” he says.",Luke Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 65% of registered voters in the US think that global heating is affecting the cost of living, Extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, storms and heatwaves, exacerbated by the climate crisis, , with recent spikes in the cost of blamed by experts, at least in part, on global heating. Meanwhile, many Americans have faced rising , with both of these areas also influenced by the climate crisis and the Trump administration’s decision to choke off solar and wind power, often the cheapest source of energy. , which have been championed by the administration and the tech industry for advancing artificial intelligence but attacked by critics for causing planet-heating emissions and raising power bills. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said that despite focus on the climate crisis drifting away among many politicians and activists, many Americans are grasping the connection between rising temperatures and rising bills. “I find it stunning that even some people in the climate community say that we should stop talking about the climate because there’s a cost-of-living crisis going on,” he said. “It’s a fundamental error to treat these issues as mutually exclusive – climate solutions are also cost-of-living solutions. Most of the elite discourse is very bad at estimating or understanding levels of public concern, and this is a good example of this.” In an era where concerns about immigration, crime and inflation appear to dominate, Leiserowitz said that the climate crisis can still motivate voters if handled correctly. “If your kid has asthma, you should care about climate change. If you want to make money, you should care about climate change. If you like chocolate, you should care about climate change,” he said. “If we are stuck talking about this from just a scientific or political standpoint, that’s an incredibly narrow set of stories to tell, when this is the biggest story on the planet.” Since taking office, the Trump administration has set about dismantling public information on the climate crisis and explicitly backing the fossil fuel industry over cleaner forms of energy. The president has said that renewables are a “con job” and a “scam” and has attempted to This agenda is deeply unpopular with a clear majority of Americans, the Yale polling suggests, with nearly eight in 10 registered voters opposing restrictions on climate information and research, while the same proportion of voters reject Trump’s demand that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) be . A further 65% of voters disagree with Trump’s move to “This sort of thing keeps happening – the EPA’s website has been scrubbed of climate information and the administration wants to kill off one of the world’s most pre-eminent climate research organizations for ideological reasons,” said Leiserowitz. “The majority of people think this doesn’t make sense. The last election clearly wasn’t a referendum on climate change – there was very little discussion on it – and yet the administration is treating it as though it was. There was no mandate to do all of this. This is why all the polls show Trump is deeply underwater on all of these issues.” A White House spokesperson did not answer questions as to the unpopularity of the administration’s environmental policies, instead claiming that Trump had “restored common sense to America’s energy and sustainability policies”. “Once again, America is leading an era of energy abundance and countries are lining up to partner with the US for deals to import US energy,” she said. “President Trump has set a strong example for the rest of the world by reversing course on Joe Biden’s green energy scam and is unleashing our natural resources to strengthen our grid stability and lower energy costs for American families and businesses.” The US, unlike most other industrialized countries, remains highly polarized in its consideration of the climate crisis. While the Yale poll found that 59% of voters would prefer to back a candidate who supports action on climate, this number is skewed by the overwhelming majority of Democrats who want this. Just 21% of conservative Republicans, by contrast, want to support a climate hawk candidate, with 37% wanting the complete opposite. “Looking at the long-term trajectory, there’s been a huge increase in the proportion of Americans who think climate change should be a priority for the president and Congress,” said Leiserowitz. “But with Republicans, this number has basically been flat the whole time. It hasn’t changed much.”",Oliver Milman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/nov/24/internationalnews,Dolphins save swimmers from shark,2004-11-24T02:38:11.000Z,"Move over Rover, let Flipper take over. News from New Zealand suggests man's best friend is in fact the bottlenose dolphin. It emerged yesterday that four swimmers were saved from a great white shark by a pod of altruistic dolphins, who swam in circles around them until the humans could escape. Rob Howes, a British-born lifeguard, had gone swimming with his daughter, Niccy, and two of her friends off Ocean beach near Whangarei on the North Island, when the dolphins suddenly appeared. At first, he thought the mammals were being playful, but he soon realised the danger the swimmers were in. ""They started to herd us up, they pushed all four of us together by doing tight circles around us,"" Mr Howes told the New Zealand Press Association. He tried to drift away from the group, but two of the bigger dolphins herded him back - just as he spotted a three-metre [10ft] great white shark heading towards him. ""I just recoiled,"" he said. ""It was only about two metres away from me, the water was crystal clear and it was as clear as the nose on my face. They had corralled us up to protect us."" The dolphins kept their vigil for 40 minutes until the shark lost interest, and the group could swim 100m back to the shore. Another lifeguard, Matt Fleet, on patrol in a lifeboat, saw the dolphins circling the swimmers and slapping their tails on the water to keep them in place. He told the Northern Advocate newspaper that he also had a clear sighting of the shark. ""Some of the people later on the beach tried to tell me it was just another dolphin; but I knew what I saw,"" he said. Although the incident happened on October 30, the swimmers have only just spoken of their rescue. Ingrid Visser, of Orca Research, an environmental group, said the dolphins' behaviour was understandable, as they attack sharks to protect themselves and their young, and similar incidents had been reported round the world. ""They could have sensed the danger to the swimmers, and taken action to protect them,"" she said.",Sam Jones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The independent stores, cafes and restaurants lining Hill Road in the seaside town of Clevedon are hoping to take advantage of the crucial pre-Christmas period. The street’s colourful shops, along with the town’s Victorian pier, are among Clevedon’s best-known landmarks, making Hill Road popular with locals and visitors. It even stood in for the high street in the However, Hill Road’s traders are looking ahead to the new year with concern after proposals by North Somerset council to introduce car parking charges on local streets. They fear customers will be deterred if they have to pay to park, which could reduce footfall, hit trade and even threaten their livelihoods. “We’re greater than the sum of our parts. People come here as a destination. It’s the eclectic mix of independents, it’s the community,” says Sandy Prater, the owner of Fizz gallery, which has recently celebrated its 20th anniversary on Hill Road. Surrounded by paintings of Bristol’s famous Clifton suspension bridge and displays of ornaments, Prater says the council’s introduction of parking charges in neighbouring Nailsea in the summer has already had a worrying impact on local businesses. Amid a backdrop of rising costs, consumers reining in their spending and an uncertain economic environment, the traders fear parking fees could be the final straw for some. They are calling on the local authority to reconsider and recently handed in a petition against the proposed charges signed by more than 3,300 people. Prater adds: “Research shows that when people have to pay, they don’t come as often. We’ve seen it decimate towns and small areas of independents up and down the country.” Indeed, it is a scene being played out across Britain: North Somerset is just one of the country’s that has looked to introduce or increase parking charges in a bid to boost its income. It’s a trend that has been from St Albans to Surrey and Clevedon shoppers can currently park for free on Hill Road and other surrounding streets for two hours. The parking restrictions apply between 8am and 6pm from Monday to Saturday. The council is proposing giving drivers 30 minutes of free parking, before charging £1.50 for a one-hour stay, £2.50 for two hours and £3 for the maximum three-hour stay. The charges would be in operation from 9am to 6pm, Monday to Saturday. Prater fears even nominal fees could deter visitors: “Those popping in on the way home or on the way through just to grab a pint of milk, a birthday card, you would be amazed at how many times that turns into the sale of something quite significant,” she explains. “Those people are not going to add parking charges to that £2.50 card or £1.50 bottle of milk.” The sloping terrain around Hill Road – the clue is in the name – means there isn’t space for a car park, requiring visitors to park on the street. On the day the Guardian visited, almost all the spaces were taken, which the traders insist highlights the street’s popularity. The current parking rules suit the brides-to-be who visit Devvon Wilsher-Day’s shop So Gorgeous Bridal to try on wedding dresses. “Customers come for two-hour appointments, so it works fantastically for us at the moment, because of the two hours free parking,” she says, sitting next to racks of lace and satin creations. Wilsher-Day acknowledges her customers might be willing to pay for parking, but calls the council’s plans “shortsighted”. “If people are coming to Clevedon and spending money in the shops here and local residents run the shops and spend money back in the economy, it’s a wonderful thing,” she says. Wilsher-Day and her mother moved their shop to Clevedon just 18 months ago after years based in a suburb of nearby Weston-super-Mare, where they believe the introduction of parking charges contributed to the decline of the local high street. North Somerset first set out its parking proposals in 2024, saying it would apply a consistent approach to on-street parking, council-owned car parks and other land it owns. It said one of its goals was to create “well-managed and well-maintained parking facilities” that “support local economies” while responding to the challenges of the climate crisis and fostering healthy communities. It also announced its ambitions for “parking that is self-funding where possible or which creates surplus for the council” to be invested back into parking and transport. Local authorities introducing parking charges often suggesting that having to pay to park does not have a negative effect on town centre footfall, while “free” parking is typically covered by taxpayers when the local authority has to pay for the upkeep of spaces and enforcement of the regulations. However, the Hill Road traders are not persuaded by this, says David Sims, who owns the independent bookshop Books on the Hill. “If you look at the places where they’ve done those studies, they’re not here. They haven’t got characteristics like this.” Sims and others worry customers will drive instead to the large Cribbs Causeway out-of-town shopping centre and retail park about 15 miles up the road, where parking is free, or shop online. The council, run by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and independents, has not yet approved the parking charge proposals, nor set a date for their introduction. However, it may face a legal challenge from among its own ranks, according to the Conservative councillor Chris Blades, who sits on North Somerset council and also chairs Clevedon town council. “Along with the business improvement district we have got solicitors involved,” he says. “The town council is vehemently opposed.” Some locals say North Somerset council has form. It spent about £1.5m to install – and – controversial “wiggly” road markings in Clevedon, which was labelled a However, not everyone is opposed to the council’s plans. One resident, Paul Hitchcock, says: “As long as it’s brought in carefully, I think it’s inevitable. Part of me thinks it would stop the parking spaces from being blocked all day.” A spokesperson for North Somerset council said the introduction of parking charges had been “subject to extensive engagement with the public” and it had considered “all views given”, resulting in a lower tariff being proposed for Hill Road than elsewhere. They added: “In Nailsea, we have sold over 36,000 tickets since introducing charges and ticket data shows a month-on-month increase in car park use during that time.”",Joanna Partridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we weren’t getting stuck in ditches in muddy fields, we’d be driving to the south of Spain in search of olive oil and life. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. That education led to a lifelong passion for Spanish and Italian cuisine, and I’m still enamoured of their effortless simplicity, technique and flavour. The bedrock of Mediterranean cuisine is founded on heritage products created for preservation: prosciutto, coppa and bresaola (cured beef) from Italy, and jamón serrano, lomo and chorizo from Spain, to name just a few. With a bounty of regional food products to feast on, most festive meals begin with antipasti, tapas or pintxos: small snacks of charcuterie, preserved vegetables and more elaborate small plates, crostini, flavoursome ferments and preserves, cheese and crunchy snacks, such as dried fava beans or corn. My favourite meals often begin with these treats. Supermarkets sell assorted antipasti and tapas charcuterie platters, and today I’ve tested 10 selection packs. The quality was generally high, with wafer-thin slices of well-cured charcuterie, though animal welfare credentials were notably lacking and nitrate- and nitrite-free products hard to find. That said, most prosciutto is cured simply with salt, so that’s a great choice if you want to avoid those compounds. Three cured meats: PDO prosciutto di Parma and salame brianza, and coppa. Quintessentially Italian with delicate, wafer-thin slices, all made from Italian pork. Waitrose has committed to sourcing continental meat to specific standards and to improving traceability. High quality and great value. Exquisite, deeply cured serrano ham, chorizo, salchichón and lomo, all helpfully individually packed, so you can enjoy them across several days. Tender, thin slices that melt in the mouth. Produced by Cárnicas Iglesias, a heritage Salamanca brand since 1928, using Spanish pork. Very good quality for the price. A trio from Lombardy: Milano salami, spianata Romana salami and lonza (cured loin). Classic Italian flavours with a subtle sweetness. Wafer-thin, very tender and a rare high-welfare option. The only independent product in the test group, and proof that quality charcuterie can be made in the UK. Six outdoor-bred pork snack salamis (three plain and three fennel and chilli), award-winning air-dried ham and beef bresaola, all with outstanding depth of flavour. Eye-wateringly expensive, yes, but great for a special occasion. A trio of prosciutto di Parma, salami Milano and bresaola (cured beef). The bresaola adds an element of variety, while the classic salami and ham are well-flavoured, if slightly salty. The 24-month-cured ham is almost too thin to lift out of the tray, though. Made in Italy with Italian pork and British beef. Classic M&S quality and great value. A generous party pack featuring four styles of meat: dry-cured ham, coppa, garlic salami and spicy salami. The coppa, with its thick marbling and aromatic notes of nutmeg and coriander, stands out, while the spicy salami has a nice kick. Good value and great taste. A traditional selection featuring sweet, extra-thin prosciutto with fine marbling and garlicky, peppery, medium-thin salami. A straightforward and tasty antipasto made with Italian pork. A trio of classic meats: prosciutto crudo and Napoli and Milano salami. Sweet, well-cured ham, and there are fragrant whole peppercorns in the salami. Clean, well-kept slices with a good overall texture. Packed in Italy using a mix of Italian and Dutch pork. A classic selection of salami, air-dried ham and . The latter is the standout, with a piquant, aromatic and complex flavour. Wafer-thin slices that really do melt in the mouth. A good low-cost option offering good flavour for the price. A selection of prosciutto, coppa and Milano salami. The coppa is the star, with a deep red colour, marbled fat and a medium-thin cut that helps it retain some bite, though it is a touch salty.

Whittingham, 66, has agreed to a five-year deal that is expected to be formally announced later on Friday, ESPN’s Pete Thamel and Dan Wetzel reported. The move comes weeks after Whittingham stepped down from his long-held position at Utah, where he spent 21 seasons as head coach and became the most successful figure in the program’s history. At Utah, Whittingham compiled a 177-88 record and led the Utes to consistent relevance at the national level, including an unbeaten 13-0 campaign in 2008. His overall winning percentage of 66.8% and longevity at a single program have long positioned him as a future inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame. When Whittingham announced his departure from Utah earlier this month, he made clear he was not retiring from coaching, joking publicly that he was entering “the transfer portal.” The phrasing of his exit – described as stepping down rather than retiring – immediately fueled speculation that another high-profile opportunity could be imminent. Michigan’s vacancy emerged under far different circumstances.

All feature products that have been tried and tested, sniffed, sampled, played with or worn by our writers. In the case of our many kids’ gift guides, the children themselves told us what they wanted for Christmas; elsewhere, our readers told us about the gifts they’ve given or received that have lasted decades. Less like shopping inspo and more like personal recommendations from a friend, these gifts are far less likely to be snubbed, break by New Year’s Eve, or end up in the re-gifting drawer. And it’s not just gifts. We’ve tested and rated often overpriced and overpackaged Advent calendars to see if they’re worth the money, and how wasteful they are; and we’ve unboxed and erected artificial Christmas trees . The Carbon Trust says using a fake tree over seven to 20 years (depending on its weight and materials) can create fewer emissions than buying a new, commercially grown tree every year. The key is to buy an artificial tree you’ll love enough to roll out for decades – which is where our test comes in. We’ve also eaten and drunk our way through mince pies, cheeseboard chutneys, festive drinks, Christmas crisps, sandwiches and much more, so you don’t waste money on food that might otherwise end up in the food waste bin. And we’ve offered ideas on this Christmas, from investing in reusable crackers to making the most of your leftovers. From rigorous tests on products such as mattresses, coffee machines, tents, kettles and reusable coffee cups, to advice on how to make things last longer – from leather to kitchen knives – we aim to help readers make better, more informed decisions. And to encourage more thoughtful purchases so that our readers will, ultimately, consume less. Now Christmas is nearly over, we’re looking ahead to 2026, a year which will probably bring yet more extreme weather, alarming climate disasters and record heat. We’ll put more products through their paces and help you find the most sustainable, repairable and even refurbished choices. We’ll dig deep into secondhand shopping, help you make more of your things last longer, and advise you on what you shouldn’t buy.",Hannah Booth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We can do it again",2025-04-11T07:00:01.000Z,"Professor Alexandra Bitušíková explains how face-to-face local activism was crucial in bringing down Marian Kotleba, leader of the People’s Party Our Slovakia Having grown up in Banská Bystrica in totalitarian Czechoslovakia, I vividly remember standing in the city’s historic square a few days after 17 November 1989, the start , holding candles in solidarity with the students protesting in Prague. Never would I have imagined that 35 years later, I would be speaking at a rally in the same square, this time urging the preservation of democracy. Back then, when I was a young social anthropology academic at our local university, activism was far from my mind. But everything changed for me in 2013 when , leader of the neo-Nazi People’s Party Our Slovakia, was elected as regional governor. The shock was enormous. No one I knew had believed that such an outcome was possible, yet it happened. Realising the dangers this posed, many like-minded individuals knew we couldn’t stand by idly. On the night after the election, a group of us gathered on the steps of the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising, a site symbolising resistance against Nazi Germany and its Slovak puppet state. Echoing the past, we lit candles, shed tears, sang songs and embraced. That moment marked the beginning of our discussion of how to promote democratic values actively. Our goal was not to oppose a democratically elected candidate but to cultivate democratic awareness throughout the region and . Not to talk but to do. From this small gathering emerged an informal grassroots movement that played a crucial role in mobilising civil society against Kotleba and his extremist party. A few hundred volunteers, with no prior activism experience, were driven by the passion to defend our freedoms and ensure Slovakia never returned to its history of Nazi or communist tyranny. The struggle was long and often discouraging. In 2016, Kotleba’s party gained seats in the national parliament, emboldening his supporters. Yet in 2017, after four years of relentless effort, we succeeded in helping to oust Kotleba as regional governor. Our movement, Not in Our Town (Niot), exposed his extremist ideology through public discussions, educational programmes, protests and cultural events. We worked with journalists, academics and activists to distribute fact-based flyers detailing his mismanagement of the economy, his and harmful policies. We organised screenings of films like A Hole in the Head (about the Roma Holocaust) and The White World According to Daliborek (a documentary about contemporary neo-Nazis). We also engaged schools and local organisations to educate young people about democracy, tolerance and Slovakia’s history of extremism. Our Schools for Democracy programme, a joint initiative of Niot and the Centre for Community Organising, used a method called living libraries, where individuals from various minority groups shared their life stories in classrooms. A critical strategy was increasing voter participation, since Kotleba’s 2013 victory resulted largely from low turnout and apathy: in the run-off that elected him, . Through social media campaigns, door-to-door outreach and public events, Niot encouraged citizens to vote in the 2017 elections. Our campaign Spolu je nás viac (Together We Are Stronger) directly engaged voters, explaining how abstention enabled extremism. For example, we showed how Kotleba rejected in EU funds that could have improved schools and hospitals. Most impactful, however, was talking to people face to face. This way we were able to explain Kotleba’s failures as a governor: blocking EU funds, neglecting economic growth and implementing discriminatory practices , Jews and migrants. None of these had put money in people’s pockets – in fact, Kotleba’s governorship had made life worse for many ordinary voters. Under his leadership, the Banská Bystrica region had the Recognising that fragmented opposition had weakened past election efforts, Niot facilitated dialogue among democratic and moderate groups to unite behind a single democratic candidate. Ján Lunter, a respected businessman and credible alternative to Kotleba, emerged as the strongest challenger. Our efforts paid off. In the 2017 regional elections, Lunter won nearly 49%, while Kotleba suffered a crushing defeat with only 23%. It was a decisive moment, proving the power of grassroots activism. We were happy, but we knew this was only one battle in a longer struggle. Then, in October 2023, Robert Fico became Slovakia’s prime minister for the fourth time, adopting an increasingly anti-EU and pro-Russia stance. His government widely seen as attempts to shield party affiliates from corruption investigations. Civil society mobilised once again. in Moscow – without any public explanation. The next day, just before Christmas, Niot organised the first protest against Fico’s visit to Moscow and his foreign policy. Despite the holiday season, hundreds gathered in Banská Bystrica. Since then, Niot has held weekly protests and marches each Friday, featuring speeches by activists, artists and academics. We coordinate closely with movements – such as Peace for Ukraine – in other cities, maintaining a peaceful, non-violent and pro-democratic stance. Police cooperation has been excellent. Our key message since December 2024 is simple: “Slovakia is Europe. We are Europe”. Living less than 220 miles (350km) from Ukraine’s border, the prospect of Slovakia aligning with Russia is alarming. Our protests have grown, now attracting 5,000 to 10,000 weekly participants in Banská Bystrica, a town of 75,000. , more than 100,000 people took part in protests in more than 40 Slovak cities as well as in cities abroad such as Prague, Brno, London, Luxembourg, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen and New York. Despite threats, we refuse to be silenced. In January 2025, a channel published the home addresses of several Niot activists, leading to increased police monitoring of local activists. Nevertheless, Niot continues to organise protests and public discussions across Slovakia to foster dialogue and engagement among diverse communities. Our organisation remains an informal grassroots platform, without a legal status. Decisions are made collectively, and our mailing list includes only about 150 citizens. The initiative’s strength is in its diversity and authenticity. And in lots of off-line, face-to-face discussions that contribute to building mutual trust. We simply follow our right to gather, express our views and act on facts. Slovakia is one of Europe’s most beautiful yet often overlooked countries. Though small in size, the Niot movement is determined to defend democracy here. It is not extremism but indifference that is the real enemy of freedom. Since the Velvet Revolution and our accession to the EU in 2004, Slovakia has flourished despite the challenges of populism. History has taught us painful lessons: we were invaded by the Nazis in 1939, fell into communist totalitarianism in 1948 and suffered Soviet occupation in 1968. Not in Our Town says, “Never again. We will not be silent.” Professor Alexandra Bitušíková is a social anthropologist at Matej Bel University in Banská Bystrica, Slovakia",Alexandra Bitušíková,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The top 10 US founders and bosses of some of the world’s largest technology companies saw their finances swell to nearly $2.5tn, up from $1.9tn, in the year to Christmas Eve, according to figures from Bloomberg.

The value of his investments, equity and other assets rose $41.8bn, taking his personal fortune to $159bn. This puts him ninth in the overall , and eighth among the top 10 US tech billionaires, according to a separate report from the Financial Times. Huang sold nearly $1bn worth of shares this year, cashing in on Nvidia’s soaring stock price. Its relatively advanced computer chips are a critical component in building the more powerful processing capability required by AI. It became the world’s first $5tn company in October, larger than the economic output of some of the world’s biggest economies, such as Japan or India. The wealth of Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, swelled by around $102bn and $92bn respectively, as investors bet on the company’s AI progress, including its own in-house efforts to build new chips, known as a Tensor Processing Unit. Such has been the surge in AI investments in recent years that the Bank of England has warned of a in global markets if investor confidence proves misplaced. “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” top policymakers at the central bank said in October. This means that stock markets are “particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic”, they said. While technology is the dominant industry among gainers in the billionaire rankings, there are other familiar names, too.

For weeks, the roads have been jammed with traffic, concerts headlined by Afrobeats superstars are drawing crowds, and choice spots are filled with residents, returnees and tourists looking to indulge in the month-long enjoyment of But the spotlight is on the contents of kitchen pots as much as it is on those shuffling to the trendy This Christmas, Olawunmi George and her family of four will celebrate over and chicken at their two-bedroom apartment in Yaba, mainland Lagos. The last time the family ate the famed West African meal was in August. Since then, they have stuck to other meals such as spaghetti, rice and stew, bread and eba, among various Nigerian staples. The decision not to eat jollof rice was not out of choice but one necessitated by wracking the economy of Africa’s biggest country. “You will spend a lot for the ingredients to cook jollof rice that will be to your taste,” George, who works as a cashier, says. Jollof rice is beloved across West with each country, and each family, having its own ways of preparing it. In Nigeria, it is made with a base of tomato puree, peppers, onions, broth, margarine, curry and thyme, bayleaf and ginger, among other essentials, which is slow-cooked and stirred until the flavours coalesce before rice, often long grain, is introduced to the mix. It is often served with fried plantain and a protein of choice such as turkey, chicken or beef. A true Nigerian staple at parties and family lunch, when jollof rice is served its smoky aroma draws everybody’s attention. Today, however, the dish is appearing less on the table in Nigerian homes. The cost of preparing a pot for a family of five is 26,656 naira (£13.50), up from 21,300 naira a year ago, according to the , a cost of living report prepared by Lagos-based SBM Intelligence, which has tracked the effect of inflation on the dish since 2015. For context, the minimum monthly wage in Nigeria is 70,000 naira. Although inflation has eased for the past few months, down to %, this has barely had an impact on people’s buying power. For example, a bag of rice that sold for 120,000 naira in January now costs 65,000 naira, but most people still cannot afford it. Victor Ejechi, the head of insights at SBM Intelligence, says although inflation has slowed, it does not mean things are getting cheaper but that prices are rising more slowly than before. “What the Jollof Index captures is a widening gap between prices and purchasing power. While food inflation has eased, incomes have not adjusted at the same pace. Many Nigerians are earning the same nominal wages they earned months ago, but food now takes up a much larger share of their monthly income than it used to,” Ejechi says. Cooking jollof rice has proved too costly for Maureen Simon, a big fan of the dish. “Imagine preparing the food for a family of six, how much do you think I will be spending? I will be spending roughly 20,000 naira. And then there is chicken to add to it,” she says. She now skips many of the key ingredients such as margarine, the chicken and tomato puree. “I still try to make it taste nice with crayfish. At least, it will come out nice while making do with what I have,” the supermarket supervisor says. She uses panla, a popular cheap smoked fish, instead of chicken or beef, which contributes its own flavour. What she ends up making is an imitation of jollof she calls “concoction rice”, lighter in colour and taste but costs much less and takes less time to prepare. , a food historian, says cooking concoction rice usually begins with something the cook already has, sometimes leftover stew, and skips the luxury of slow cooking and flavour maximisation. “Overall, the concoction is likely light in colour and a bit on flavour compared with the deeper, richer flavours and notes of jollof,” she says. , where jollof rice is similarly popular, the cost of making the meal is also proving a burden for families. The Jollof Index places the cost of cooking a pot of jollof rice for a family of five at 430 cedis in a country where the daily minimum wage is 19.97 cedis. Julianna Quist, who used to make the delicacy for her family of four three times a week, now rarely cooks it. “I would rather cook normal rice and stew for the family than decide to cook jollof rice that is not good enough,” she says. The price of plantain, which Quist loves to include in her version of the dish, also went up in September. In November, after saving up, she bought a large quantity of tomatoes to ensure she could prepare the delicacy this December. The primary difference between Nigerian and Ghanaian jollof is the kind of rice used. “In Nigeria, parboiled-processed rice is common compared with non-parboiled varieties like Thai jasmine that are popular in Ghana,” says Sokoh. “There are also likely variations in method and the seasoning and spices used.” The Nigerian version is characteristically spicier and bolder. Ghana and Nigeria both claim to serve the bestin an age-old argument which now rages on social media platforms. The latest ensuing after Nigerian chef Hilda Baci attempted to for cooking the largest pot of jollof rice using 4,000kg of rice. “Notions of superiority don’t make sense – personal preference, perhaps, but claims of one version trumping the other on a serious note are ridiculous,” Sokoh says. Jollof has become enshrined in culture and identity. For many Nigerians, the dish is a core childhood memory. The shift to it becoming a luxury reshapes expectations, traditions, and how people define normalcy, experts say. Ejechi notes that when households cannot cook it freely, it reflects social strain. “The inability to prepare jollof the ‘right way’ erodes everyday cultural rituals: hosting guests, family gatherings, Sunday meals. becomes transactional rather than communal. Over time, this weakens shared social experiences that bind families and communities together,” he says. 2 medium red bell peppers, roughly chopped 1 medium red onion, roughly chopped 1/4 of a Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper Blend all the ingredients until smooth. Transfer to a pot and cover partially with a lid. Bring to the boil then reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally, until reduced by half – about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced 1 plum tomato, halved then sliced thinly crosswise In a large pot, heat two tbsps oil over medium heat. Add half the sliced onion, bay leaves, 2 tsps curry powder, dried thyme, a large pinch of salt, and a large pinch of pepper. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and the onion softens slightly – about three minutes. Stir in tomato paste and 2 tsps butter. Cook, stirring continuously, until the tomato paste darkens – about three minutes. Add in the stew base, cover partially with a lid and gently simmer until reduced by half – about 15 minutes. Stir in stock, add the remaining 2 tsps curry powder, ginger and garlic powder, and bring to a boil. Taste and adjust seasoning. Stir in rice until evenly coated in sauce. Cover the pot with a double parchment (or foil) paper, crimped down around the edges to seal, then top with lid. Reduce heat to lowest possible and cook for 20 minutes, then uncover and gently stir rice to redistribute. Cover again and continue until rice is just cooked through but still retains a firm bite and the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 15 minutes.

To my mind, a holiday shouldn’t just be a change of scenery, but an escape. An escape from routine, an escape from the everyday, an escape from the general busyness of daily life. I want to get away, switch off, unwind and return refreshed, with a renewed sense of poise and purpose. ‘I find spending time in nature to be incredibly inspiring’ While it might sound like I’m asking for a lot from my holidays, it turns out I’m far from alone. According to , three of the top five reasons people think holidays are important have to do with wellbeing. In at number one was “to relax”, with 73% of people saying this is the main reason they go away; meanwhile, 50% of respondents said that holidays are important “for my mental health and wellbeing”, while 46% said they like to get away “to escape the pressures of day-to-day life”. When you hear the phrase “wellbeing holiday” an image of an overseas retreat somewhere exotic often springs to mind. But that’s just part of the picture. There are all different types of wellbeing holidays and plenty of options closer to home, such as the – a 14th-century manor house set in more than 160 hectares (400 acres) of picturesque parkland in the countryside of south Wales.

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold. Today, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires. At the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the . In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Even in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAid – that may never be stitched back together. After Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker , by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker. Look back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself: Artificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force. Before AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of datacenters. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of datacenters wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips. More from our reporting in the last year: Elon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump More from our reporting this year: This year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media. The remarkable measure went into effect just weeks ago after a slew of legal challenges and protests from tech companies. Read some of our comprehensive reporting on the ban: In the weirdest news of 2025, the billionaire venture capitalist and conservative svengali gave a series of fevered, incoherent lectures about the antichrist and the coming of the end times. We obtained leaked audio of the talks. You can read for yourself the gibberish he uses to bend the ears of serious academics and San Francisco startup CEOs alike or, if you’d prefer not to give your attention directly to him, engage with a sharp critical interpretation by a professor hailing from the same university as Thiel’s mentor.

It was the moment photographer Doug Gimesy had been waiting for, standing in his sweaty waders on a stinking hot day, as he steadied kilos of camera equipment mere inches above the water. “It’s 35 to 40 degrees, flies buzzing around me, and I’m holding that for hours, on and off,” he says. The photograph captures the grey-headed flying fox as it skims the water’s surface and hurtles directly towards the camera. Gimesy has spent more than 160 days in the field documenting flying foxes. He has snapped all four mainland species, capturing their lives and behavioural quirks in about 50,000 images. Each zooms in on some tiny detail, such as the way the animals use their wings as sun shades, raincoats, baby blankets or cooling fans. “I find them the most incredible mammals,” he says, noting their capacity for long distance flight, their critical role as pollinators, and the way they care for and carry their young. Gimesy uses images to educate people about the magnificence of flying foxes, to get them to “engage, ask questions and understand”. “Most importantly a good photo can trigger emotions,” he says. Awe, empathy and love are especially important given flying foxes are a group that is “often misunderstood and wrongly vilified”. Habitat destruction has led to increasing overlap between flying foxes and people in Australia, with camps often located in cities and regional towns. Negative public perceptions can limit support for flying fox conservation, and sometimes lead to threats such as disturbance, harassment or illegal killing, risks identified in recovery plans for endangered “Bats rank among the world’s least understood animals,” says Dr Merlin Tuttle, who has worldwide for more than 65 years. Fear of bats and flying foxes is linked to a lack of understanding, he says, which can be amplified when photos show bats that are “frightened and snarling in self-defence”. “A picture can be absolutely essential for winning progress for bats,” Tuttle says, helping to overcome fear. “There is a dramatic difference between being told and seeing.” Tuttle’s own images, which show bats in a comical or friendly light, or performing their natural behaviours like pollinating flowers or catching insects, have played a key role in improving public attitudes. “Unless we mistreat them, most flying foxes rank among the world’s cutest animals,” he adds, and Gimesy’s work and passion for them is “unsurpassed”. Effective flying-fox conservation goes hand-in-hand with what people know about them, says Matthew Mo, a senior threatened species project officer with the NSW environment department. “For effective conservation, more people need to know flying-foxes are a normal part of our surroundings and vitally important for spreading pollen and seeds to keep forests healthy. “The more that people understand these so-called ‘sky puppies’, the more they accept them,” Mo says. “Photography allows people to get close-up, revealing that flying foxes have large eyes, a puppy-like face, and at this time of the year [spring], are mothers raising their babies.” Grey-headed flying foxes usually give birth to a single baby in spring, which they breastfeed and carry as they fly. Much like human babies, pups rely on their mothers for everything during their first five months, Many of Gimesy’s images emphasise this maternal bond. The one he calls “baby on board” took more than 30 days of photographing between dusk and dawn. For the image to work, the baby had to be visible, the wing in the right position. “That’s technically really hard because they’re travelling at speed in the dark – it’s normally dusk or dawn so the lighting is not great – and you’re trying to get focus,” he says. But the effort was worth it, says Gimesy, for the emotional response when people see it. The power of the image to influence hearts and minds is the reason Gimesy, who initially trained in zoology and has qualifications in environment and bioethics, shifted his focus to wildlife welfare photography. He highlights the threats facing flying foxes and the people willing to help. One shows an animal caught in fruit tree netting. Another depicts Melbourne veterinarian Sarah Frith assisting a suffering young pup found collapsed at the base of a tree during a heat stress event. “We know that bats represent 20% of mammals, and they spend so much time in the air doing things that help us, but we don’t give them that much air time,” Gimesy says. It’s an oversight he hopes to correct. The fact that his book Life Upside Down (Australian Geographic, $19.95), which details the lives and challenges facing grey-headed flying foxes, can be found in a third of school libraries is one of his proudest achievements. “One of the things about flying foxes is most people never get to see them up close,” Gimesy says. When they get that opportunity, he hopes, they might just fall in love.",Petra Stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/11/orca-killer-whale-dolphin-hunt-salmon-study-british-columbia-canada,"Orcas team up with dolphins to hunt salmon, study finds",2025-12-11T16:00:18.000Z,"Northern resident killer whales appear to use dolphins as ‘scouts’, in a  surprising cooperative hunting strategy have been spotted for the first time working as a team to hunt salmon off the coast of British Columbia, according to a new study which suggests a cooperative relationship between the two predators. The research, published on Thursday in the journal , shows interactions between northern resident orcas (also known as killer whales) and Pacific white-sided dolphins are not just chance encounters while foraging. Extensive documentation, including drone video, acoustic recordings and underwater footage, led scientists working with the University of British Columbia, the Leibniz Institute and the Hakai Institute, to conclude the two species are working as a team. “These whales are top salmon hunting specialists. They’re highly specialised and highly skilled predators. To see them following dolphins as though they were leaders was really counterintuitive – and really exciting,” said Sarah Fortune, a marine scientist at Dalhousie University and the report’s lead author. Dolphins have often been spotted close to the , an ecotype of the apex predator that subsists almost entirely on Chinook salmon. Dolphins lack the ability to hunt salmon, which are too big for them, normally relying on herring. Video footage in the research shows the dolphins – which Fortune said act as “scouts” – cutting seamlessly through the glassy waters of the Pacific in pursuit of the salmon, which can reach nearly three feet in length. The orcas follow closely behind. When the whales catch their prey and break them apart at the surface to share with other orcas, the dolphins scavenged the leftovers. The whales, which are typically fiercely protective of freshly hunted prey, seem unbothered by the intrusion. Researchers examined multiple explanations for the proximity of the dolphins and the lack of aggression by the orcas. One theory suggested the dolphins were simply obtaining protection in the presence of the whales. Northern resident orcas do not prey on the dolphins, but Bigg’s orcas, which share the same waters, do. But the distinct ecotypes of whales largely avoid each other. Another theory was the dolphins obtained benefits by bow riding near the orcas, reducing drag. The team also weighed the possibility of kleptoparasitism, a term that refers to dolphins stealing scraps of food from the whales. “If the dolphins were parasites, just there for a free lunch, the whales might act aggressively towards them to get them to leave – or the killer whales themselves might leave and go feed in adjacent areas. But we really didn’t see evidence of antagonistic behaviours between species. And that really surprised us,” said Fortune. That left the researchers with the last and most tantalising explanation: the two predators were cooperating. “The killer whales were orienting themselves to follow the dolphins, and so the dolphins appeared to be in a leadership role,” said Fortune. “This really sparked our interest to look further into our data and try to see if we could figure out what was really going on.” To better study the hunt, three members of the team crammed into a small boat and tagged the whales with a large carbon fibre pole, attaching a camera with a suction cup that would eventually fall off. The tags, which recorded video and acoustics, continuously recorded dive data, along with vocalisations and feeding-related sounds, gave researchers a rare glimpse into interactions more than 100ft below the surface. Because the dolphins were so close to the whales, the tags often picked up the vocalisations of both mammals. “We’d often see this alternating pattern, where our tagged whale would echolocate, and then there’d be a period of silence, and the we’d hear dolphin echolocation clicks, and so those dolphins had to be close enough to the hydrophone that we could pick it up,” said Fortune. “And this raises a question: are both species listening to each other? Are they eavesdropping?” Fortune said the simultaneous echolocation by the two species also raised the prospect they could effectively increase the acoustic field of view, given the whales have a wide range to track fish. The team said more study is needed to determine the extent at which both species are benefiting from this interaction. “Is it that there is going to be something beneficial to both the dolphins and the killer whales,” said Fortune. “Do whales that hunt with dolphins end up as more successful at foraging than those that hunt without dolphins?” But the study has also reshaped and expanded the understanding of what whales and dolphins, both known for their intelligence, are capable of while hunting. “Most people are aware that killer whales have strong culture, and that they’re a very social species and specialised hunting strategies,” said Fortune. “But as social as they are, when it comes time to hunt and to catch salmon, they turn into lone wolves. To see them likely cooperatively hunting with another species shows how adaptable they are to changing and refining their hunting strategy.”",Leyland Cecco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mild winter followed by an exceptionally warm spring prompted to take up residence along England’s south coast, from Penzance in Cornwall to south Devon. “The scale of the catch [recorded by local fishers] was of the order of about 13 times what we would normally expect in Cornish waters,” said Matt Slater, a marine conservation officer at Wildlife Trust. “When we added up the numbers, approximately 233,000 octopuses were caught in UK waters this year – that’s a huge increase from what you would normally expect.” , is native to UK waters but ordinarily in such small numbers it is rarely seen. A sudden increase in the population – a bloom – is caused by a combination of a mild winter followed by a warm breeding season in the spring. The ideal conditions meant that more of the larvae of the common octopus were likely to survive, said Slater, possibly in part fuelled by the that have also been recorded along the south coast in recent years. The last time an octopus bloom of the size observed in 2025 was recorded was 1950, with showing the last bloom recorded prior to that was in 1900. The huge numbers of octopuses along the south coast meant they could be easily spotted in shallow waters for the first time in recent history. Video footage from divers shows octopuses gathering in groups – they are usually solitary – as well as “walking” along the seabed on the tips of their limbs. One was even filmed grabbing at an underwater camera. “The first time I dived off the Lizard peninsula this year I saw five octopuses,” said Slater. “And these are big. There are two types of octopus in UK waters. There is the curled octopus, which is quite small, only getting to about the size of a football, but these common octopuses can be up to a metre and a half wide.” Another mild winter going into 2026 meant it was possible there could be a second bloom next year, said Slater, because historically, under these conditions, the blooms have repeated themselves for two consecutive years. “However, it is unlikely, based on past events, that it will go on for a long time,” he said. “But the sea keeps giving us surprises at the moment so it’s quite an unpredictable situation.” The Wildlife Trusts noted some of the other “surprises, successes and joyful moments” around the UK coastline included a record number of grey seals observed by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust, as well as record numbers of puffins on Skomer, an island off the coast of Wales famed for the birds. Other wildlife was recorded in unusual places. A volunteer with Shoresearch, the Wildlife Trusts’ sea slug in Yorkshire, a 12mm mollusc that resembles a gnarly root vegetable and is usually found in the south-west. In addition, a variable blenny, a Mediterranean fish, was discovered off the coast of Sussex for the first time. Populations had previously been limited to the West Country. Not everything was good news, though. “The year was bookended by environmental disasters,” said Ruth Williams, head of marine conservation at the Wildlife Trusts. “[There was] the in March and in November the off the Sussex coast.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/survived-wildfires-drought-killing-greece-fir-forests-aoe,They survived wildfires. But something else is killing Greece’s iconic fir forests,2025-12-19T05:00:52.000Z,"In the Peloponnese mountains, the usually hardy trees are turning brown even where fires haven’t reached. Experts are raising the alarm on a complex crisis n the southern Peloponnese, the Greek fir is a towering presence. The deep green, slow-growing conifers have long defined the region’s high-altitude forests, thriving in the mountains and rocky soils. For generations they have been one of the country’s hardier species, unusually capable of withstanding drought, insects and the wildfires that periodically sweep through Mediterranean ecosystems. These Greek forests have lived with fire for as long as anyone can remember. So when Dimitrios Avtzis, a senior researcher at the Forest Research Institute (FRI) of Elgo-Dimitra, was dispatched to document the aftermath of a spring blaze in the region, nothing about the assignment seemed exceptional. He had walked into countless burnt landscapes, tracking the expected pockets of mortality, as well as the trees that survived their scorching. This time, however, something felt wrong almost immediately. The scale was off. As Avtzis and his colleagues moved deeper into the trees, the familiar sights of a post-fire forest gave way to something far more unsettling. “There were hundreds upon hundreds of hectares worth of lost trees,” he says – not just those lost in the fire itself, but large patches dead and dying among the green, where the flames had not reached them. In the Peloponnese mountains, whole stretches of green forest are turning orange, as the long-lived fir trees dry up and die. The level of destruction was so far beyond what Avtzis had seen in previous years, it forced him to immediately contact the environment ministry and raise the alarm. “The scale of the damage was profound,” he says. Researchers across Greece and central Europe have warned for years that climate breakdown will push local ecosystems into unfamiliar territory. Wildfires are not new: according to data from the , between 2001 and 2024, Greece lost 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) of trees to fires. But fires are not the only thing killing trees, and the forces shaping wildfire aftermath have shifted dramatically in the past five years. What Avtzis saw was the result of multiple pressures stacking on top of one another, each amplified by the climate crisis. The first is severe, prolonged drought, now a defining feature of Greece’s climate. The dryness is compounded by a steady decline in winter snow. A study by the Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development and the National Observatory of Athens found that between 1991 and 2020, Greece lost an average of , eroding one of the country’s most important sources of slow-release moisture. Then comes the biological fallout. Drought-degraded soils and shrinking groundwater leave fir trees weakened, creating an opening for insects. “We know that severe drought weakens the trees,” Avtzis says. “But when we looked more closely at what was happening, we found bark beetles had taken advantage. They were attacking the trees.” Bark beetles – particularly those in the Scolytinae subfamily – have emerged as a growing threat to Greece’s already stressed forests over the past two years. Their name is owed to the fact that the insects bore beneath the outer bark, cutting into the systems trees rely on to transport water and nutrients. Once they establish themselves inside drought-stressed firs, their numbers can rise rapidly. “When a population reaches outbreak levels,” Avtzis says, “it becomes extremely difficult to bring it back under control.” The phenomenon is not confined to Greece. Bark beetle outbreaks have become a wider European concern, Avtzis says, mirroring patterns seen elsewhere on the continent. “Southern may be more vulnerable,” he says, “but we’re observing similar dynamics in countries like Spain.” – indicating that the drivers behind the Peloponnese die-offs are not local anomalies, but symptoms of a broader ecological shift. Yet amid the accelerating pressures of the climate crisis, there are cautious notes of optimism. Nikos Markos, a forest climatologist at FRI, points to the regenerative capacity of Mediterranean ecosystems. “Post-fire regeneration can be quite satisfactory,” he says, “even in some areas of the Peloponnese.” Recovery, however, is slow and uneven. “It is not something we can see in the first year,” Markos adds. “It may take four or five years.” Avtzis is pragmatic when he speaks about what it will take to protect Greece’s highland forests. “I’m going to be realistic,” he says. “The government and the ministries have to take the initiative and mobilise the necessary funding to confront this problem.” Some steps, he notes, were already beginning by the time he had submitted his report on the Peloponnese. “They contacted the major regional forest services and asked how much funding was needed,” he says. “What really matters now is whether those plans are actually put into action.” Asked whether Greece’s shifting meteorological patterns are likely to keep accelerating, and whether that poses an existential risk for southern Europe’s forests, Avtzis pauses. “There is no time to be pessimistic,” he says. “But we have a lot of work to do.” The tools, he says, already exist. “We have the knowledge. We have the scientists. Now, we need to start going out and talking about this,” he says. “Because what we’re seeing now is only going to become more frequent and more intense.”",Tam Patachako,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It changed my life, but one relationship marked me like no other n 2022, I had a job at an estate agents in Paris selling ridiculously expensive flats, and decided I needed to do something more meaningful with my life. I resigned, and six months later arrived in In hindsight I was a young kid, full of anger, not happy with his life. That 26-year-old is definitely not me now – and it was living with primates that changed my life. I ended up at the Chimpanzee Centre, a five-hour drive from the nearest town in the middle of the jungle. I lived in a cabin surrounded by 66 chimpanzees and my job was to care for them. The chimps would constantly erupt with these “hoo hooo” noises in the night. One would start and then they’d all be at it. I miss that nightly racket now. I was only supposed to go for three months, but ended up staying for 11. Living in that cabin, I was fully alone for the first time – and completely immersed in watching these animals. The thing that fascinated me most about chimps was how they processed anger. They can fight really hard – hit each other, steal food from each other – but they always make peace about five minutes later. I have made peace with myself and with people I felt hate for. I learned from these primates there is no point being angry or living in the past. I came to accept and welcome my emotions like chimps do: when they are afraid they just scream, when they’re happy they do a different kind of scream. They don’t control it, and it’s so nice to see – especially if they are about to get food. It’s like little kids at Christmas. I live with my emotions much more easily now than I did before. One relationship marked me more than any other, and that was with a baby sooty mangabey called Elio. He was a handful and required constant care – someone to feed him, comfort him and help him learn to explore his surroundings – a bit like a human child. These monkeys are vulnerable to extinction in the wild. I think his parents had been poached. Tiny babies are not worth anything as bushmeat, so the poachers sometimes kill the family and take the babies alive or just abandon them. All the primates at the sanctuary were there for this reason. What marked me the most was how human he looked (especially his hands and feet), he had this amazing pinky face and wonderful look in his eye. For the first three days, I spent the entire day in the cabin with him to gain his trust. He was jumping around everywhere, then he started jumping on me. He came over and offered his back, legs and arms to be groomed, just like he would have with his parents. Every day at 7am I got him his fruit and a bottle of milk and then we would wander around camp. We had two or three different spots we particularly liked. I would sit and read books or play Sudoku and he would go into the trees, jumping from one to the other, and sometimes chasing the wild vervet monkeys. The minute I started walking away he would follow. I was with him the whole time and did everything I could to make his days happy. A bond had been created – it was an amazing moment for me. I learned I could be patient. He taught me that I’m ready to be a dad – and this meant a lot to me, because I have always had a difficult relationship with my own father. After two months, we got news that it was time to move Elio to a wildlife centre in Liberia where he could be with other mangabeys. I knew it was the best thing for him – he was growing up – but it was extremely hard to say goodbye. The director from the centre saw how attached to him I was and promised they would take good care of him, and that he would have friends. They had a release programme, so he could possibly live in the wild one day. About a year after I’d left him, I had a dream about Elio, and so I asked them how he was doing and was told he had died of an infection. It broke my heart. I consider him my first son. Thanks to Elio, though, I finally found my purpose, which I definitely did not do selling ridiculously expensive flats in Paris. There is nothing in that can bring as much meaning as being with chimpanzees and monkeys, and taking care of them. It was Elio who taught me this. He made me join the fight against poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. I think about him a lot. I have a tattoo of him on my arm, so in a way he comes everywhere with me.",Phoebe Weston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/04/joe-macinnis-canada-ocean-exploration-shipwrecks-leadership-treasure-diving-titanic,"A diving prince, sunken treasure and snared by the Titanic: Joe MacInnis on his ‘rip-roaring’ life as an ocean adventurer",2025-12-04T14:00:21.000Z,"At 88, the Canadian reflects on a golden era of underwater discovery and how shipwrecks and the cruel sea are the ‘greatest of all teachers’ oe MacInnis admits there are simply too many places to begin telling the story of life in the ocean depths. At 88, the famed Canadian undersea explorer, has many decades to draw on. There was the time he and a Russian explorer and deep-water pilot, Anatoly Sagalevich, were snagged by a telephone wire strung from the pilot house of the Titanic, trapping the pair two and a half miles below the surface. Another might be the moment he and his team stared in disbelief through a porthole window at the Edmund Fitzgerald, the 222-metre (729ft) ship that vanished 50 years ago , so quickly that none of the crew could issue a call for help. MacInnis and his team were the first humans to lay eyes on the wreck. It could also be the time he led an expedition in the Canadian high Arctic, battling unforgiving ice to locate a lost British vessel crushed by those same elements. Or, when diving in waters off the Florida Keys “humming with history”, he passed a pod of lobsters clustered in a reef that was composed entirely of 16th-century silver bars from a Spanish galleon. But for MacInnis, a doctor, diver and writer, the place to start is simple: the shipwrecks themselves, moments when worlds were torn apart by the raw power of the ocean. The ships have helped him better understand the natural world and, increasingly, himself. MacInnis diving in Lake Huron, off Tobermory, , in 1969. Photograph: Don Dutton/Toronto Star/Getty Images “In the final arc of your life, you start thinking of shipwrecks differently and they become a metaphor for understanding the forces of the world,” he says from his Toronto home. “Because, above all, they help us grapple with one of the toughest things that we have to do as humans: to reckon with the reality that we’re mortal. “Death is coming for us, but it gives life an unexpected beauty and a deep sense of urgency,” MacInnis adds. Nearly all of the space on the planet where life can exist – and yet it remains the least explored part of Earth. Still, those who spend their lives enveloped by the timelessness of the oceans experience a power that has coaxed explorers to risk their lives for a chance to unspool the smallest of its mysteries. Among those on the leading edge of discovery, few have encountered as many giants as MacInnis, whose career dovetailed with a golden age of undersea exploration. “I worked alongside pioneers and I saw what was possible,” he says of an era that, alongside friendships with Jacques Cousteau, Robert Ballard and Buzz Aldrin, included a secretive US navy project to see if humans could live deep underwater. “But I also saw the unforgiving nature of the ocean. I saw injury and death. In the final arc of my life, I want to take what I’ve learned from it and share. It will always be the greatest of all teachers.” MacInnis, described in a 1971 issue of Popular Mechanics as a “a rip-roaring, life-loving young Canadian”, has long been one of the ocean’s most eager students. He was the first to dive at the north pole and the team he led was both the first to build a polar dive station – – and the first to film narwhal, bowhead and beluga whales underwater. He took Canada’s former prime minister Pierre Trudeau diving in the Arctic. He also , who was then aged 26, under the ice.

Photographs: Dmitry Kostyukov/AFP/Getty; PA MacInnis was involved with the French and American team that . Later, he was part of a Canadian-Russian expedition to film a documentary about the wreck. During the final dive, he and the submersible pilot Sagalevich were momentarily trapped atop the ship. He remains convinced that those years of collaboration between nations, in the pursuit of science, were a “tiny step” in the collapse of the cold war and the coming breakdown of the Berlin Wall. “Here we were, working on science together in the ocean with two cold war enemies. And I think that reflects what shipwrecks have taught me: in moments of crisis, we need each other. We’re in this together; none of us is as good as all of us.” In 1980, five years before the Titanic was discovered, he led a Canadian expedition to locate HMS Breadalbane – one of the ships dispatched in 1853 to help in the search for , lost on Sir John Franklin’s doomed expedition to The discovery of HMS Breadalbane made it the northernmost wreck ever found. MacInnis later sought out the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, a wreck preserved by the cold, clear waters of Lake Superior on the borders of Canada and the US, as well as “Does anyone know where the love of God goes,” wrote Lightfoot. “When the waves turn the minutes to hours?” The question posed by Lightfoot in what MacInnis called “the song for all shipwrecks” captures the intense focus of the explorer, whose passion in recent years has drifted away from the science and technology behind the wrecks, and more towards the human psychology of them. “When the world is ripped out from you, when it’s shredded before your eyes, how do you react? For me, wrecks have always been about the people who survived – or those that didn’t. Because in our own lives, we can at times find ourselves scrambling to get to shore,” he says. “I like to say that after years in the ocean, I’m an alpha coward with a PhD in fear.” The freighter Edmund Fitzgerald, pictured in 1959, was lost in a storm on Lake Superior in 1975. Photograph: AP Braiding together ideas of fear, chaos and decision-making has given MacInnis an outlet for his energy. His most recent book is about leadership and he has grown increasingly fixated on the relationship between wrecks, survival and the global polycrisis – a term – that captures the challenges of geopolitical chaos and climate crisis. “I am old and when you think about the ships, the subs and the planes I used, my carbon footprint is enormous. This is why I’m on fire right now, to do what I can to help.” MacInnis recently suffered a heart attack and a minor stroke – and with it an uncomfortable glimpse of his own mortality. “My soft pink body, with its 2,000 moving parts and 100,000 biochemical reactions, is slowly falling apart. I don’t have the sharpness I used to. “I’m frantically trying to put together my own lifeboat with the help of some wonderful people. But I know the shore lies at an infinite distance from where I am. For the first time, really, I’m in my own shipwreck.” His home has numerous items from the deep sea, including a piece of foam from the submersible used – and signed – by James Cameron to reach the deepest place in the ocean. “To Dr Joe MacInnis,” it reads. “Legend, mentor, shipmate … friend.” Clockwise from top: MacInnis with the film-maker James Cameron; a rusty link from HMS Bounty’s anchor chain; and holding a signed piece of Cameron’s submersible.

Measuring nearly four inches long, it comes from the wreck of HMS Bounty – a story of maritime disaster that captivated him as a young explorer – and one that he now realises he misunderstood. In 1789, the acting lieutenant, Fletcher Christian, led a mutiny against the . Put into an open launch with a few loyal crew, the captain navigated more than 3,600 nautical miles (6,600km) from Tonga to safety in Timor. The mutineers eventually sailed “I thought of it as a story of mutiny. There were clear villains and heroes. And yet now, when I think about the crew and Christian, travelling so far on the open ocean, I see it as an incredible story of survival and leadership,” says MacInnis. “And so there’s a sense of hope that comes from shipwreck, from the lifeboats we find ourselves in. It’s not a wishy-washy hope; it’s hope in action, it’s doing the right thing.” MacInnis says a life spent alongside people looking to push the upper limits of human possibility has instilled within him a relentless optimism. “If enough of us can get together and put the planet ahead of ourselves, we’ve got a chance with this.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/invasive-quagga-mussels-lake-geneva-aoe,‘It’s an open invasion’: how millions of quagga mussels changed Lake Geneva for ever,2025-12-18T05:00:29.000Z,"The molluscs are decimating food chains in Switzerland, have devastated the Great Lakes in North America, and this week were spotted in Northern Ireland for the first time ike cholesterol clogging up an artery, it took just a couple of years for the quagga mussels to infiltrate the 5km (3-mile) highway of pipes under the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL). By the time anyone realised what was going on, it was too late. The power of some heat exchangers had dropped by a third, blocked with ground-up shells. The air conditioning faltered, and buildings that should have been less than 24C in the summer heat couldn’t get below 26 to 27C. The invasive mollusc had infiltrated pipes that suck cold water from a depth of 75 metres (250ft) in Lake Geneva to cool buildings. “It’s an open invasion,” says Mathurin Dupanier, utilities operations manager at EPFL. But the damage went far beyond keeping classrooms cool. The university’s datacentres need to be chilled, and long-running experiments cannot tolerate temperature fluctuations. “Research is one of the things we do; if it stops, then the school closes,” says Dupanier. The institute is also home to Tokamak – an experimental nuclear fusion facility that looks to create clean energy from the same process that powers the sun. That, too, needs to be cooled – otherwise it will melt. Quagga mussels are among the planet’s most potent invasive species. They reproduce at astonishing speed: one female quagga produces up to . Some are known to survive for 30 years in the deepest parts of American lakes. They can breed all year round, and spawn in temperatures as low as 5C. Dupanier’s team were shocked when they discovered the extent of the invasion in 2022. “We had this denial about what was happening,” he says. The quaggas had only been detected in Lake Geneva and already they had spread like wildfire. Mathurin Dupanier indicates the water cooling systems that were blocked by the invasive quagga mussels. Photographs: Phoebe Weston/the Guardian; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne The threats to pieces of infrastructure such as Tokamak illustrate the possible scope of their impact. Losing air cooling there will not result in a nuclear explosion, but equipment will go into shutdown. Now, any activity that uses cold water from the depths of the lake is at risk. Drinking water in Geneva and Lausanne is potentially threatened because the pumping and filtration systems are in the quagga zone. The airport – which uses the same water cooling system as the university – has also been hit. “All of them have this issue around the lake; there is no exception,” says Dupanier. The only way for EPFL and the University of Lausanne to protect their pipes is to build a new closed-loop, quagga-free cooling system. Construction will start in 2027 and should take five years. Dupanier says it will be a race against time to keep precious research going before the quaggas choke their systems any further. From a floating research station on Lake Geneva, the lake looks as it always has, with snow-capped mountains tumbling into its dark waters. Over the past decade, however, ecologists know this lake has changed profoundly. “The surface is just a tiny part of the 300 metres below us,” says Bastiaan Ibelings, a professor in ecology at the University of Geneva. Bastiaan Ibelings, professor of microbial ecology at the University of Geneva A chain hauled from beneath Lake Geneva is covered in invasive quagga mussels. Photographs: Jordi Ruiz Cirera/the Guardian To illustrate the extent of the changes, technicians pull a chain up from the depths. It is encrusted in quagga mussels, like diamonds on gaudy costume jewellery. The base of the food chain that feeds this entire ecosystem has completely changed: snails, shrimps and native mussels that you might have found previously are nowhere to be seen. Even after 100 metres of chain, quaggas are still being hauled out of the water. “It is too late for this lake,” says Ibelings. “It’s like a meadow of quaggas down there. Every spot is taken. Instead of seeing sand you see quagga mussels.” In Lake Geneva the molluscs have reached a record-breaking depth of 250 metres – a pitch-dark environment where there is almost no oxygen, home to scant life other than microbes. Their ability to survive where other species can’t means they grow uncontrollably in Alpine lakes. For a long time, the invasion was not very visible to the public, says Ibelings, but now people are noticing something is not right. Dead mussels wash up on beaches, and people can’t walk barefoot because they cut themselves. Recreational boaters have to scrape them off their craft every few months. Crayfish are covered in mussels and dying because they can’t move. Quaggas originate from the Ponto-Caspian region of the Black Sea and were spread around the world . They invaded North America’s Great Lakes in 1989 and are now the dominant life form, making up of all invertebrate biomass in some lakes. In the US, they have driven a collapse in the region’s fish populations, with lawmakers warning they will need to address the issue. Great Lake shipwrecks – preserved in pristine condition for more than 100 years – are now This week, they were detected in Northern Ireland for the first time, with the country’s environment minister, Andrew Muir, warning that “increased vigilance and surveillance” was critical. Quagga mussels cover the wreck of Kyle Spangler in Thunder Bay national marine sanctuary on Lake Huron in Michigan, US. Photograph: Joseph Hoyt/NOAA The mussels were first detected in Switzerland in 2014. The highest density was found in Lake Geneva, with an average of 4,000 quagga mussels a square metre across the whole lake. In some places there were more than 35,000 a square metre. In 2022, researchers found 98.9% of samples were quagga mussels, and survey, they exclusively scooped up quagga mussels – nothing else. “Quaggas were 100% of samples,” says Salomé Boudet, a PhD student at the University of Geneva, who led the study. Mussel biomass in Lake Geneva is now comparable to what has been found in the Great Lakes, researchers say. Globally, invasive species such as these are one of the five main drivers of biodiversity decline. The ecological knock-on effects in Swiss lakes will play out in the coming years. Each mussel can filter up to a day, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, which forms the basis of the lake food chain. Tiny creatures such as water flea feed on phytoplankton, and then fish feed on the water flea. When the base of the chain disappears, it has cascading impacts on the entire food web, and potentially severe impacts on the livelihood of the 120 professional fishers working on Lake Geneva. Data is gathered from a floating research laboratory on Lake Geneva Scientists are working to track changes in the lake and model ecological processes. Photographs: Jordi Ruiz Cirera/the Guardian The filtering activity of quaggas also results in the water being clearer, which means light penetrates deeper. Like climate breakdown, this can lead to warmer water reaching deeper, with knock-on effects including an increase in toxic blue-green algal blooms. Previously, cold air from the atmosphere created lake currents, resulting in the mixing of water, but this hasn’t happened since 2012. Once quagga mussels are in a lake there is nothing you can do, other than stop them colonising other lakes by cleaning boats and fishing equipment. After thousands of years of stability, Lake Geneva is undergoing a period of huge and irreversible change in the space of just a decade. In the American and Canadian lakes, there are no signs of quagga populations falling after 30 years of colonisation. Ibelings says: “Going back is a fairytale, because of quagga mussels and climate change. We cannot control either, and I don’t think they will go away. We need to understand what they are doing to the lake.” In the future it is possible that nature will evolve, and some fish may adapt to eat quagga mussels, but ecologists say Lake Geneva will never be the same. “We need to accept at some point, whatever is there – this is a different lake, now,” says Ibelings.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/23/how-swizerland-learned-to-live-with-beavers-rewilding-aoe,Something gnawed your oak tree? Sink hole in your road? How Zurich’s beaver hotline is reassuring residents,2025-12-23T09:00:52.000Z,"As the number of the semi-aquatic creatures soars so can tensions. But the Swiss have a tried and tested system to calm the neighbours and restore harmony hate beavers,” a woman tells the beaver hotline. Forty years ago she planted an oak tree in a small town in southern Zurich – now at the frontier of beaver expansion – and it has just been felled: gnawed by the large, semi-aquatic rodents as they enter their seasonal home-improvement mode. The caller is one of 10 new people getting in touch each week at this time of year. Beavers, nature’s great engineers, can unleash mayhem during winter as they renovate their lodges and build up their dams. For people, this can mean flooding, sinkholes appearing in roads and trees being felled. A single incident can clock up 70,000 Swiss francs (£65,000) in damages. To cope, the beaver-rich canton of Zurich came up with the hotline. The local is staffed by ecologists who give advice, assess damages and evaluate potential compensation (the oak tree-bereft woman is advised to wrap wire around the base of the other trees to stop the rodents’ chewing). Part of the job is calming down people furious at their beaver neighbours. “Some farmers are so angry you can hardly understand them, but they calm down when you go and see them,” says first responder Caroline Nienhuis, a biologist from Fornat, the consultancy that runs the hotline. Switzerland is experiencing a beaver boom. When top predators first recolonise a former habitat – such as when wolves, bears and eagles across Europe – the immediate reaction is often one of awe. As the animals spread, however, it can often lead to conflict. Population growth is usually slow when you first introduce a new species, then it moves exponentially. In 2008, there were 1,600 beavers, and in 2022 (when the last full monitoring was done) there were 4,900, with numbers likely to have increased since. What is striking about the Swiss example is the degree to which citizens accept living alongside them. Unlike in most European countries, no beaver has been legally killed in since they were reintroduced in 1956. The Swiss approach is not hands-off in its rewilding: its success lies in extensive state management and support. Up to 1m Swiss francs (£930,000) can be allocated each year for beaver damage and prevention – the biggest such fund in Peter Roos is a public works employee who maintains waterways, roads, streets and paths in the municipality of Hettlingen, home to 3,200 people – and now, a number of beavers. Roos says he calls the hotline up to 20 times a year. The local beavers’ latest trick has been raising the height of their dam – an enterprise that risks flooding the sewage system. Discussing it on site, Nienhuis and Roos agree that the dam needs to be lowered to sort the problem out. The whole decision takes about 30 minutes. “It’s about who’s got more patience: man or beaver?” says Roos. “Once you start manipulating their dams they get inventive and build new dams.” His latest task is to investigate a sinkhole that appeared in the local car park, which the wheel of a lorry fell into. “To keep beaver activity in check is a huge amount of work,” says Roos. Some argue that this proves large beaver populations are with large human populations. In Bavaria, are shot a year, which is 10% of the population, but the number continues to grow. Poland issues permits to cull of its beaver population each year (about 8,300 individuals). But the effectiveness of culling is questioned in Switzerland. If a river section is favourable for one beaver, it is likely to be favourable for others. “It’s efficient to shoot a beaver – but only until the next beaver comes along,” says Nienhuis. “Then the same conflicts arise.” Nienhuis says prevention and compensation are more effective. “It’s important people feel they can control beavers and their activity so they accept them. As soon as you lose acceptance from the local people it’s a problem,” she says. The biologist believes animals such as beavers, wolves and lynx should not be reintroduced without a system to deal with conflicts that inevitably arise. “If you say ‘deal with it yourself’ that is when illegal shooting happens.” The costs of management are more than compensated for by the wildlife and ecosystem benefits beavers bring. Despite causing flooding in some areas, they reduce it in others as their dams slow the flow of water through the landscape, protecting communities downstream from flash floods. “We cannot build what they do. We would miss a huge opportunity if we went and shot them all,” says Cécile Auberson, who works for a national Beaver Centre (Nationale Biberfachstelle). They are, she says, the “most powerful force in river restoration”. Marthalen is the largest beaver wetland in Switzerland and ecologists point to it as an illustration of why people should put up with them. In 2011, a family of beavers moved into the plantation and dammed the small stream that runs through it, transforming four hectares into an alluvial forest, submerging old oak trees and felling others. There has been an explosion of biodiversity in this swampy area. Calls of the black woodpecker and tawny owl reverberate about the woodland. It is a case study in how wild engineering by beavers can reshape ecosystems in the space of a few years. “The effects on biodiversity are just huge. No human-led projects would ever achieve those benefits,” says Auberson. up to six times more species of fish, amphibians, water insects, water plants and dragonflies, and up to 60 times more abundance than in the same rivers without beaver activities. “What the beaver can do and how this impacts nature is mind-blowing. It makes you realise how unnatural a lot of our nature is,” says Nienhuis. Beavers are now doing free river restoration work on 2,000km of river in Switzerland they have already colonised. “If we integrate them intelligently they can save us money, and do it better than we can,” says Auberson. Some areas are already managing their future of coexistence. Two years ago, beavers moved into the stream running through the village of Uhwiesen. In January 2024, after some extensive burrowing, a sink hole appeared in the road, and the following year there was another. The beavers felled 20 trees, turning the riverside bald. They had an appetite for the farmers’ sugar beets and brussels sprouts. Water levels were rising due to their dam building. “I was worried about flooding of the tennis courts and people’s homes,” says Oliver Kuhn, who is in charge of local maintenance in Uhwiesen. The damage was averted by the construction of a netted beaver boundary, which cost 8,000 Swiss francs, shared between the municipality and the canton. Now, most locals are fond of their new neighbours. Kuhn, who named the beavers Justin and Hailey ( , pronounced “bee-ber” is German for beaver), has noticed kingfishers have come back since they arrived, as well as more dragonflies and bats. “People see it as a bit exotic and unique that we’ve got beavers here. You can walk along here with your dog and see beavers – that’s special,” says Andi Pfenninger, who lives in Uhwiesen. “People see it as an enrichment of where they live.”",Phoebe Weston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Someone on the boat bobbing at a distance offshore passes round a pair of binoculars and yes! – there it is. It’s a huge Mediterranean monk seal, , which at up to 2.8 metres and over 300kg (660lbs), is also one of the world’s largest types of seal. Piperi, where the seal has come ashore, is a strictly guarded island in the National Marine Park of Alonissos and Northern Sporades, Greece’s largest marine protected area (MPA) and a critical breeding habitat for the seals. Only researchers are allowed within three miles of its shores, with permission from the government’s Natural Environment and Climate Change Agency. With a global population of under 1,000 individuals, , reclassified from endangered in 2023, after decades of conservation efforts helped raise numbers. According to the , Greece is home to about 500 monk seals (up from 250 in the 1990s), , so has a uniquely important role to play in the future of these rare mammals. This seems fitting given that seals were once thought to have been under the protection of mythical gods Poseidon and Apollo and so have a special place in Greek culture. Monk seals have been hunted in the Mediterranean since prehistoric times for their pelts, meat and blubber. While this threat has receded in Greece, others – – have not. Now, according to conservationists, a very modern peril is growing exponentially and putting that fragile recovery at risk: Greece’s burgeoning marine leisure industry. Unregulated tourism is on a mammal that is sensitive to human disturbance, say wildlife groups. This summer several initiatives were implemented to turn this around, including , a national education campaign. At about the same time, the islet of Formicula, a key seal habitat in the Ionian Sea, was shielded ahead of the busy summer season by a strict 200-metre no entry zone. In October, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, confirmed two large-scale MPAs are to go ahead. If properly managed (and so far the management structure is unclear), these MPAs could offer a lifeline to the species. Back on the waters around Piperi, Angelos Argiriou, a freelance warden and marine biologist, points as the boat passes a shore monitored by camera. “We often see the seals resting on this beach,” he says. “The fact that they feel safe enough to haul out [rest] here in the open is a really good sign that the protection measures are working.” Seals began to be protected in Greece in the late 1980s, by MOm, which has rescued more than 40 orphaned or injured seals to date. “Our rehab centre has really helped the recovery of the species,” says MOm’s president, Panos Dendrinos. “Last year, we saw a rehabilitated female with a new pup. If you save one female, she might have 20 pups in her lifetime.” but many moved into caves relatively recently because of human pressure. Although pupping caves might have provided shelter from people, they have often proved an unsuitable habitat in which to raise young – violent surf can smash them against rocks, drown them or sweep them out to sea. And caves no longer provide reliable hiding places. Once-remote coastlines are now accessible to everyone from day trippers on hired boats to private yachts anchored in the seals’ habitat. “A week after giving birth, monk seal mothers go fishing, leaving their pup alone for hours,” says Dendrinos. “If someone goes inside, the pup is liable to panic and abandon the cave; its mother is unlikely to find it.” After 40 years of monitoring the Alonissos MPA, Dendrinos says his society “now see seals using open beaches systemically”. s another key habitat for seals, Formicula will be part of the new Ionian MPA. The islet is at the heart of one of the world’s busiest sailing grounds but unlike its better-known neighbours, Meganisi and Cephalonia, it did not appear much on the tourist radar until recently. explains how tourism has taken its toll on the area. “Six, seven, eight years ago we had encounters almost every day,” he recalls. “We would see five, six seals in the water at once, socialising, chasing each other.” But with the sightings came the tourists. “What was exciting at first quickly turned into a nightmare,” he says. The hordes came, looking for “seal experiences”, he says. Instead of studying the animals, Gonzalvo found himself recording humans chasing seals. On two occasions, people entered breeding caves, causing the separation of mothers from pups. In both cases, the pups disappeared. One day in August 2024, he says he recorded more than 50 boats around the islet’s tiny shoreline. “Nowadays,” he says, “we are lucky if we see only one or two individual seals.” As we are talking Gonzalvo spots a seal and takes out his camera. He recognises her immediately. “Mm17003,” he says, citing the number of one of more than 40 seals . As the seal rolls through the water, boats pull up and anchor in the new no-entry zones while tourists swim near the protected caves. Unlike the Alonissos MPA, there are no wardens patrolling Formicula and, although it is not his job, Gonzalvo politely points out to the boat’s skippers that they are in a forbidden area. “It’s early days,” he says. “But the inactivity [the absence of patrols] worries me. We need serious investment on law enforcement.” In Greece, NGOs have repeatedly raised the issue of “ published last year by nine environmental organisations highlighted “only 12 (out of 174) marine Natura 2000 sites [EU protected areas] have a protective regime”, but even those were fragmented or temporary. The hope is that the new MPAs bring patrols. “The Natural Environment and Climate Change Agency needs more boats, more people, more authority,” Dendrinos says, adding that the wardens currently report to port police, “a process that is time consuming and ineffective”. At Formicula, Gonzalvo worries that time is running out. “If we are not capable of protecting this important habitat, a tiny drop in the middle of the Ionian Sea, for one of the most charismatic and endangered marine mammals on the planet, there is very little hope for anything else we want to protect in our oceans.”",Susan Smillie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/25/wild-animals-gift-give-present-christmas,Wild animals are great gift givers – and there’s one present in particular I’d love to receive for Christmas,2025-12-25T08:00:36.000Z,"Penguins hand over pebbles; scorpionflies give spitballs. But I’m hankering after a sea sponge presented by a dolphin his Christmas morning, are you worried you didn’t choose quite the right gift for that someone special? I always try my hardest, but everywhere I turn I’m bombarded with unhelpful suggestions. No, I don’t want a candle that , because, well, we’ll be cooking turkey. Nor do I want a that mimics natural light, because I can leave the curtains open. And I want a salmon DNA pink collagen jelly mask (Good Housekeeping’s ), because said DNA comes from milt. AKA semen. If I wanted fish sperm on my face, I would tickle some pollocks. So if, like me, you’re always looking for inspiration, my advice is: learn from the animal kingdom. Humans didn’t invent gifting. The practice has been around for at least , long before our species evolved. With a little help from natural selection, this has given wild animals ample time to perfect the art of giving. Hell, some spiders Excluding exercise-related items and other things I don’t like, there are five categories of Christmas gift: food, things for the home, bling, skincare and clothing. The animal kingdom has them all covered. Brazilian cuckoos give their partners high-protein snacks such as , but if you like your meat shished, then the great grey shrike, also known as the butcher bird, has your back. , such as insects and mice, on sharp thorns and twigs to create artisan kebabs. Some insects gift their beaus spitballs, but these aren’t just any spitballs. These are scorpionfly spitballs, crafted with the freshest saliva from the engorged labial glands of only the fittest males. The delicacy is nutrient-dense, which is one of the reasons females prefer males with big balls. Another reason is that the fittest males make the biggest spitballs, and when I say “fit” I don’t mean “looks great in a leather jacket” (although they probably do). I mean “fit” in the genetic sense. The gifts are given as a prelude to sex, so by choosing the male with the biggest package, the female is also selecting genetic quality. She then consumes the delicacy during sex but terminates intercourse as soon it’s all gone. Bigger spitballs mean longer copulation times, during which the male can transfer more sperm and the female can’t mate with anyone else. This explains why he bothers with such an elaborate offering. Adélie penguins don’t give food, but they do give things for the home. In Antarctica, where they live, there is no B&Q, so the birds must source their gifts from the local landscape. Each breeding season, males collect pebbles and start making a nest with them. The vital building blocks are scarce, prompting some chancers to from their neighbours, but when a male gives a pebble to a female, it is a sign he is ready to commit. Think of it as the penguin equivalent of a diamond ring. The rock doesn’t go on her finger, however. If she also wants to get serious, she accepts the pebble and adds it to the nest. Then, after a few finishing touches, they are ready to start their family. Speaking of bling, crows excel at this gift category. There are many stories of people who have befriended wild corvids and then been given bottle tops, screws, buttons and other shiny . In Florida, Alberta and Chuck Holloway even from a crow they fed regularly. This is particularly endearing because while most animals give presents in the hope of scoring (sound familiar?), crows apparently just enjoy giving. In Western Australia, meanwhile, dolphins have been spotted plucking clumps of sea sponge from the ocean floor and using them in interesting ways. Sometimes when they’re rummaging around for fish, they on their beak to help protect their skin. And sometimes, when males want to woo females, they In so doing, dolphins brilliantly combine the last two categories of Christmas gift. Sea sponges are clothing skincare. And if that’s not enough, when males give their sponge hats away, they often strike a U-shaped “banana pose” and play a little tune through their blowhole. This is not the half-arsed giving of domestic animals – my friend’s cat, Lilly, recently presented her with a dead mouse which she then stashed in an obscure corner of the house – or some people I could mention. Dolphin presents are thoughtful, multipurpose, sustainably sourced and delivered with panache. We can all learn from them. Mariah Carey may have said that all she wants for Christmas “is you”, but if I have one Christmas wish, it is to receive a sponge-hat-skin-protector thingy from a cetacean who serenades me with style.

Apologies to all the other spiders that exist; I have to be realistic about my possible growth as a human. It also has to be the huntsman because it is large, in charge, and the one I encounter most often. Including three times in the last week. Inside my home. You can’t see me but I’m shaking my head and grimacing as I type. I doubt I’ll ever reach “fan” status, but I’ve been working on at least becoming Normal about them. I have been terrified of spiders since I was a child (unlike other children who adore them). Growing up, I had ample brothers around to make sure I never had to engage with any personally, but I still freaked out if one was visibly in the same room as me. I have a strong memory of one morning when I was eight, my family still asleep, and trying to deal with a spider that had crawled on to the lounge-room wall. I “dealt” with it by standing incredibly far away, almost into the next room (in case it ran after me), and spraying half a bottle of insect spray toward it. It didn’t reach the spider, but it did reach and annoy everyone in my house. As I got older, whoever I was dating or living with was, by default, the least afraid of spiders between us, and therefore in charge of dealing with it, while I made low keening sounds and ran away. If I was on my own, my tactic was simply to leave the room, turn off the light and try to forget about its existence before I had to enter again. Recently, I stayed at a friend’s house where there was a very large huntsman who lived in the window frame, mostly just hanging out. In order to be less scared of it, I imagined the spider as a her, a girlie, one of us, just chilling in the sun and listening to us yap. It sounds extremely dumb, but it worked (a little bit). Or, actively deciding to become less scared worked. Whatever the case, I’ve tried to keep it up. I think about all the logical reasons not to be scared. I know huntsman spiders won’t harm me. I know they eat things like flies and mosquitoes (my mortal enemies). I know they are one of nature’s beautiful, harmless-to-humans creatures. Unfortunately, however, they do continue to walk like They move in the most terrifying and borderline immoral way imaginable. The sight of their many legs carrying them at that terrible speed causes my caveman brain to kick into overdrive. They claim to only have eight legs, but I believe that triples when they move. But it isn’t their fault that they have scary legs, and they have just as much right to be where I am – if not more. I’ve found that taking the steps of trying not to immediately exit my own skin and run away when I see one, trying to remain still and breathing, and deliberately thinking about their positive qualities, has actually started to help. Just because they are hairy creatures that scuttle about extremely quickly in a way that haunts my sleep, doesn’t mean they deserve my hatred, or my girly screams. I can admit when I’ve been wrong and driven by unfounded fear. I’m not sure I’ll ever make it to the “catching one in a Tupperware container and taking it outside” stage, but you never know. There’s a few years left in this old dog yet.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/13/nature-volcanic-island-surtsey-iceland-ecosystems-aoe,A new island erupted from the sea – can it show us how nature works without human interference?,2025-10-13T04:00:12.000Z,"The volcanic island of Surtsey emerged in the 1960s, and scientists say studying its development offers hope for damaged ecosystems worldwide he crew of the Ísleifur II had just finished casting their nets off the coast of southern when they realised something was wrong. In the early morning gloom in November 1963, a dark mass filled the sky over the Atlantic Ocean. They rushed to the radio, thinking that another fishing vessel was burning at sea, but no boats in the area were in distress. Then, their trawler began to drift unexpectedly, unnerving the crew further. The cook scrambled to wake the captain, thinking they were being pulled into a whirlpool. Finally, through binoculars, they spotted columns of ash bursting from the water and realised what was going on: a volcano was erupting in the ocean below. By the time the sun had risen, dark ash filled the sky and a ridge was forming just below the surface of the water. By the next morning, it was 10 metres high. A day later, it was 40 metres. An island was being born. Two months later, the rock was more than a kilometre long and 174 metres high at its peak. It was named Surtsey after the fire giant Surtr from Norse mythology. Islanders and fishers from the nearby Vestmannaeyjar archipelago watched as lightning struck the volcanic eruption, which waxed and waned in its intensity, lighting up the winter half light. It would be two years before it stopped erupting completely. “It is very rare to have an eruption where an island forms and is long lasting. It happens once every 3,000 to 5,000 years in this area,” says Olga Kolbrún Vilmundardóttir, a geographer with the Natural Science Institute of Iceland. Those that do form are often quickly washed away by the ocean, she says. The emergence of Surtsey presented researchers with a precious scientific opportunity. They could observe how life colonises and spreads on an island away from the human interference that has overtaken much of the Earth. Other islands have emerged since the 1960s, but scientists say they have not been as ecologically stable. The last time something similar took place before Surtsey’s emergence was the birth of Anak Krakatau, Indonesia, in 1927, but it was quickly contaminated by humans. Icelandic researchers were adamant that this time would be different. In 1965, Surtsey was placed under formal protection by the government. Only researchers and the odd journalist – under strict supervision – would be allowed to visit. No sheep would ever be allowed to graze there. The same year, the first plant was spotted: a clump of sea rocket brought over the waves from the Icelandic mainland. “The first scientists that stepped on Surtsey in 1964 could see that seeds and plant residues had been washed ashore. Birds were even coming to the island to see what was going on. The eruption was still going on when they spotted the first plant – it was very quick,” says Vilmundardóttir. Scientists had expected algae and mosses to be the first colonisers, building up a base of soil that would eventually support vascular plants. But that step was skipped completely. More plants were washed ashore in the following years, and some clung to the island’s bare volcanic rock. But after a decade, the changes seemed to stall. Pawel Wasowicz, director of botany at the Natural Science Institute, says: “People thought, what now? Around 10 species had colonised Surtsey at that point. The plant cover was really scarce. But then the birds arrived.” In the early 1980s, black-backed gulls started to nest on sections of the island, sheltering in one of the stormiest parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Their arrival kicked off an explosion of life. Guano carried seeds that quickly spread grasses along the island, fed in turn by the nutrients from the birds. For the first time, whole areas of bare rock became green. Wasowicz says: “It’s surprising. From the times of Darwin, biologists thought that it was just plant species with fleshy fruits that could travel with birds. But the species on Surtsey do not have fleshy fruits. Almost all of the seeds on Surtsey were brought in the faeces of the gulls.” One lesson from this living laboratory is that recovery after disturbance does not follow a single, predictable path, he says. Instead, it is shaped by multiple, sometimes surprising forces. Today, grey seals are the latest arrivals to drive changes in the island’s biodiversity. The volcanic rock has become a crucial “haul-out” site where seals come ashore to rest and moult, as well as a breeding ground where they can raise their young safe from the orcas lurking nearby. Their faeces, urine and placentas from birth are bringing nitrogen to the island, helping life spread further. But the researchers warn that the colonisation of Surtsey will one day go into reverse. The grey seal haul-out site is one of the areas slowly being eroded by the ocean. By the end of the century, scientists project that little will be left from that section of the island. Its biodiversity will probably peak, then fall over time, eventually leaving a rock with sharp cliffs alone in the Atlantic. But the researchers say that lessons will remain. Surtsey demonstrates that, even in the harshest environments, resilience and renewal are possible, says Wasowicz. It offers hope and practical lessons for rehabilitating ecosystems damaged by war, pollution or exploitation: if space is given, nature will always find ways to return, often faster and more creatively than we expect. Vilmundardóttir says: “I feel that Iceland is really contributing something important to humankind by preserving this area. On the mainland, the impact of humans is everywhere. When I am on Surtsey, I am really in nature. All you can hear are the birds. You see orcas along the coastline and the seals popping out and watching.”",Patrick Greenfield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/21/it-can-be-quite-a-thankless-job-why-driving-examiners-are-calling-it-quits,‘It can be quite a thankless job’: why driving examiners are quitting,2025-12-21T07:00:53.000Z,"A staff exodus and a broken booking system are helping to cause huge jams in Britain’s driving test system t has long been a stressful rite of passage for many young people but, in recent years, passing the actual driving test is the easy part. Now, many people seeking a test need to wake up early to snag a date before the bots do and, even then, they are looking at a long and arduous wait. , an audit report released this week found plans to cut the wait for a driving test to seven weeks by the end of the year would not be achieved until November 2027. One of the main barriers is an exodus of driving examiners. Only a net 83 more driving test examiners have been hired despite 19 recruitment campaigns since 2021, with the average wait for a practical test now at 22 weeks across Great Britain, according to the National Audit Office. So, why is it so hard to recruit Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) driving examiners, and are instructors – who used to flock to test centres for a more stable career – tempted by the current offer? In his previous job, kitted out with a bright hi-vis and Battenberg-marked car, Woodman was often mistaken for a police officer. “I was working as a traffic officer for Highways England. I was dealing with everything from hard-shoulder breakdowns to fatal incidents,” he said. After a friend suggested he become an DVSA examiner, Woodman took on the advice and joined a local test centre. He said he wanted to bring a “positive attitude” to his new role. “I really enjoyed the job. I remember it took me two goes to pass my driving test. I remember my first one having this really miserable driving examiner and I thought: ‘This is pure torture’. Then my second driving examiner was fantastic. He came out with a smile on his face and I said: ‘That’s the way I want to be,’” said Woodman. But the job did come with challenges. “You quite often get those times where you’ve stopped a crash from happening because you’ve taken control of a vehicle and then you’ve got to do another test within the next five minutes. That’s what people don’t realise about the job,” he said. On the other hand, Woodman said it was “nice to make an impact on people’s lives every day” by telling them they had passed. “Some people break down in tears and other try to give you a hug.” Despite enjoying the job, Woodman left the DVSA in June 2023. “I moved on because of the money. I was growing a family and I was jealous of a few mates of mine who were hybrid working,” he said. As government workers, DVSA driving examiners are paid on a civil service pay scale. They are designated executive officers, maxing out at just over £30,000. “Prices for lessons went up quite a bit after Covid and instructors were earning a lot more than they were previously,” said Woodman . He thinks that has “slimmed down” the DVSA’s pool of people. When Sykes first switched from being a freelance driving instructor to a DVSA examiner in 2016, he was happy. “At the time, I was taking home a similar amount of money without having to put in nearly as many hours. I was getting holiday pay, sick pay and a reasonable pension. I got my weekends back and I finished at the same time every night. I loved the job,” he said. But, after Covid, things changed. He was vocal to senior DVSA figures about the issues he was experiencing with the job, including, he said, the recently departed chief executive, Loveday Rider. He said he had met her on four occasions and brought up examiner’s poor wages and the “dodgy” booking system which allows bots and less reputable instructors to buy up tests and sell them at a hugely inflated price. “It’s not fair on the learner,” he said. Sykes switched back to being a driving instructor but he still has fond memories of being an examiner. “I had one lady, her name was Jean. She was 82 years old. She had been here five times and she was desperate to pass. “She’d started to learn to drive when she was about 20 and then she met her husband. After this, she had no reason to need to drive any more because her husband drove,” said Sykes. After her husband died, she still wanted to get around so she started learning to drive again. “She passed her test when she was 82. It was amazing and lovely giving somebody that age a pass certificate,” said Sykes. On the other hand, there are some close calls, including one instance that left him “drip white”. He recalls one young woman who wanted to do her test in her own car, which she had hardly driven, because “that’s the car that she’s going to be driving when she passes”, he said. “The instructor was sat in the back. As we emerged out at the end of a road, the candidate on test had missed the fact that there was a car transporter with about 12 cars on it hurtling up the road at 30 miles an hour towards us,” said Sykes. “She tries to pull out but she fumbles at the controls. She reached for a manual handbrake in the car but there wasn’t one, only an electric one she was unfamiliar with. I said: ‘Drive, drive, drive.’ I went drip white, so did the instructor. We just pulled up to the side of the road and I went: ‘I think we’ve seen enough.’” Ramwell, who runs the YouTube channel , has been an instructor since 2019. Before this, he was a teacher. Does being a DVSA driving examiner tempt him? “If I’m completely honest, no,” he said. While Ramwell takes his “hat off to examiners” who have his “complete and full respect”, he thinks it can be quite a thankless job. He said: “When you pass someone, they generally thank the instructor. And if you end up failing someone, examiners end up being blamed for it.” He was a relative late bloomer to driving, getting his licence at 22. He said the most rewarding part of being an instructor was when students get a “lightbulb moment”, whether struggling with a clutch or taking on a daunting roundabout. “You can see it in their eyes, the cogs working, and next thing you know, they’re absolutely perfect at roundabouts,” he said. Ramwell has had many success stories but, like most instructors, some near-misses as well. “I had this really lovely girl but she suffered a lot from anxiety. We were driving down the road and unfortunately, there was another driver behind us who might have been late for work or something because she was tailgating us a bit closer than you would like. “I told the girl: ‘Don’t look behind you. Just focus ahead, the roundabout’s coming up. In a minute you’re gonna have to press the brake.’ “The second I said the word ’brake’, in the middle of the road at 30 miles an hour, she just full-on emergency stopped and I had enough time to shout ‘Noo’ before the person behind hit straight into the back of us. That was a very sad day.”",Sammy Gecsoyler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/15/iphone-air-review-apple-pursuit-absolute-thinness,iPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinness,2025-10-15T06:00:16.000Z,"Ultra-slim and light smartphone feels special, but cuts to camera and battery may be too hard to ignore for most The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Air is a technical and design marvel that asks: how much are you willing to give up for a lightweight and ultra-slender profile? The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Beyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body. Cut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass. Doing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the Photos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17. The glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic. The Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. It with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely on . In the US Apple has only supported eSims since the , but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air. Most of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere. 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) 5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSS IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) The Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to the , but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs. Despite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges. On heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode. with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be . Specialists iFixit awarded the iPhone Air a It contains more than 35% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. The company breaks down the in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. The camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front. The main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the , but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects. The lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower cost The 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window. , the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs and the Fairphone 6 sells for The iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera. The super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thin , the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down. The battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case. The biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories. But if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere. super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID. no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI.",Samuel Gibbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/undermines-free-speech-labour-mp-hits-back-at-us-government-over-visa-related-sanctions,‘Undermines free speech’: Labour MP hits back at US government over visa ban on UK campaigners,2025-12-24T16:26:13.000Z,"Chi Onwurah speaks out after Marco Rubio accused five Europeans, including two Britons, of ‘seeking to suppress American viewpoints they oppose’ A senior Labour MP has accused the Trump administration of undermining free speech after Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, announced sanctions against two British anti-disinformation campaigners. Chi Onwurah, the chair of parliament’s technology select committee, criticised the US government hours after “visa-related” sanctions against five Europeans, including Imran Ahmed and Clare Melford. Ahmed leads the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), while Melford is chief executive of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), both of which have clashed directly with , the owner of X and a former adviser to the US president. Onwurah said on Wednesday: “Banning people because you disagree with what they say undermines the free speech the administration claims to seek. “We desperately need a wide ranging debate on whether and how social media should be regulated in the interests of the people. Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content, and he was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability. “Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.” Her comments came after Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”. Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department, : “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.” The CCDH has previously incurred the wrath of Musk over its reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took over the platform. Musk to sue the organisation last year, before calling it a “criminal organisation”. The X owner has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation. And he has railed against the EU’s Digital Services Act, which Breton helped spearhead, and under which X with a €120m (£105m) fine for what the EU called the deceptive design of its blue tick system for verifying users. Melford is UK-based, while Ahmed, whose organisation once employed Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a director, lives in Washington DC with his family. A spokesperson for GDI called the sanctions “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. They added: “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.” Ahmed has been approached for comment. A British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.” That response contrasted, however, with the more combative stance taken by the French government and the European Commission. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the measures “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. The commission said in a statement it “strongly condemns” the actions of the Trump administration. Jonathan Hall, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Times Radio: “[This] will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject [internet regulation] at the moment.” Campaigners in the UK warned the British government was likely to be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation. Ava Lee, the executive director of People Vs Big Tech, said: “The Trump administration is escalating its attacks on Europeans trying to uphold the rule of law when it comes to big tech. With the Online Safety Act (OSA), the UK is likely to be next in the firing line.” The Trump administration has previously flagged its concerns about the OSA. This year a group of officials from the state department met , the regulator charged with overseeing the act, and are understood to have raised concerns that the act will risk infringing free speech. Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK’s House of Lords and a prominent online safety campaigner, said Rubio’s comments on the visa bans were an “outrage”. “The US tech sector, backed by the US administration, is attempting to undermine European laws and values,” she said.",Kiran Stacey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He in 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.” It was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing. When publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said Once again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.” This emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made. Its campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre. In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained : “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.” After splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures” Titanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone. Respawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy. In 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series. Zampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience. “Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",Keza MacDonald,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Watch SE 3’s biggest upgrade is an always-on display, which brings it up to par with the Series line, allowing you to see the time and notifications at a glance without having to twist your wrist to turn the screen on. The SE 3 has the older Apple Watch design from 2020’s with smaller screens, larger bezels and a choice of 40mm or 44mm case sizes compared with the current Series watches. The screen is also not quite as bright as the more expensive watches, but that is noticeable only in bright direct sunlight. It is still sharp and good looking. The SE 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, and is just as responsive. It also has the same excellent touch-free gestures, including double tap and wrist flick, which allow you to dismiss notifications, timers and alarms easily. The watch also supports all the rest of the general Apple Watch features in , including Apple Pay contactless payments, rich notifications, music control, third-party apps and a range of watch faces. The battery life of the SE 3 is a little shorter than the Series 11, lasting about a day and a half of general use, including sleep tracking overnight. Most will have to charge it every other day, particularly if they track any workouts. The SE 3 will last up to seven hours of running tracking with GPS and heart rate, which should be long enough for a marathon.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/18/2025-ai-boom-huge-co2-emissions-use-water-research-finds,"AI boom has caused same CO2 emissions in 2025 as New York City, report claims",2025-12-18T11:15:59.000Z,"Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost The AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed. The global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research on Wednesday, which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand. The figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of , a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they were the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025. The figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact. “The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?” De Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use. The figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030. “This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started. “Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system.” The IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%). The largest datacentre being planned in the , at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes. In India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it. Google reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.",Robert Booth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. The latest update to Garmin’s class-leading Fenix adventure watch adds something that could save your life: phone-free communications and emergency messaging on 4G or via satellite. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. The Fenix 8 Pro takes the and adds in the new cellular tech, plus the option of a cutting-edge microLED screen in a special edition of the watch. It is Garmin’s top model and designed to be the only tool you need to more-or-less go anywhere and track anything. That makes it an extremely pricey proposition starting at £1,030 (€1,200, $1,200, A$2,300) for the 47mm OLED version and stretching to a colossal £1,730 (€2,000/$2,000/A$3,399) for the 51mm version with microLED display – almost twice the price of the regular Fenix 8. You do get a lot of watch for your money with best-in-class workout, activity and adventure tracking. The full offline maps of the globe can automatically guide you back on to the trail if you get lost without a phone, and look great on the large, sharp and super-bright touchscreen. The Fenix 8 Pro only comes in 47mm or 51mm case sizes, not the smaller 43mm version Garmin offers in other models, so it is a big watch for big wrists. But the 47mm OLED version as tested does have an extra day of smartwatch-use battery life even with the screen on all the time, lasting a solid eight to nine days between charges. instead of relying on a watch plan linked to your phone provider, like other smartwatches. But unlike Apple or Google’s satellite-capable devices, emergency SOS messaging is not included for free. , which provides unlimited LTE text and voice messaging, calls and location sharing – so your friends or loved ones can keep an eye on you while out running, cycling or similar – plus emergency satellite SOS messaging. Check-ins and texts over satellite are then charged on top, with more expensive plans including various allowances of satellite use, climbing to a £50 a month unlimited plan. The watch comes with a 30-day free trial so you can test out the service. Once you have got it set up, you simply head out the door without your phone and the watch will connect to LTE. You can not use it for streaming music or similar, but you can make and take calls, send texts and generally keep in touch with your family and friends. When you text someone, Garmin sends them an SMS from a random phone number, which they can reply to back to your watch. If they install the , you can then message back and forth via text or voice messages, and make voice calls. Your recipient does not need a Garmin account to use the Messenger app, just a phone number is sufficient to register for texts. Messaging on the watch works fine but typing out texts on the tiny on-screen keyboard is slow. It has a set of customisable canned responses you can send to speed things up. Voice messages and calls work OK, though as with most smartwatches, you’re not going to want to use it for extended conversations as the quality is not fantastic. LiveTrack is the most useful feature. You can configure it to automatically send a link to chosen contacts every time you start an activity, so they can follow your real time location on a map. It’s great for following race progress, but it mostly serves as a tool for someone you trust to know your whereabouts in case something happens. It has generally worked well, though the real location has sometimes lagged when moving in and out of good LTE signal. All of these features are available on other Garmin watches if you carry your phone with you, but in the places where LTE does not reach, the satellite kicks in on the Fenix 8 Pro to send texts, location check-ins and emergency SOS. A guide shows you how to find the line of sight to the satellite, which then sends and receives messages within about 10 to 30 seconds. It was surprisingly easy to use and could be a crucial lifeline, though it is important to note that to the US mainland, most of Canada, and most of Europe except for parts of Scandinavia above 65 degrees north. The watch is generally repairable with options . The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin offers The Fenix 8 Pro costs from ). The optional Garmin inReach subscription plans cost begins from The Fenix 8 Pro takes a fantastic adventure watch in the regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE for messaging, calls and LiveTrack – plus satellite messaging, check-in and emergency SOS for when you’re out of signal. The result is an even more impressive adventure tool for those that want to be phone-free. If you want to have someone keep an eye on you remotely while running out at night or in the middle of nowhere, the Garmin does so without needing anything else. It is quite freeing to be outside without a phone, but that capability comes at quite a cost, both in terms of the colossal price of the watch and the monthly subscription of the inReach plan to provide the service. At least it isn’t dependent on your phone provider so works with any brand of smartphone and network. The Fenix 8 Pro is a killer device for someone who hates being weighed down by their phone when running, cycling or hiking, but still wants to be trackable and contactable. For everyone else, it is a lot of money when the excellent Fenix 8 already exists.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/biography-russian-telegram-founder-pavel-durov,Biography aims to fill gaps in story of ultra-libertarian Telegram founder Pavel Durov,2025-12-23T08:41:06.000Z,"Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint Tech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to The Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app , launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond. But much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured. A new biography aims to change that. The Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users. as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics. The book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation. “Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”. Both VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview. “He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said. That strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists. If Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks. “He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.” The portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial. “What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said. Durov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint. Like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in , the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty. Durov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has dozens of children through sperm donation. One of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2013, held behind closed doors. Kononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country. Under pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram. But the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France. Durov, who also holds French citizenship, was and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions. His detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state. It also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric. Most recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk. “What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.” Kononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances. One of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services. But Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said. Kononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating. Kononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship. About a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding. “He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",Pjotr Sauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. They are a replacement for running glasses, open-ear headphones and a head-mounted action cam all in one, and are the latest product of Meta’s partnership with the sunglasses conglomerate , the owner of Ray-Ban, Oakley and many other top brands. Wayfarer camera-equipped AI smart glasses are designed for general leisure, the Vanguard are unashamedly sports glasses designed to go fast and capture your efforts as you do it. That makes them some of the most expensive screenless AI glasses you can get, starting at a not insignificant £499 (€549/$499/A$789), sitting above the £399 Oakley Meta HSTN and £379 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer. The Vanguard don’t look like your standard smart glasses. It is clear Meta brought the technology but Oakley brought the design, fit and finish. The huge wraparound visor, arms and three-point fit system mimic the excellent , which keeps their 66g frame glued to your head no matter how hard you shake them or how sweaty you get, and they fit under helmets. There are two frame colours and four contrast-enhancing lenses to choose from, but no option for prescription lenses. A small button on the left arm near the hinge allows you to turn the glasses on and off so you can use them just as sunglasses. A speaker is hidden in each arm that points towards your ear for listening to music, calls or Meta’s AI chatbot. They are some of the best-sounding open-ear speakers you can get and are more than loud enough to be heard over road or wind noise. They can’t match a set of earbuds for bass but for music while running or just out walking they are great. The five beamforming mics also do a very good job of cutting out background noise, even on busy roads, for calls or talking to AI. The right arm has a touch panel for controlling playback and volume manually. The music pauses when you take the glasses off, and the volume automatically adjusts to the level of background noise, which works really well while running around roads. 6h music playback (30h with case) The central camera shoots 12-megapixel photos of reasonable quality and really good stabilised video up to 3K resolution for up to five minutes at a time. It can also shoot hyperlapses, which are a series of action shots stitched together into one sped-up clip, or slo-mo videos at up to 120 frames a second at 720p. The camera can’t match a high-end phone but is very good for capturing the action as it happens, similar to the typical mid-range action cameras people strap to themselves. Press the camera button for photos or press and hold for videos, or you can ask Meta AI to take a photo or capture a video hands-free. All these features, including music, auto volume and basic voice controls for volume, playback and the camera, work when connected to any Bluetooth device, such as a running watch. But for more advanced AI features the glasses need to be connected to an Android or iPhone running the You can ask Meta AI questions like any other chatbot, including what you are looking at using the camera. It can identify plants, translate text and generally interrogate the world around you. It is extremely handy for converting distances and paces between metric and imperial mid-run but isn’t quite as capable as Google’s Gemini on a phone. You can also message, send photos and call friends hands-free from the glasses via your phone or with one of Meta’s apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram. running watches and bike computers. A free Meta AI app on your Garmin links to the Meta AI app on your phone so you can interrogate your stats in real time mid-activity simply by asking. The AI can tell you any of your individual metrics, such as pace, distance, heart rate, cadence and others, or the lot by asking for “my stats”, all pulled directly from your Garmin at that moment. It will also read out the pace or other metrics for each lap, mile or kilometre and to the right of your eye to show if you are on target during a pace or heart rate zone workout, turning red when you are outside your zone. The Garmin integration also enables the camera to your walking, hiking, running or riding workouts. It shoots five-second videos for every kilometre or mile, or when you hit certain milestones such as a burst of pace for a sprint finish or when your heart rate ramps up on a steep incline. Once you have finished, the Meta AI app then stitches the videos together with any you took manually into a highlights reel when you get back. You can then overlay stats from the workout, such as distance, pace, elevation, time, heart rate and power, and send it to Meta’s apps or Strava to automatically add to your existing workout post. The whole thing works fantastically, and while you’re not going to want to create videos for every run, automatically capturing highlights from a race without you having to do anything is a great bonus. Capturing all this video dents the battery life. On an hour-long run listening to music and talking to Meta AI lots of times, with 14 five-second videos auto-captured and 13 minutes of 1080p/30fps video and 14 photos taken manually, the glasses ended the run with 25% battery left. They should last for a full marathon with auto-capture turned on, but you may have to be careful with extended shooting to make the full 42km distance. For those who don’t use a Garmin, the Meta AI app can integrate with Apple Health, Google Health Connect or Strava to pull data from other watches or bike computers after the fact, including the Apple Watch and Coros devices. But the metrics overlaid on videos are more limited, and you get none of the auto-capture or mid-run stats. The battery in the glasses will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full-charge cycles. Replacement lenses ( ) will be available but the glasses are not repairable and the batteries not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. The glasses do not contain recycled material and Meta does not operate trade-in schemes or publish environmental impact reports for the glasses. For comparison, the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (gen 2) cost from , the Oakley Meta HSTN cost from The Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses for sport I’ve ever tested. They are extremely expensive but it’s very clear they are designed for runners and sports by people who actually run. By concentrating on things runners, cyclists and adventure sports people want, such as a fit that won’t quit, lenses that actually block the wind from your eyes, proper water resistance, loud open-ear audio, long battery life and good controls, they would be great without more of the fancy features. The nose-mounted camera is very good and could easily replace an action cam for many. The mics continue to work at pace and Meta’s built-in AI is useful for answering those mid-run questions that always pop into your head. But the killer feature it is the integration with Garmin, for stats mid-run and for automatic highlights reels of your routes from the camera. It’s just so easy but requires carrying your phone on a run, which is a bit of a drag. Strava and other fitness app links offer something for non-Garmin users. If you ditch the phone and use them directly with a running watch for music, the auto-volume and basic voice commands for volume, playback and the camera still work. The very high price is hard to swallow but the biggest issue is the irreplaceable battery: you can swap the lenses and nose pads but like most earbuds and other smart glasses they are unrepairable, big and great lenses, secure fit, well balanced, loud open-ear speakers, noise-mounted camera, IP67 water resistance, long battery life, good case, excellent Garmin integration, good Strava and other fitness app links, swappable lenses and nose pads. very expensive, unrepairable, needs phone for most advanced features, overkill for just audio on runs.",Samuel Gibbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/macron-eu-condemn-us-visa-bans-row-censorship-escalates,European leaders condemn US visa bans as row over ‘censorship’ escalates,2025-12-24T12:36:36.000Z,"Washington accused of ‘coercion and intimidation’ after five leading figures behind digital safety law campaign targeted have accused Washington of “coercion and intimidation”, after the US imposed a visa ban on five prominent European figures who have been at heart of the campaign to introduce laws regulating American tech companies. The visa bans were imposed on Tuesday on Thierry Breton, the former EU commissioner and one of the architects of the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, including two in Germany and two in the UK. The other individuals targeted were Imran Ahmed, the British chief executive of the US-based Center for Countering Digital Hate; Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of the German non-profit HateAid; and Clare Melford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index. Justifying the visa bans, the US secretary of state, , wrote on X: “For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organised efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.” Germany, Spain, the UK and a chorus of EU officials joined the French president in condemning the move, with Brussels signalling it could “respond swiftly and decisively” against the “unjustified measures”. The DSA is seen by Washington as a form of censorship while European leaders say the regulations are necessary to control hate speech, but the row threatens to become part of a far wider existing cultural and political conflict between Donald Trump’s administration and . Artificial intelligence and digital technologies were always likely to become a major theatre of confrontation between the US and Europe, as these technologies become ever more central to wielding power. Macron condemned the visa ban in furious terms. “These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he wrote, also on X. “The European Union’s digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council. They apply within Europe to ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country, and to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. The rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe”. He later added he had spoken to Breton, who is French, and had thanked him for his work. “We will not give up, and we will protect Europe’s independence and the freedom of Europeans,” Macron said. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “The peoples of Europe are free and sovereign and cannot let the rules governing their digital space be imposed by others upon them.” Breton, a former French finance minister and the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019 to 2024, said: “Is McCarthy’s witch-hunt back? “As a reminder: 90% of the European parliament – our democratically elected body – and all 27 member states unanimously voted the DSA. To our American friends: censorship isn’t where you think it is.” The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy. We are proud of it. We will protect it.” A commission spokesperson added: “If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures.” In the UK, the government said it was “fully committed” to upholding free speech. The EU law, passed in 2022, requires large digital platforms to show they are taking steps to address online risks, including the spread of illegal content, hate speech and the use of disinformation to manipulate election results. After two years of investigation, Elon Musk’s X platform was this month fined €120m (£104m) over a series of transgressions mainly relating to transparency, including deceiving users about verification checks, and researcher’s access. Washington said the EU was pursuing “undue” restrictions on freedom of expression and the DSA’s s extraterritorial restrictions were designed to weaken US tech firms and US citizens. Breton was replaced in the internal market role at the EU by another French politician, Stéphane Séjourné, who is the Commission’s executive vice-president. Séjourné expressed his support for his predecessor saying: “No sanction will silence the sovereignty of the European peoples. Total solidarity with him and all the people of Europe affected by this”. Outlining the bans on Tuesday, US under secretary for public diplomacy, Sarah Rogers, classified Breton as a “mastermind” of the DSA. Germany’s justice ministry said the two German campaigners had the government’s “support and solidarity” and the visa bans were unacceptable, adding that HateAid supported people affected by unlawful digital hate speech. The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, echoed the remarks on X: “The DSA was democratically adopted by the EU for the EU – it does not have extraterritorial effect. Spain’s foreign ministry also condemned the US measures, saying in a statement: “A safe digital space, free from illegal content and disinformation, is a fundamental value for democracy in Europe and a responsibility for everyone. “Anyone who describes this as censorship is misrepresenting our constitutional system. The rules by which we want to live in the digital space in Germany and in Europe are not decided in Washington.” Dennis Radtke, an MEP and member of the German ruling CDU, said: “The Trump fans in Europe defend this as a fight for freedom of speech. Where exactly has an opinion been suppressed? Where is the fight for freedom of speech with regard to China and Russia? It’s only about business here and the fight against the rule of law.” Raphaël Glucksmann, a French socialist MEP, said in a message to Rubio: “For far too long, Europe has been weak in implementing its own laws and defending its own interests. You have chosen to cosy up tyrants and confront democracies. The time has come for us to stand up. Kneel as much as you want in front of Putin, we are the free world now. “We are not a colony of the United States. We are Europeans, we must defend our laws, our principles, our interests. This scandalous sanction against Thierry Breton pays tribute to his fight for our sovereignty. We will continue it together. To the end.” The row is the latest to showcase tensions between the US and Europe. In August, Washington imposed sanctions on the French judge Nicolas Yann Guillou, who sits on the international criminal court, for the tribunal’s targeting of Israeli leaders and a past decision to investigate US officials. Michel Duclos, a former senior French diplomat and resident senior fellow in geopolitics and diplomacy at the Institut Montaigne thinktank lamented the move, referencing Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev’s recent trip to Miami for talks on the Ukraine war. He said: “Dmitriev celebrated in Miami, Breton denied US visa: Europe is becoming the new Russia for Washington. It brings to mind the 1920s – America favouring the former enemy [Germany) against its former allies – but worse.” The chair of the German Journalists’ Association, Mika Beuster, expressed, solidarity with the Berlin-based HateAid. “This is censorship in its purest form, the likes of which we have previously only known from autocratic regimes,” said Beuster.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. he 17 Pro is Apple’s biggest redesign of the in years, chucking out the old titanium sides and all-glass backs for a new aluminium unibody design, a huge full-width camera lump on the back and some bolder colours. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage. From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year. The aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset. A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar . The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the , so a case is still prudent. as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes. 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) 48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facing 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) The 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer. It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold. The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use. with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be .

The company breaks down the in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. There are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front. The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting. New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too. All three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets. Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone. The iPhone 17 Pro costs from , iPhone 17 Pro Max costs The 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models. The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous. But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera. That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business. So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get.

Pornhub is a heavily used site and says it has more than 100m daily visits globally. The hack was reportedly carried out by a western-based group called ShinyHunters, according to the , which first reported the incident. The site reported that the data included premium members’ email addresses, search and viewing activity and location. The data consists of 201m records related to premium members. The website added that the Canadian-owned Pornhub had received an extortion demand from ShinyHunters about the hack. The Reuters news agency on Wednesday also claimed to have spoken to a ShinyHunters member in an online chat who was demanding a payment in bitcoin to prevent the publication of data and delete it. Pornhub said in a statement on its website that premium users had been affected by an attack on Mixpanel, a company that had provided data analytics to the publisher. Pornhub said a “select” number of users had been affected and that it had stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021, indicating the data is not recent. “It is important to note this was not a breach of Pornhub Premium’s systems. Passwords, payment details and financial information remain secure and were not exposed,” said the pornography service. Pornhub added that an “unauthorized party” had been able to extract a “limited set of analytics events for some users”. Other types of data taken include video URL, video name, keywords associated with the video, and the time the event occurred, according to BleepingComputer. In a statement Mixpanel said it was “aware” of the alleged data theft but said it had found no indication that it was related to a cyber-attack on the business last month. Sophos, a cybersecurity firm, told the Guardian it had seen no evidence of Pornhub data being released on so-called leak sites – part of a hacking group’s armoury for extracting payments – or in online chat platforms linked to the ShinyHunters group. Sophos said the ShinyHunters group was generally comprised of native English speakers in their late teens to early 20s and was part of a broader community of cyber criminals dubbed The Com, short for The Community. The Com is the same community from which the English-language speaking Scattered Spider group emerged, and which has been with hacks against M&S, the Co-op and Harrods.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/21/ai-voice-cloning-nazis-islamic-state-extremism,Extremists are using AI voice cloning to supercharge propaganda. Experts say it’s helping them grow,2025-12-21T13:00:01.000Z,"Researchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideology , voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow. “The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world. “Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.” On the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps. by the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English. , the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi and that became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November. “For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools. “Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.” The influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice. “But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said. At its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year. “The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”. Webber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”. Jihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operative , would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI have of al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message. On Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI. “Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.” So far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching. Counterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies like and share files for 3D printed firearms.",Ben Makuch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major retailers such as Marks & Spencer, Samsung, QVC, Clarks, and Sainsbury’s are now selling their wares on the site’s e-commerce service, Shop, alongside more than 200,000 UK small and medium businesses. Launched in Britain in 2021, TikTok Shop recorded its biggest sales day in the UK on Black Friday, with 27 items sold every second. Across the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, sales were up by 50% on last year. The service works by letting brands sell directly inside TikTok through videos and livestreams with embedded links to items for sale, as well as through a separate shop tab on their profiles. A brand can post its own content and link to products itself, or allow influencers to promote them using affiliate links. Checkout happens without having to leave the app, and money is split after a sale between TikTok, the seller and any creator who helped drive it. Sainsbury’s, one of the first major supermarkets to launch on the platform, has found success with its Tu Christmas pyjamas. A sponsored collaboration with the influencer Rachel Spicer generated 6.6m views, with the pyjamas selling out in under a week. M&S has also enjoyed strong results from TikTok Shop livestreams with links to featured items, with one recent feed attracting 260,000 viewers and generating sales of about one item every 30 seconds. Small businesses are using it to try to increase their reach, especially now that AI is . The Fat Butcher, an online meat delivery service based in Newcastle, is selling fresh turkeys on the platform for the first time this year. According to Danielle Dullaghan, the social strategy director at the global marketing agency Iris, “beauty brands in particular are seeing strong commercial returns”. She says part of TikTok Shop’s success is the fact “it plays directly into impulse buying behaviour”. The London-based jewellery brand L’ERA, run by Lara Mar and her daughters Talia Mar and Angele Sofia, will generate about £145,000 in revenue through TikTok this year. “It has almost doubled year on year, and many of our online customers originally discovered us via TikTok,” Mar says. The brand relies heavily on live shopping, typically running three three-hour live streams a week, increasing to six during the Black Friday and Christmas periods. TikTok shoppers have shown a willingness to spend, with L’ERA’s largest single order via the platform exceeding £1,400. The business and social media consultant Jules Brim says: “TikTok Shop has exploded and for some small brands it’s been a gamechanger in terms of reach and sales. But what we don’t talk about enough is the cost. It can create a race to the bottom on pricing, put pressure on small businesses to produce constant content, and shift the focus from brand building to chasing trends.”",Sarah Marsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it has done so, while also doubling the starting storage, without increasing the price. The iPhone 17 still starts at the same £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) as its predecessor, sitting below the £999 , while offering a lot of iPhone for the money. From the outside it doesn’t look as if anything has changed since , but the 17 is ever so slightly taller to squeeze in the bigger screen with slimmer borders without making the phone materially larger. The 6.3in screen now matches the super-bright display on the 17 Pro covered with significantly toughened glass to better resist scratches. The 120Hz “Pro Motion” tech is the best bit, doubling the refresh rate of the screen to make scrolling and animations much smoother and more responsive. It has been a feature common to rival smartphones for years, but Apple has until this point reserved it for Pro models of the iPhone, The 17 also has the previously Pro-only , which shows the time, widgets and notifications while the phone is idle. And it runs with Apple’s new glass-like interface design as the rest of the iPhone lineup. It looks a bit different and some elements have been simplified or condensed to get out of the way of the content you’re trying to see, but generally it works the same with some nice touches here and there. 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) 48MP main + 48MP UW; 18MP front-facing 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) The iPhone 17 has Apple’s new A19 chip, which is only a little less powerful than the A19 Pro in the other models this year, making it one of the fastest chips in a smartphone. Apple still has a lead over Android rivals in processors, even in cheaper models. As a result the 17 handles everything you could want to do with a phone with aplomb. Battery life is also good for a phone of this size, lasting a solid 44 hours of mixed usage across wifi and 5G between charges, actively using the screen for about six hours and with the always-on display feature turned on.

Occasionally it can be blown out by bright lights or suffer from a bit of blur or grain in low-light conditions, but it is a reliably good point-and-shoot camera. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which works great in good light and OK in dimmer indoor lighting. The ultrawide is an upgrade on predecessors, shooting with greater detail and range. It works particularly well for the macro mode for closeup photos. The camera can digitally zoom up 10x, but the resulting photos lack detail and sharpness. A real camera zoom is still The new front-facing camera shoots solid selfies, which are slightly better than previous iPhones. But its party piece is the ability to automatically pan and zoom to fit everyone in for group shots, no matter which orientation you hold the phone. Shooting landscape photos while holding your phone in portrait is surprisingly useful. The 17 has plenty of modes to play about with and shoots great video, including a dual-capture feature that records from the front and back cameras at the same time to put the photographer into the shot in a little window. , the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs The iPhone 17 may not look all that different from last year’s model, but it is a meaningful upgrade on all the standard model iPhones that have come before. That’s because it has key features pulled down from , including a significantly better, brighter and 120Hz-smooth screen. It’s a must-have feature that has been standard on rival phones for years. The always-on display is super handy too, while double the starting storage to 256GB and about two-day battery life is very welcome. For the first time in many years, using the iPhone 17 doesn’t feel like a significant downgrade from the Pro models. The dual camera on the back is good, but the lack of a telephoto option keeps it from being great. The iPhone 17 still feels compact for a modern phone, and while not Unless you need a camera zoom, the standard iPhone 17 is the one to get for Apple buyers.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. The Ultra 3 is Apple’s answer to adventure watches such as while being a full smartwatch for the iPhone with all the trimmings. As such, it is not cheap, costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399) – £50 less than From the outside it doesn’t look like a lot has changed for the Ultra 3 over its . Available in natural or black titanium, it is exactly the same size but squeezes in a slightly bigger screen with smaller bezels making it the largest on an Apple Watch. The display is much brighter when viewed at an angle, which makes seeing it at a glance a lot easier, and now shows ticking seconds when idle like the and 11. It is very bright, covered by super-hard sapphire glass and has one of the very best screens on a watch. The Ultra 3 has the same S10 chip as and the same excellent touch-free gestures. Double tap your thumb and index finger to press buttons or scroll, or flick your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss alarms, notifications or return to the watch face. Apple has managed to fit a 6% larger battery into the Ultra 3, which lasts a good three-plus days between charges with general usage and sleep tracking over night. Most people will need to put it on the charger every third night, which is a good day longer than any other Apple Watch, although some way behind the week-long battery of adventure watch The watch fully charges in about two hours, hitting 50% in 30 minutes via the included USB-C magnetic charging puck. The watch supports 5G, if you have a compatible phone plan, and has noticeably stronger cellular reception in weaker signal areas for 4G. Apple has also brought its free satellite SOS messaging to the Ultra 3, which allows you to contact the emergency services via text using satellites when out of cellular signal range. Satellites can also be used for Find My location tracking and messages to friends and loved ones, although the latter is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico, and both need a compatible cellular data plan. The Ultra 3 runs the same recent as the Series 11 and other Apple Watches, which introduced a revamped design and some new watch faces. In addition, the Ultra 3 has an attractive new Waypoint watch face, which has a live compass that shows points of interest around you. It joins a few other information-dense Ultra-exclusive faces, including the Wayfinder and Modular Ultra. HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, dual-band GPS, compass, altimeter Bluetooth 5.3, wifi n, NFC, UWB, satellite, optional 5G/eSIM The Ultra supports the same comprehensive health and fitness-tracking capabilities as the . That includes a wealth of heart health monitoring, such as ECG, abnormal rhythm notifications, blood oxygen tracking, and new hypertension alerts that analyse 30-days of readings for signs of high blood pressure. It has Apple’s new sleep score metric, which makes it easier to understand your tracked sleep, plus wrist temperature monitoring, cycle tracking with ovulation estimation and many other tools. The Ultra builds on the workout tracking of the standard Apple Watch in a couple of ways. The extra action button in the side can be used to quickly start a workout, but unlike Apple’s other watches you can wait until you have a GPS lock before starting the exercise by pressing it again. The best bit is a dual-band GPS system that boosts tracking accuracy in tricky environments, such as dense urban areas with tall buildings or in woods. It’s a feature found on and has been improved since the to become one of the most accurate on the market, matching or beating the very best in urban GPS stress tests. It also tracks a good number of metrics including the usual distance, pace and cadence, plus running power and dynamics, training load and heart rate zones. It can be loaded with structured workouts such as intervals, and it has a very good track detection mode for doing laps. The Ultra has similarly good cycling, swimming and triathlon profiles, plus diving to 40-metre depths and at least 22 other activities. Combined with the large and bright screen, and the decent 11 to 14-hour battery life when tracking running at its highest accuracy levels, the Ultra 3 makes for a surprisingly good sports watch. The Ultra also supports Apple’s new , which works with walks, runs, hikes, cycling and various other training workouts, giving you pep-talks before, during and after activities via Bluetooth headphones. But it requires you to carry an iPhone 15 Pro or later for it to work, which is a drag. Apple says the battery should last more than with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for The watch contains more than 40% recycled material, including cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact The Apple Watch Ultra 3 comes in a choice of two colours and multiple bands costing from The Ultra 3 is the biggest, baddest and best Apple Watch the company makes but it isn’t a massive leap over previous models. Other than satellite SOS messaging, which could genuinely save your life in an emergency, the rest of the watch is simply a refinement of the Ultra 2. But the added battery life is very welcome, so is a bigger and fancier screen in the same size watch. New software features are great and the wrist-flick gesture for dismissing things is the best thing added to any Apple Watch in recent memory. The Ultra is still a rarer sight than other models, so if you wanted a less ubiquitous Apple Watch this is it. While those looking for a dedicated top-priced sports watch might overlook it in favour of a Garmin or similar, the Ultra 3 has all the ingredients to be a first-rate training companion – as long as you can charge it more frequently – while still being the best smartwatch you can get with an iPhone. The Ultra 3 is the best Apple Watch. Just don’t expect it to be a massive upgrade over older Ultra models. fantastic screen, rugged yet sophisticated design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, three-day battery life, 5G and satellite SOS/messaging, top health tracking, great activity tracking with dual-band GPS, extra action button, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre dive-ready, long software support. very expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, no big upgrade on previous Ultra models, shorter battery life than adventure watch rivals.",Samuel Gibbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/30/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-dust-resistant-foldable-phone-screen-ai,Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold review: dust-resistant and more durable foldable phone,2025-10-30T07:00:55.000Z,"Book-style Android with cutting-edge AI, good cameras and great tablet screen for media and multitasking on the go The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. oogle’s third-generation folding phone promises to be more durable than all others as the first with full water and dust resistance while also packing lots of advanced AI and an adaptable set of cameras. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold builds on last year’s excellent by doing away with gears in the hinge along its spine allowing it to deal with dust, which has been the achilles heel of all foldable phones until now, gumming up the works in a way that just isn’t a problem for regular slab phones. But, as with all foldable phones, the Pixel is very expensive, costing £1,749 (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699), sitting far above the £1,199 and rubbing shoulders with the equally pricey Improved durability aside, not a lot has visibly changed on the outside since the 9 Pro Fold. The external screen is a smidgen larger thanks to thinner bezels, and the inside and outside screens are slightly brighter than before. The Fold is a great shape when closed for phone-based tasks and can comfortably fit two full-size apps side by side on the excellent internal screen when open. However, the Pixel is heavy and looks chunky compared with . It is 258g, which you can feel in use and the pocket, while being significantly thicker than a normal phone and the latest rivals. The Fold has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 line with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage. It performs just as well as the , feeling rapid in use and capable of handling most tasks without breaking a sweat. Those seeking the highest frame rates in high-end games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, however. As with all foldables, the battery life of the Fold varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. On light days with about five hours of active screen use spread equally between the inside and outside displays, mostly on wifi, the Pixel managed about 38 to 40 hours between charges. On heavier days on 5G with more inside screen use, it lasted about 28 hours, ending the day with 25% left in the tank. That’s not terrible but is some way behind the best rivals or big-screen slab phones, including the 48MP wide, 10.5MP ultrawide, 10.8MP 5x telephoto; two 10MP selfie cameras 5G, eSim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, UWB, Thread, GNSS IP68 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes) The Fold runs the same Android 16 software as the rest of the , which introduces a bold and colourful appearance plus lots of cutting-edge AI tools crammed into almost every corner of the phone. Some of the highlights include the Gemini chatbot, which can see and hear what you do, interact with your apps and is generally quite useful, plus a new real-time translation system for phone calls that replicates the caller’s voice. Magic Cue is the standout feature, which is a little helper that runs in the background on your device, processing your data from various Google apps and popping up with timely information when you need it. It understands context, so when a friend texts to ask about when your flight lands it will suggest your flight details from your calendar so you can paste them straight into your conversation, or when you call a business it will show your order details from Gmail right in the phone app. It is low-key great. It also has a few modifications to make the most of the big internal screen. A task bar at the bottom of the display makes putting apps into split screen easy. You can also resize apps beyond the border of the screen, similar to the , which adds a bit of flexibility to running two apps side by side. The Fold also comes with a subscription for for a year, worth £19 a month, granting access to more powerful Gemini AI models and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email. The phone will receive updates in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair The Pixel 10 Pro Fold contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the The 10 Pro Fold has a very similar camera set up to last year’s 9 Pro Fold and the new , including a 48-megapixel main, 10.5MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera, which out-zooms folding phone rivals, plus two 10MP selfie cameras. The main camera shoots good photos across a range of conditions, although it can suffer from a little blur and grain at lower light levels. Google’s night mode is still the best in the business when it gets really dark. The ultra-wide camera is solid, while the 5x optical zoom telephoto camera can meaningfully close the distance to objects. The latter can be a bit soft on detail in less than ideal light. Just like the the camera shoots good photos and video most will be pleased with, but it can’t match the , which for this price you might expect. The Fold has a few tricks of its own, including various shooting modes using both screens or propped up at angles when partly folded, plus the ability to shoot selfies with the main camera. The handy Made You Look feature shows an animation on the outside screen that reacts when your child looks its way and smiles, keeping their attention long enough for you to shoot a photo, although unfortunately it uses one of the selfie cameras, not the primary camera, so it’s more for fun than a great photo. The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs from The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is a minor update to the already good , but one that could have a bigger impact down the line. As the first properly dust-resistant foldable it sets a new durability benchmark, slowly bringing the devices up to par with standard slab phones. The inside screen is still necessarily softer than a regular hardened glass to allow it to fold, however, so you must still be careful with it. A fingernail can leave a permanent mark if you press hard enough. The added Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging support is just as good in the Fold as it is in . The phone is rapid, has reasonable battery life, runs great software and has the best cutting-edge AI around. The cameras are good for a foldable, too, although can’t match the best normal phones. The Pixel does a great job of balancing being a regular phone when closed and a great tablet when open, but it is fat and heavy compared with the dramatically thinner and lighter a phone and tablet in one, dust and water resistant, Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging, great tablet screen, good performance, good cameras with 5x zoom, packed with AI including Magic Cue, Google AI Pro included for a year, seven years of software updates. extremely expensive, more fragile and costlier to repair than a regular device, thick and heavy, cameras can’t match regular Pixel 10 Pro, battery life could be better, fewer power-user features than rivals.",Samuel Gibbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/lava-lamps-shopping-trends-mathmos-retail,‘Nostalgic and calming’: lava lamps are groovy again as sales glow,2025-12-25T08:00:37.000Z,"The British-made lamps have surged in popularity as younger audiences seek to recapture magic of the 1960s epending on your age, you may remember them from Doctor Who and The Prisoner in the 1960s, or from TFI Friday and the Big Breakfast in the 90s. Or if you’re young enough, you might not remember them at all. But now it seems lava lamps are back. Rising sales would suggest a third wave of the lava lamp phenomenon is on the horizon, thanks to the ongoing trend towards mid-century interiors and gen Z’s fascination with the late 90s and early 2000s. Cressida Granger, the managing director of the , said there had been a surge in interest in its lamps. “It feels like they’re in the current conversation in a way they haven’t been.” Sales have been rising steadily in recent years and 2025 is set to be a huge festive season. Mathmos has oversold in the run-up to Christmas, which means the company will be short of stock come January. So what does Granger put this appeal down to? “They’re sort of nostalgic, aren’t they? So that’s comforting when the world’s changing,” she said. “They are just very calming, they’re very analogue. They take two hours to warm up. They don’t demand anything of you, they’re very soothing. People use them for mindfulness and focus. “[In the case of Mathmos], people really like that we’re the real thing and they’ve always been made here and we invented them. So that feels also secure and authentic, and we really work hard to make them the best.” Mathmos was founded in 1963, by the inventor of the lava lamp, Edward Craven Walker. Walker was an eccentric, a nudist who was married four times before his death at the age of 82 in 2000. He was responsible for the early success of the company, which was then called Crestworth, with his wife Christine, but when sales collapsed in the 1980s, his successor Granger oversaw the renaissance. Formerly a vintage dealer, Granger initially approached Walker to buy the formula but ended up taking over the business in 1989. Though much about Mathmos has changed, the secret recipe is still loosely based on Walker’s designs and the bottles are still filled by hand. , bears all the quirks expected of somewhere making such an unusual product. Upstairs, customer service staff speak multiple languages to engage with customers from its 10 international websites. Downstairs, a mesmerising showroom of lava lamps of different colours and designs enraptures anyone who enters. Adjacent to that is where the magic happens, where the bottles are filled and the lava lamps are assembled – sometimes even personalised – and boxed, ready to be shipped in time for Christmas. The original model, the Astro with the classic lava lamp shape, is still the bestseller but others such as the rocket-shaped 90s Telstar are popular, and a number of newer models including ones lit by candles have also proved a success. “I suppose it is unusual to have a job that no one else really has in Europe,” says Alan Staton, the only person outside China who spends his working day putting the lava into the lamps. The “lava” is essentially a type of brightly coloured wax suspended in water, which is heated by a bulb and rises to the top, falling again when it cools, creating its characteristic hypnotic effect. Customers who bought a Mathmos lamp anytime in the last 30 years will have a product that was filled by Staton. His younger colleague Henry Currer has only worked at the factory for a few months – “I’m getting my head round it I think!” – having come from running a bronze casting factory in Birmingham. “What enticed me to it is that it’s a British heritage brand, something that’s made here,” he says. “Every other lava lamp’s made in China,” says Granger. There have been periods where innovative products were copied which devastated sales, and the small company did not have the funds for legal action. But Granger has a philosophical view: “If you’re not being copied you’re not doing anything successful. “We did a silicon ball that squeezed on and off, called Bubble, that got copied by Target in America. You can’t do a lot against Target. “But actually I spent a long time looking for the new lava lamp,” she says, “before I realised that the new lava lamp was the lava lamp.” The company has collaborated with various designers and artists, including the photographer Rankin, the band Duran Duran and the dutch designer Sabine Marcelis. Every one of these has sold out within hours, including most recently a limited edition red Rolling Stones collaboration, for which only 1,000 were made, which led to a huge queue at the band’s Carnaby Street store on the day it was released in November. “They were going for more money than people bought them for during the time we were selling them,” says Granger. Perhaps surprisingly, Mathmos’s customers are not one-offs. “They’ve often got more than one and they often gift them. We’ve got quite a big collecting community and they’re quite active. We do have some collectors who’ve got hundreds.” She says: “It’s like a vinyl record, you have to take it out of its sleeve and there’s a ceremony to it, which is kind of nice.”",Robyn Vinter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/23/three-mobile-network-account-ownership,Three mobile network seems to want to ‘kill off’ my sick dad,2025-06-23T06:00:03.000Z,"The company insists the only way to transfer account ownership from him to me is to say he is ‘deceased’ Incredible but true: Three seemingly wants to “kill off” a sick customer in order to name his daughter as the primary account holder for her own mobile phone. Change of ownership is a standard process offered by most telecoms providers. Without ownership, customers can’t cancel contracts or make other critical decisions. Three, in its responses to customers on its community forum who were in the same situation as you, has claimed that a system update two years ago meant it was unable to do this. It initially suggested to you that you take out a new contract with a new number, which suggested it has zero understanding of the significance of a lifelong phone number. It then advised you to wait until your father dies, since its bereavement team has miraculous powers denied to the rest of customer services and can do the deed. When you rejected these unpalatable options and complained to the chief executive’s office, it came up with its brainwave. You can tell from the tone of the email that it really thought this was compassion in action. The bereavement team, it proposed, would call your father with you present and, if he consented to be declared dead, it would complete the transfer process used for deceased customers. It would, it continued blithely, have to report your father as deceased to all the credit reference agencies, but it would later correct this on his credit file, although it would be unable to circumvent a marker on his record. “I really hope this will work for you,” the letter ended brightly. The insensitivity of Three’s proposal is breathtaking and the legal and financial ramifications potentially serious. I asked the credit reference agency Experian what the effect would be. Potentially serious, came the answer. “Firstly, it would likely cause problems with future applications because lenders will see the deceased marker, and it will usually lead to the application being refused,” said its consumer expert John Webb. “Secondly, if existing lenders check someone’s credit report, it could result in them closing the account completely.” At this point, a remarkable thing happened. I contacted Three and it discovered that it could “easily” transfer your name after all. Not only that – it declared that it always did have such a process and blamed an agent “knowledge gap” for saying that it didn’t. Now, that’s a lot of agents who have gappy knowledge. First, the online community support team that advised community web users – including parents with now-adult children and those whose contracts were in the name of an ex-spouse – that the only option was to port the number to a different provider, then port it back again under a new contract. Then the call centre and web chat agents and the complaint escalations team who, for two months, insisted to you that there was no process. Three even informed the ombudsman – after you took your complaint to it – that the system did not allow for it. When I put this to Three, it doubled down and insisted you had been incorrectly advised and that staff would be trained in the policy they knew nothing about. On my third request for clarification, it admitted that only those suffering bereavement (and financial hardship) qualified, which is what you were told all along. It said it would review its processes in light of your experience. Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, told me that it did not require providers to offer a change of ownership service, but it would contact Three, as companies are required to give support and empathy to customers in vulnerable situations. You now own the contract and have been offered (via me – Three initially forgot to tell you) a paltry £75 in goodwill. You are incredulous after finding the impossible was suddenly possible. “They’ve suddenly prioritised fixing the change of ownership and tried to act like there’s nothing to see here,” you said. “This has been a horrible few years for my family, and this was a simple admin action that could have saved us extra grief.”",Anna Tims,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/25/titanic-sinclair-c5-brexit-museum-of-failure-coming-uk,"The Titanic, Sinclair C5 and Brexit: the Museum of Failure is coming to the UK",2025-12-25T15:00:43.000Z,"Exhibition of design flops should suit British sense of humour, says its founder, but also shows failure is a part of learning Britain has been mismanaging inventions and ideas with impeccable style for centuries. Next spring, we will finally get a museum to celebrate the results: the Museum of Failure is coming to the UK. Its founder, Dr Samuel West, is anticipating a warm welcome: Britain, he said, was the museum’s spiritual home. “I’ve travelled all over the world with the museum but I’ve always wanted to bring it back home because of our black humour and our support of the underdog,” he said. “The Brits totally get it.” a travelling exhibition, is dedicated entirely to missteps, flops and aborted ambitions. Its collection spans failed gadgets, ill-fated design experiments, culinary disasters, corporate overreach – showcasing the messy, often hilarious side of innovation. Ben Strutt, an innovator who conducts workshops on how to turn failure into strategic wins, has visited the museum and said it could change the conversation about failure by normalising it. “Visitors will see how some of the biggest, most recognisable brands in the world have failed and how 42% of all startups fail,” he said. “They will also see how things failed in their time but were ultimately successful – like the paving the way for the iPhone, and doing the same for augmented reality wearables – or how better products fail while worse ones succeed, like Betamax and VHS,” he said. But it is not just for scoffing at. West stressed that the museum was not about ridicule but about understanding ambition, risk and the lessons embedded in collapse. He said that despite all the talk about constructive failure in Silicon Valley and “failing forward”, for most people failure remained taboo. “I want to reframe failure and show it is a universal and necessary part of innovation and learning,” he said. “The museum’s message is that we need to take bold meaningful risks to solve the largest problems of our times, environmental, social, economical. If we continue to glorify success and stigmatise failure we will not be able to experiment with and explore the solutions that we need.” Fiona Murden, a psychologist who has written about failure, said the museum could help people, especially young people, think differently about risk, creativity and resilience. But while glorifying success was a risk, she said, so was celebrating failure: “When failure is framed too positively, like it’s always a cool or enlightening experience, it can unintentionally send the message that failure is easy or without serious consequences. That risks invalidating the frustration, stress and setbacks people genuinely experience, which can be significant, especially in high-stakes or personal contexts.” West agreed that the degree to which failures are or are not tolerated is largely cultural. “A woman came up to me after a talk I gave in Ivory Coast and she was really angry and she was right to be,” he said. “She pointed out that I was approaching failure as a rich, white, privileged western male – that if she failed in her business, her entire family would be plunged into poverty. “It’s the same if you’re a guest worker in Dubai or Qatar on a contract: if you fail, it’s not just a matter of you doing a postmortem workshop to discover what went wrong. No, it’s your livelihood, it’s your family, it’s your visa,” he said. Failure is also understood differently across cultures. In China, visitors came to the museum so they could, they told West, laugh at failed western products. In South Korea, a risk-averse country, visitors were simply confused by what they perceived to be a celebration of failure. In the US, however, the museum was treated as a big joke. “In the US, failure is framed in the narrative of success, and so visitors there found the museum funny,” said West. “They just didn’t get it when I tried to tell them that sometimes failures lead nowhere; they’re painful and there’s no happy ending.” But in Britain, where the venue has yet to be confirmed, he suspects the reception will be more intuitive. “The British sense of humour embraces that sarcastic, dark awareness that things can just go horribly wrong,” he said.",Amelia Hill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/dec/25/why-shared-parental-leave-monumental-dud-policy,Why shared parental leave is a monumental dud of a policy,2025-12-25T16:00:43.000Z,"Ten years on, it’s only used by a small percentage of parents – and many fathers haven’t even heard of the policy Jo Swinson was eight months pregnant to revolutionise the lives of parents at home and at work. The moment her “baby in government” was emotional, she told the Guardian. Little wonder, then, that she stops short of calling the policy a failure. It is difficult to be brutally honest about your offspring. And shared parental leave was, as she says, a first step. Thousands of families have been able to share leave as a result of the measures she helped usher in, and their lives have been changed for the better. But despite its promise and the best intentions of those that brought it forward, shared parental leave (SPL) was not just a missed opportunity, but a monumental dud of a policy. Ten years since its inception, only about 5% of eligible men and 1% of eligible women use it. Freedom of information requests made by the Guardian to four of the UK’s biggest public sector employers show that just 1.55% of parental leave requests made in the last five years were for SPL. According to the last , 45% of fathers had not heard of the policy at all. Why? Mainly because SPL – which gives parents the right to split up to 52 weeks’ leave, including up to 39 weeks of statutory shared parental pay – . Many companies (who are still ) offer enhanced pay for mothers, but not fathers. Families with fathers or partners who take SPL often have to take a big financial hit. It is fiendishly complicated, and even most HR professionals have little idea how it works. Dads also have no specific allocated leave, no days they can say are “theirs”. Given the cost and the hassle, is it any wonder most couples swerve? Unlike other failing policies that are reforged and rebuilt to improve effectiveness, SPL has been left to languish. A built-in bias towards richer couples has only compounded over the years. Last year, a full 95% of SPL was taken by dads in the top half of earners, . The proportion of middle and low earners taking SPL has dropped every year since the policy’s inception. In fact, the existence of SPL has arguably made things worse for families, by providing a fig leaf to pathetically low paternity pay in the UK. Dads and non-birthing partners get two weeks on the minimum wage. That is the worst statutory paternity leave in Europe and ranks . Taking those precious two weeks costs don’t take any leave at all? There are some glimmers of hope. In July, the government announced an 18-month until later down the line). But, most importantly, a campaign supported by longtime female stalwarts but MPs – both male and female – for dads, with many supporting at least a month of paid leave reserved for fathers and co-parents. Equality campaigners like the have long argued that a levelling of the domestic field is vital for tackling entrenched gender equalities that leave women Does this matter? Yes. The benefits of both parents taking time out to spend time with their babies is well documented. Dads who take leave with their babies There has been a lost decade of progress on shared parental leave; parents of the future will hope that change is finally on the way.",Alexandra Topping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/24/tg-jones-brand-replaced-wh-smith-high-street,‘I’ll never say I’m popping to Jones’s’: shoppers yet to feel love for WH Smith’s high street replacement,2025-12-24T12:00:10.000Z,"TG Jones took over stores six months ago but consumers have noticed little change or investment t’s just the same.” Six months on from the , the name above the door may have changed to TG Jones, but many shoppers have not noticed a splurge of investment or change. “The layout is the same and what they are selling is the same,” says Gillian Parsons as she exits TG Jones on a busy high street in the market town of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, where a steady flow of visitors are picking up cards, wrapping paper and the odd present in the week before Christmas. “Even the branding is similar,” says Jazz Minhas, another shopper. Others had not even noticed the had changed – such was the similarity of the signage, which sticks to a similar blue. However, shoppers are not really feeling the same vibe as under the brand. “I loved Smiths. I used to say to my husband: ‘I’m just popping down to Smiths’ but I’ll never be able to say: ‘I’m popping to Jones’s,’” says Parsons, who admits she is not so regular a visitor as she used to be, picking up books elsewhere and getting her newspapers delivered. The private equity company Modella Capital, the owner of Hobbycraft, the UK arm of Claire’s and The Original Factory Shop, bought WH Smith’s high street arm in June for up to £40m, half of which is dependent on trading up until August next year. The price was cut by £12m at the last moment after “a period of softer trading”. The business is now totally separate from the travel retail arm, which retained the WH Smith name, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and continues to trade in airports, stations and hospitals. Its after accounting problems at its US operation. In a recent presentation to landlords seen by the Guardian, Modella promised to invest in expanding TG Jones to be the “hub of the high street” with 500 outlets that would combine post office and banking services with learning, play and reading products. The plan appears to be to expand into new locations, with some parts of the UK, such as north-east England and the East Midlands sparsely covered with stores compared with the south. Visitors are to be tempted in with refits. However, only 14 of the group’s 456 stores so far have been revamped, with 10 more definitely planned, according to the presentation. Store updates are also set to include more post offices, on top of four added since the deal, and branded sections from Modella’s other businesses Claire’s and Hobbycraft, and its partner Toys R Us. Toys R Us, for example, is in 115 TG Jones stores, according to the presentation, and it expects to increase that to more than 250 – the same number of stores set to host a Hobbycraft section by 2027. It may have gone unnoticed in Hitchin, but there are small changes creeping into the former WH Smith outlets, including a small new section dedicated to goods from Hobbycraft and Toys R Us and a section for “DIY essentials”. However, since the deal was first announced in March, 24 stores have closed – including nine since the deal was completed in June – as TG Jones has continued a programme of closures already under way by WH Smith. Shoppers say they will need more changes if they are to be tempted to spend more and keep TG Jones afloat amid rising costs on the high street. “It’s not what it was when you could buy records and toys and it was slick. It doesn’t really know what it is. I’d like to see more arts stuff and stationery. Books and toys everyone can get cheaper elsewhere,” Jon Wright says. Shoppers admit they are more likely to buy many of the items sold in TG Jones online or at rivals including The Range, Poundland, Waterstones or big supermarkets – where they can get cheaper prices or more choice. “It’s more convenient to shop at the supermarket,” say sisters Tracy Ward and Lisa Bierton. “I tend to go to cheaper shops for cards,” Ward says. “People don’t tend to get cards as often, as a stamp costs more than the card these days.” Trading on UK high streets has been tough in the run-up to Christmas, when WH Smith used to make the majority of its profits, with shoppers reining in the present buying and sending fewer cards as the energy and grocery bills remain high and fears about tax rises and other factors such as the war in Ukraine and the economic outlook prompt households to hold on to spare cash. Earlier this month, Card Factory delivered an unwelcome early Christmas surprise for investors by issuing a during the cut-price greetings card retailer’s peak trading period, which sent shares plunging by more than a fifth. One retail property expert said he believed Modella would radically restructure TG Jones in July next year once a 12-month prohibition on such steps agreed as part of the deal with WH Smith comes to an end. He said such a move would be necessary because a large estate, with many sites on the borderline of profitability, risked “being eaten from the tail” as investments in key stores were offset by problems in the wider estate. “They can dominate the market in some smaller areas but in bigger malls they are up against the likes of Miniso [on toys] and The Works on stationery and books.” Another retail insider who knows the business well said TG Jones might well have been helped by changes to business rates in the budget that helped keep a lid on costs for many high street outlets but said store closures were likely, with as many as 100 at risk. “It’s inevitable that the shape of that business will change,” the source said, as retail profits are under pressure and the cost of refurbishing ageing outlets is high and without a guaranteed payback. TG Jones and Modella were contacted for comment. The chain’s previous owner, WH Smith, may have responded to heavy criticism about its flooring and tatty shelves with a round of investment in recent years but many outlets still look out of date after a long period of cost-cutting. TG Jones in Stevenage, for example, appears almost identical to its WH Smith days, suggesting it is among a list of sites under threat. “Back in the day I used to shop in WH Smith,” says Wayne Garland, 49, standing outside the store, which sits in a struggling outdoor mall where there are a number of empty units. “But now it’s too expensive when I can go to Poundland and buy 10 pens for £1. With the cost of living crisis, I’m looking for bargains bottom line.” Marion and Craig Herbert agree there are now cheaper and handier alternatives. “We do quite a bit online now. The world has changed,” Marion says.",Sarah Butler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/closure-shareholder-revolt-register-uk-listed-firms-executive-pay-controversies,End of shareholder revolt register ‘will help UK firms bury pay controversies’,2025-12-25T15:00:42.000Z,"Fears for transparency and governance after closure of public log meant to curb ‘abuses and excess’ in boardrooms UK-listed companies will be able to bury controversies over executive pay for the first time in eight years, a thinktank has warned, after the Labour government shut down a public tracker meant to curb “abuses and excess in the boardroom”. The public register was launched under the Tory prime minister Theresa May in 2017 to name and shame companies hit by shareholder revolts at their annual general meetings (AGMs). That included rebellions over issues such as excessive bonuses or salary increases for top earning bosses. However, the Treasury – under the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – instructed the Investment Association (IA), the UK asset management trade body that maintained the register, this autumn as part of a wider regulation action plan to increase economic growth by cutting “red tape” for businesses. The closure of the public log follows lobbying , whose bosses claim bad publicity over executive pay is harming the City’s competitiveness and deterring UK listings. , a thinktank, is warning the move will harm transparency and make it easier for companies listed on the FTSE to dismiss investors’ concerns, starting in the 2026 annual shareholder meetings season. “This is worrying, from our perspective,” Paddy Goffey, a researcher at the thinktank, said. “This would make it more likely that significant cases of shareholder dissent on issues of pay, governance and wider strategy will go unnoticed.” About 26% of FTSE 100 companies have had a shareholder rebellion against executive pay over the past three years. Dissent is considered a shareholder rebellion if 20% or more of the vote is against a specific resolution. “This reflects the significant levels of dissent within shareholder votes and how crucial such information is for investors and other stakeholders,” Goffey said. The High Pay Centre acknowledged corporate reporting rules could be burdensome and complex, and should be streamlined. However, that should not include discontinuing tools such as the register that provided genuine value to stakeholders, the thinktank said. The closure added to other “worrying trends” around corporate transparency such as the shift to online-only AGMs. Rather than closing the register, companies should be forced to provide more detailed explanations about the reason for shareholder dissent and how their boards planned to respond in the future, the High Pay Centre said. “Ultimately, discontinuing the register will make it much harder and more time-consuming to gather the relevant data and information, as such data could be ‘buried’ in complex filings, AGM results or lengthy reports,” it added. The decision illustrates the significant cultural shift that has taken place across the City since the May government launched the world’s first public log of dissenting shareholder votes in order to “restore public confidence in big business”. “It [the register] definitely had a role in holding companies to account in the early years, especially on remuneration, and for a while companies truly did worry about the prospect of being named on the register,” said Yousif Ebeed, the corporate governance lead at the assent managers Schroders. “And at the time, there was a sense that companies were not giving sufficient weight to shareholder concerns. The register helped shine a light on these companies, to an extent kickstarting an environment where transparency and shareholder engagement have become embedded practice.” Fast forward to 2025, and City campaigners are raising fears that the UK is losing out on investment to the US, where Donald Trump has embarked on a “bonfire of regulation” in an attempt to lure money and business. The UK Treasury said in October tit was “grateful to the IA for establishing the register following a request from government” but that the public log had “served its purpose”. The Treasury added that the corporate governance code “already offered transparency for investors”. Ebeed said most institutional investors would remain “unaffected”. However, at a time when the government is pushing for more of the public to buy up UK shares, there is a fear that small retail investors could be left at a disadvantage. “The reduction in transparency and knowledge on company practice could reduce the ability of investors to make informed decisions,” Goffey said. “Having all this data in one place also makes it easier to track discontent, identify trends and compare companies or sectors. It is plausible that, with the raising of the barrier to holding companies accountable in this way, they [companies] will be less likely to take such dissent seriously and respond appropriately.”",Kalyeena Makortoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inquiry into the wrongful convictions of hundreds of post office operators announced in September that it was as part of a legacy project to commemorate the devastating impact of the scandal. But many victims, who have been advising the inquiry’s , are highly suspicious of the idea of an exhibition. Katie Burrows, daughter of Elaine Hood, a Derby post office operator who was wrongly convicted of theft in 2002, said she had been “deeply traumatised” by a meeting at the museum to discuss the idea. She said: “I felt a bit coerced. It was set up as a PR stunt. I don’t want to endorse something that I just don’t think is right.” Burrows and others are troubled that the museum is part-funded by the Nichola Arch, a former post office operator who was wrongly accused of stealing £26,000 from the Post Office, also attended the meeting. She said: “While they’re taking money from the Post Office, they won’t win our trust, and nothing the museum will do will change that.” Alistdair Brown, whose 92-year-old mother, Betty, is the oldest wrongly convicted post office operator, said: “The general reaction from subpostmasters was that they never want to be seen in the place as its far too close to the Post Office headquarters at Mount Pleasant. It’s almost like walking back into some kind of prison again.” An inquiry spokesperson said the idea of working with the museum came from discussions with a focus group of post office operators, as one aspect of its legacy project. They said: “We appreciate that discussing the devastating impact of the scandal can be difficult for people, and we are grateful to everyone who has engaged and shared their views. We look forward to continuing to work with them on this and other aspects of the project.” Laura Wright, chief executive of the Postal Museum, said: “It is vitally important that those impacted by the scandal are able to tell their stories in their own way and have them preserved for the future. It is our aim to partner with those affected, with care and over time, to recognise and honour their experiences in ways that are led by their wishes. “Not all will want to continue to be involved, and there will be others not part of the original focus group who will also want to share their stories. Building trust will take time.” charity to support the families and dependents affected by the faulty Horizon IT system, said attending the museum to discuss a possible exhibition “felt like betraying people”. After the museum meeting she said her charity’s lawyer had informed the inquiry she would not support working with the museum. Burrows said: “I thought it was going to be meeting about sharing ideas, as we had done before. But it was all set up as though it had already been agreed, which it hadn’t. And it was . There have been loads of ideas about how to mark the legacy, and never once has the Postal Museum been suggested.” Brown said: “None of the subpostmaster representatives have called for this. It was something that came directly from the inquiry.” Burrows said she had had an “anxiety attack” in the museum and was “triggered” by the Post Office-themed toys on sale in the shop. She said: “I was 13 when my mum was convicted. Seeing all the Post Office memorabilia really bought it back to me. I used to love Postman Pat because I was really proud that my mum worked for the Post Office. But all that was suddenly taken away from me as a child. “How can a museum set up to celebrate the Post Office properly represent something that put hundreds of families in such a horrible situation?” Tracey Merritt, a former post office operator in Wincanton who has been forced to , said she was upset that there was currently no mention of post office operators in the museum. “I said: ‘It’s taken us being treated so badly for you to actually consider putting us in a museum’. You can’t celebrate a company and then show what they’ve done to us in the same light.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that claims made for fares booked via ScotRail and Greater Anglia’s website, as well as by a third-party ticketing site, My Train Ticket, were misleading. In all three cases, the ASA said, it found the companies could not provide evidence to show that people would get the lowest available price by booking train tickets through them. A ScotRail website had told customers that they could “get cheapest tickets”, “book direct for the best price” and that is was “unbeatable on price”. Greater Anglia’s website contained the claim “book direct for lowest prices”. While both firms argued that their sites highlighted the cheapest prices available on the day, and had no booking fees, the ASA said that “best price” claims needed to be backed up by evidence to show that retailers “would always beat, and not merely match, competitors’ prices”. In fact, under industry rules, operators are not permitted to create or sell their own train fares, the ASA said. The ASA further found that in some instances, Greater Anglia’s prices could be bettered by split ticketing, or buying separate tickets for segments of a journey. The rulings followed a similar verdict , which the ASA found had breached its code by promising customers they would not find cheaper prices elsewhere. Claire Dickie, ScotRail’s commercial director, said: “Our aim is always to provide clear, accurate information to customers, and we regret that the website messages did not fully reflect the ASA’s requirements. We will further review our processes to make sure we maintain the highest standards of compliance. “ScotRail remains committed to offering great value for money and helping customers find the best fare for their journey, including through the removal of peak fares, a wide range of discounts, and simple, easy-to-use booking systems.” My Train Ticket said it welcomed the ASA ruling, adding that it regularly reviews and updates its website “to ensure it provides accurate, clear, and impartial information for our customers”. George Eckton, a rail commuter based in Glasgow and longstanding campaigner for better fare information, who had complained to the ASA, said: “The ASA ruling against Greater Anglia really matters because it shows something quite simple: the company was promising passengers the lowest prices even though it couldn’t prove that was true on its own website. “Passengers shouldn’t have to second‑guess whether a ‘best price’ claim is actually true … something the new Great British Railways needs to quickly address.” Greater Anglia declined to comment. After the ASA ruling, the wording on its website has been changed. The government has pledged to overhaul the confusing fares system and create its own national ticketing website as it sets up",Gwyn Topham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In theory, conditions should have been perfect for bitcoin if, like gold, it is supposed to be a store of value in uncertain times.

Or, if you take the view that bitcoin is a hedge against currency debasement by governments, the news flow ought to have been encouraging. The US budget deficit remains enormous: the International Monetary Fund predicts the , or more than Greece and Italy. Alternatively, if bitcoin is meant to be a vehicle for tech-related enthusiasm, the artificial intelligence revolution should have offered semi-helpful breezes.

If JP Morgan and BlackRock are referring to bitcoin as a regular class of asset, something of the revolutionary spirit is lost. Google searches for “bitcoin” are merely steady these days. Even Elon Musk has other things to tweet about. As the chart shows, the paths of gold and bitcoin only properly diverged in October during a rapid sell-off in the latter. Precisely what happened on 10 October is still debated, but large selling by leveraged holders of bitcoin into a thin market, in reaction to a Trump tariff threat towards China, is part of the story. The point, though, is that bitcoin didn’t bounce back afterwards, as stocks and precious metals did. The crypto market as a whole shed . From a high of $126,000 in early October, bitcoin now stands at roughly $87,000. In a research note a month ago, Deutsche Bank analysts offered five factors as an explanation of the fall: a broader “risk-off” sentiment in markets in October, hawkish signals on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, less regulatory momentum than expected, thin liquidity and outflows from institutions, and profit-taking by long-term holders. Its conclusion: “Whether bitcoin stabilises after this correction remains uncertain. Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year’s downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments and global macro trends.” For true bitcoin believers every setback is a buying opportunity. Their faith tends to be unshakable and, given how the cryptocurrency has recovered from falls in previous years, one can’t say they are definitely wrong. Yet it does also feel as if something cracked this year. When demand was high for a proper defensive hedge, investors preferred gold (and silver, which performed even better) over computer code that has failed to take off as a medium of exchange.

https://www.theguardian.com/start-your-adventure/2025/dec/19/city-break-tips-five-ways-to-make-the-most-of-your-trip,‘Don’t try to do everything’ – and four other expert tips on how to get the most out of your city break,2025-12-19T09:42:36.000Z,"From smart luggage choices to how to find the best local cuisine, travel writer Sarah Gordon shares her expertise on how to ace your next city getaway A city break is perfect for a short, sharp shot of culture. It’s brief enough that nobody needs to ask for too much annual leave and long enough to be a refreshing getaway. With limited time, you want to make sure you get the most out of it – and because of that a little planning can go a long way. I’ve spent 20 years writing about travel, and city breaks are one of my favourite types of trip. Here are a few tips I’ve picked up along the way. I tend to travel with hand luggage only so I can step straight off the plane and hop easily on to my chosen mode of transport into the city. There are three things I never travel without: a power bank for my phone, because maps, translator apps and taking endless photos all drain my battery pretty quickly; a light rucksack that packs flat in my cabin bag on the way out but gives me extra space for souvenirs on the way back (check your airline allows an additional small bag); I also find a light scarf has a multitude of uses – I’ve used mine as a towel after an impromptu swim in Copenhagen’s harbour, as well as to cover summer shoulders when visiting churches in Rome. With the latter in mind, it pays to do a little research ahead of time to check cultural sensitivities – it also helps make sure you pack for any extra adventures you may end up adding to the museum visits and meals out. And before you head off to the airport, it always pays to do a final check that you’ve packed the essentials before you leave the house: your (in-date) passport, phone and credit cards. Speaking of which, it’s worth considering rewards cards that could help you get the most out of a trip. With the Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card you can earn while you’re exploring – Cardmembers earn two Marriott Bonvoy® points for every £1 spent on the Card, and a generous six points for every £1 spent at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy, which can be redeemed on future stays. All of which means you can enjoy your holiday to the full while gathering points for your next one. Plus, you may be eligible for a Free Night Award, depending on how much you spend throughout the year. A wheeled suitcase in cabin bag size is generally the easiest option – although each airline has its own spec, so always do a quick check on the airline website. If you’re looking to buy a new bag, you could consider a suitcase with shoulder straps, which doubles as a rucksack. Mine has helped me no end when crossing picturesque, cobbled old towns to find my accommodation. And if you have hours to kill before your return flight and nowhere to leave your luggage, there is a proliferation of luggage storage options. There are several apps that are ready to point you to shops and businesses that will look after your case for just a few pounds. Remember, less is very often more. It can be tempting to pack your itinerary with things to see. After all, time is short and there’s great new exhibition on, and a friend said you absolutely had to visit market. But then you find yourself lingering over coffee and suddenly you have to dash across the city to get to your next sight. So make a plan for those must-see spots, keeping a couple of ideas in reserve as a “nice to see” if you have time. Try to visit things that are geographically close on the same day. And remember, some key sights get booked up months in advance. So if you want to go to the Alhambra in Granada or visit the Vatican in Rome, try to book well ahead online so you have your visit secured. Remember, too, that after a busy few days of sightseeing, it can be a good idea to factor in some downtime before your holiday ends. The Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card includes automatic Marriott Bonvoy® Silver Elite status, which features perks such as Priority Late Checkout (subject to availability), so you can take it easy with a relaxing start on your last day. The most rewarding travel experiences often come when we immerse ourselves in the daily life of the city. I’ve found fabulous coffee spots when strolling through neighbourhoods, and nothing beats a market for picking up local produce and enjoying a makeshift picnic in a nearby park. A chat with staff at bars and cafes can reveal some hidden spots, so ask them where they like to go. And look out for event posters. I ended up at the most authentic flamenco performance at a bar down a tiny street in Seville when I spotted an advert pasted on a lamppost. A little research online can also help pinpoint where the locals are hanging out. I use translation apps to search in the target language. Cuisine is a veritable gateway to the heart of a destination and it doesn’t have to be fancy. Street food is a great way to eat on the go while experiencing the authentic flavours of your destination. Pick up a sweet, sumptuous – a folded “wallet pizza” – in Naples. In Malta’s capital, Valletta, are flaky pastry pockets filled with ricotta cheese or peas, while the morning after the night before in Madrid is perked up with crunchy deep-fried Or, if you’d prefer to wind down after a busy day of excursions, you don’t need to go far. If you’re staying with Marriott Bonvoy, you can book in for a relaxing evening with dinner at your hotel, helping you to feel refreshed for the next day’s adventure. And if you have a Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card, you can redeem your points on dining-in. Finally, I always make sure to reserve one great local foodie experience before I travel. If it’s popular, you’re unlikely to be able to walk in off the street. On a recent trip to Athens, it was , a tiny spot with the freshest local ingredients that a Greek friend had recommended. By reserving a table at that of-the-moment trattoria or trending cocktail bar, you’ll know you have one fancy night out and the rest of your meals can be left to enjoy in a more relaxed and spontaneous way.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Criminals often exploit long winter-nights as they look to break into sites, hoping to make off with the most costly tools and equipment stored there. “Darkness helps thieves to move in the shadows,” said Paul Worsley, the chief services officer at Kingdom Services, which runs temporary CCTV for more than 100 construction sites across Scotland and northern England. “They use the Christmas period as an opportunity because construction sites close for a longer period and there is less chance of them being spotted by someone coming on to site.” Construction site thefts have soared amid the cost of living crisis, Worsley said, while the greater availability of battery-powered, cordless angle grinders has led to more thieves attempting to break the locks of buildings or storage cabins. The National Federation of Builders (NFB), a trade organisation that represents regional contractors and small- and medium-sized housebuilders, has calculated tool theft costs the industry almost £100m a year and has put traders and companies out of business. “I have never met a member who has not had an issue with tool theft or site theft,” said Rico Wojtulewicz, the head of policy and market insight at the NFB . “One member suffered two incidents of theft during last year’s Christmas period. He said he is not looking forward to this year.” In the past, thieves have targeted copper cables, steel and piping. However, they are increasingly going after tools and equipment, which industry representatives believe signals the involvement of organised criminal groups. “They have the ability to get this equipment started, they know how to drive it,” said Worsley. “To move big plant equipment on, you have to know what you are doing.” The Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) is calling for greater deterrents for thieves. A bill proposing of tool theft is making its way through parliament. “Many small- and medium-sized enterprises are already feeling the burden of increased costs and chasing payments, so the cost of having to replace their tools can be difficult to bear at any time, least of all Christmas,” said David Barnes, the head of policy and public affairs at the CIOB. Security companies say good lighting may deter some thieves, while they also advise that construction firms group containers or storage units in one area in the centre of a site away from fences, to allow better monitoring.",Joanna Partridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/25/uk-electric-car-charger-ev-switch-sales,UK electric car charger rollout slows amid worries over EV switch,2025-12-25T10:00:36.000Z,"Smallest number of new chargers since 2022 as carmakers persuade government to weaken EV sales targets The UK’s rollout of electric car chargers slackened markedly in 2025 amid investor concerns over a slower-than-expected switch to cleaner battery vehicles. There were 87,200 chargers installed in the UK at the end of November, an increase of 13,500 compared with the end of 2024, according to data from Zapmap, which tracks charger installations. That represented the smallest number of new chargers installed in the UK since 2022, and put the industry on track for growth of less than 20%, down from . It would be the slowest annual growth in the decade since installations started to take off. The number of electric cars sold is still growing rapidly, accounting for 23% of British sales in the first 11 months of 2025 – up from 19% at the same point last year. However, growth has . Some manufacturers have slowed their switch from petrol to electric, while some investors in charging infrastructure have also slowed down. Carmakers persuaded the UK government to weaken electric car sales targets despite that lower sales would imperil investment. Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank, said the slowdown in charger installations this year was “no surprise” given the “rather mixed messages on EVs” from the UK government, including a , announced at last month’s budget. “Its weakening of the zero emission vehicle mandate could incentivise the sale of plug-in hybrids rather than EVs,” he said. “And while it won’t change the fact that EVs will remain considerably cheaper to run, the 3p per mile tax on EVs risks undermining consumer confidence. All of this could slow EV sales considerably, which, in turn, could undermine business confidence and slow investment in the public charging infrastructure this country needs.” There were 48,100 slow chargers at the end of November, an increase of 15% over the year. The number of ultra-rapid chargers, which tend to be used for quick top-ups on longer journeys, rose 39% to about 9,800. More and more people are buying electric cars, and are having to grapple with charging for the first time. However, not all chargers are created equal, and the profusion of units can cause confusion. Charging speeds are measured by power output in kilowatts (kW), while battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh). For example, a Nissan Leaf has 39kWh of battery capacity, while a Tesla Model Y has 60kWh. Recharge times vary depending on battery size: divide the battery size by the power to get a very rough idea of how many hours it will take to charge. (E.g., a 60kWh battery at a 22kW charger would take about three hours.) The quicker the charge, the more it tends to cost. Common at homes, on-street chargers and places cars hang around like car parks or hotels. Suitable for charging overnight. Plugging in with a UK three-pin plug to the mains at home will deliver about 2.3kW – although it is not recommended. Found at urban sites like supermarkets, shopping centres or car parks. Capable of charging a smaller battery in a few hours. Typically found close to big roads for journey charging, but also increasingly found in locations such as supermarkets or gyms with short dwell times. 50kW could give 80% charge in less than an hour. Most chargers being installed at motorway services or dedicated charging hubs are now at least 150kW.  Many newer cars can now handle 150kW, and several can charge at speeds of over 300kW, adding hundreds of miles of range in around 10 minutes. Vicky Read, the chief executive of ChargeUK, a lobby group for the charging industry, said that there had been fewer installations than the industry wanted of slow chargers, which tend to be used to charge more cheaply overnight. “Across the market charge point operators have been facing rapidly rising costs, which has impacted the pace of the rollout in some more commercially challenging locations, while grid connections continue to hold back installations,” she said. Some analysts believe that the UK’s charger rollout is on track. The supply of public charging across Great Britain remains ahead of demand by 1.5 years, according to analysis in September by , a non-profit research body. However, rapid chargers by motorways for longer journeys are much more developed: existing charge points could cope with demand for the next six years without any more added, Cenex said. Read said delayed local electric vehicle infrastructure (Levi) funding for councils would start arriving in bulk in 2026 and 2027, helping installations to accelerate again. She said: “To ensure we stay on track as we make this transition, we need to have the government’s support to reduce the cost burden – which is affecting driver prices as well as pace of rollout – and to remove the bottlenecks like connecting to the grid.” Despite the UK’s progress in charger installations, the regional variations remain large. Northern Ireland, the poorest region in the UK, has only 39 public chargers for each 100,000 people, compared with 301 for London, according to Zapmap data last updated in October. Northern Ireland, the East Midlands and north-east England were the slowest regions for charger installations per person in the year to October. Melanie Shufflebotham, the Zapmap chief operating officer, said there was still “strong growth in ultra-rapid charging”. “Charge point operators face challenges as the tender and commercial contract process for the Levi fund have taken longer than anticipated, and in parallel, there are also concerns in terms of accessing grid connections in a timely fashion,” she added.",Jasper Jolly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether you’re rafting, surfing or mountain biking, adventure travel gets you out into nature and out of your comfort zone – it makes your holiday more memorable, and your relaxation time feel so much sweeter. I can’t think of the last holiday I went on that didn’t involve some kind of outdoor or ocean-based adventure. Maybe it was in early childhood when my parents tried to take me around their choice of city-based museums a few times before realising we’d all have a far more relaxing trip if we chose holidays centred around the beach, where I would spend all day playing in the waves. I still love being in the sea, and surfing is one of my favourite pastimes. There are so many incredible places around the world for wave riding – from Sydney’s iconic Bondi beach (where I visited as a youthful backpacker), to Seminyak, a beach resort area at the southern end of Bali – that it can be difficult to choose one destination when you’re booking a holiday. Seminyak is a popular destination for surfers of all ability levels. Stay at the , a vibrant hotel just a short walk from the beach and a stone’s throw from some of Bali’s finest bars and restaurants. Alternatively, Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Cardmembers can accumulate 6 points for every £1 spent at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy, so you could use your Card to dine at the hotel’s restaurant, savouring local and international flavours – ideal for those who have built an appetite after a busy day in the surf. And with two points for every £1 spent elsewhere, using your Marriott Bonvoy® Amex® Card means that whatever you spend can also help towards your next surfing trip. And there are other activities aside from surfing. Guests can try their hand at kitesurfing or wakeboarding lessons, or even travel to the island’s tropical jungle-rich interior for a mountain bike trip, including a descent down a volcano. In fact research has found that for adventure-seeking holidaymakers. And for me, it’s easy to see why. When I was younger, my most memorable travel experiences were mountain biking on boulder-strewn trails in South Africa’s Western Cape and through black lava fields beneath Bali’s Mount Batur, hiking amid wonderful canyons in Chiapas, Mexico, and the jagged peaks of Poland’s Tatra mountains. If you are after a more leisurely cycling holiday, albeit still one filled with adventures, head to Copenhagen, one of the world’s most bike-friendly capitals. Explore this outdoorsy city on two-wheels, taking in its beaches, its famed harbour baths, and traditional Danish fare, such as open-faced rye sandwiches all while collecting Marriott Bonvoy® points as you go – which you can redeem for future stays, experiences and more. Whether you choose to stay at a hotel participating in Marriott Bonvoy, such as (you can rent bikes at reception) on the waterfront, or the , a Member of Design Hotels, housed in an historic building that once served as the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music, the Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card will help elevate your stay. All Cardmembers automatically start with Silver Elite status, which includes perks such as Priority Late Checkout (subject to availability) And after all that cycling, your legs might thank you for a later start. You can upgrade to Gold Elite status with even more benefits when you spend £15,000 in a year as a Marriott Bonvoy Amex Cardmember. I am fortunate in that my children (aged 12 and 14) and husband are as hungry for adventure as I am. Our highlight trips have included a surf and safari adventure in Sri Lanka and climbing via ferratas in the French Alps. This summer, we’re planning to go rafting and on an overnight bivouac hike in the French Pyrenees. And it appears, with our thirst for adventure, we’re not alone. More holidaymakers than ever are looking to book trips which include unique and immersive thrill-seeking activities, and that trend is set to accelerate over the next decade, .

The price of a second-class stamp has in five years to 75p. Over the same period a first-class stamp is With budgets under strain from the cost of living crisis, retailers say consumers are being creative, either buying singles for close relatives and friends or getting out the craft scissors and glue stick for the ultimate personal touch. John Lewis says sales of single cards are up 36%, while Hobbycraft and The Works have experienced strong demand for blank cards, stampers and festive-shaped stickers. “We think the cost of postage may mean shoppers are sending fewer cards and instead taking the time to make personalised creations for their closest friends and family,” said Lisa Lort-Johnson, head of buying at The Works. “This year, we’ve noticed customers purchasing more embellishments to use for creative card-making versus traditional packs of pre-made cards.” In a move precipitated by the pandemic, Card Aid no longer opens the pop-up shops in church halls and empty stores that once sold huge quantities of Christmas cards for a wide range of charities at this time of year. These days supporters are encouraged to buy “We had wonderful years generating hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity,” said Hilary Blume, director of the Charities Advisory Trust, which is behind the Card Aid initiative. “We stopped because people weren’t buying cards.” In its heyday, Card Aid used to get its stock ready to sell at October half-term “so people could get organised” with the average purchase being about 30 cards. “It was a huge thing… but life isn’t like that now,” continued Blume. “If the [postal] service is so terrible and it is £1.25 a knock, plus the cost of the card, why would you do it? Are you going to go out and spend £40 or £50 on Christmas cards?” Even if it is no longer the norm to have a mantelpiece crowded with cards or strung on ropes around the room, Britons are still prolific card senders. With large numbers Christmas cards sold by schools and in charity shops, the total exchanged is hard to estimate. However, the Greeting Card Association (GCA) puts the figure at a surprisingly high 1bn a year. Amanda Fergusson, the GCA’s chief executive, said sending a card was a “very British thing”, with the overall single-card market, which includes birthday cards, at £1.5bn last year. While some people might be sending fewer cards at Christmas, she said its research found that 18- 34-year-olds were sending more than a generation ago. “Cards are part of the fabric of our life in the UK.” She added: “When I was young, my mother would come home with a box of 50 or 100 Christmas cards and we’d all sit around the table and write them. Today people put more effort into choosing either small-batch cards or individual cards for special people. “Postage costs have an impact,” Fergusson added, but being able to send a card anywhere in the UK for 75p “still represents good value”. Even if the sacks of Christmas cards being delivered by the Royal Mail are smaller these days, the annual trade is still a money-spinner for Scout Post, its mini rival. A Scouts spokesperson said the unofficial mail service was thriving, with 50 operating around the country this year. With an average charge of 40p a card, Scout Post is an important source of funds, he said, adding: “Some schemes involve single scout groups covering a village, others join together to operate over a larger area. We anticipate around 250,000 cards will be delivered in the run-up to Christmas.”",Zoe Wood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/auf-wiedersehen-pets-duckett-and-bethell-were-briefly-back-in-town-but-failings-lie-at-the-top,Duckett and Bethell were dangled out to dry by failings of a slack setup,2025-12-26T14:00:15.000Z,"No rational judge could have expected England’s fall guys to succeed at the MCG where they were thrown on to a festive bonfire Guess who just got back today? Those wild-eyed boys that had been away. This was a day of brittle, over-caffeinated cricket, on an MCG pitch streaked with faint green ridges. But it was also a day when the boys were, however briefly, back in town. Ben Duckett and Jacob Bethell have been the two protagonists in the grainy, Zapruder-style footage from England’s six-day, mid-series jig-about by the sea. True to apparent recent form, both were here for a good time not a long time as England were bowled out for 110 in 29.5 overs. Both batted like men groping for the light switch in the dark against a new ball that seamed the width of the bat at times. But it is also necessary to keep some perspective here, even as this Ashes tour continues its ongoing real-time collapse. The Boxing Day Test was preceded by two significant events. One was the emergence of apparent evidence that didn’t know how to get back to his hotel late one night in the resort town England insisted he visit at 2-0 down in the series. in the bowels of the MCG, a rambling performance that seemed to fall apart even as the words emerged, with a sense by the end of an international sports team being managed by a stack of cardboard boxes with a hat on top, a complex two-month tour planned by the administrative equivalent of a well-meaning jar of marmalade. One of these things is a genuine macro-level failing that must now be called to account. The other, Duckett, Bethell dancing in a club, is shrapnel, fallout, the bits that show in public. But both were related to England’s batting failure here. Key talked this week about “creating an environment” for players such as Bethell to succeed. Oh yeah? With this in mind you wondered here how different an environment designed specifically for him to would look? Blindfold him? Replace his bat with a sourdough baguette? Send him out covered in ants? No rational judge could seriously expect Bethell to succeed here, batting at No 3 on the pitch from hell, having been confined on management orders to three proper red-ball games in the last 12 months. Apart, it seems, from Key, who seemed bullishly convinced Bethell was prepped and ready to go in front of more than 90,000 people at the MCG. Melbourne is a place of festive barbecues right now. This was surely the king of them all. First up was Duckett, star of Lost in Noosa. England’s openers came out to bat in mid-afternoon after the bowling attack had bowled Australia out for 152, very much a case of the party after the after‑party. Scrooge is at the door with a giant turkey. Unfortunately, however, it’s Boxing Day. And Tiny Tim is already dead. There was a vague, omen-based hope Duckett was due a score. His collapse in form has coincided with being told to stop saying things in press conferences about energy and feelings. In the process the magic dust has gone. They’ve shaved Aslan’s mane. Who knows, pressing the unmute button might actually be good for him. There was a pause at the boundary, a look to the heavens, that determined, indomitable stride, the walk of some agreeably feisty woodland creature who wears a waistcoat, drives a car that looks like a shoe and drinks tea out of a thimble. He lasted five balls. The dismissal was odd, a full ball from Mitchell Starc spooned to mid-on in a slow mocking arc. Openers getting out in weird ways often tends to be a sign of something scrambled. It brought Bethell to the crease. He looked good, balanced, confident, collar up, good lines, one of those athletes where even the kit just seems to fit properly. An inside edge got him off the mark. But he was out next over edging Michael Neser behind. England were eight for two and already crumbling again, sustained only by a wild 41 from Harry Brook. But there are still two things worth remembering. First, Duckett didn’t really do much wrong in Noosa. He seemed drunk. He was apparently lost. It’s not a good look. Weak, debauched sports person is the easiest of targets. But it is also just a symptom of the basic slackness of this setup, the lack of guidance, care, boundaries. Why did Duckett not feel under more pressure to avoid this situation? Where was the beefed-up security at this point? Why, come to think of it, did Key choose to take his own break somewhere else entirely? What better, more pressing thing does he have to do on this trip? The same goes for Bethell, who was previously warned in New Zealand, but who is also 22 and being waltzed around the world like a cosseted cabin boy. What is he expected to do with himself in this environment? Dancing with a happy and willing woman: frankly, this page fully endorses this lifestyle choice. Given the world of murk available to young men, any evidence of social skills, leaving your room, the ability to connect agreeably with other humans, well, this is all fine. Bethell’s problems are instead terrible husbandry, the basic weirdness of what he has been asked to do this year. The same goes for Duckett, who was in world-XI form at the end of the Test summer, but who has since played a series of random games, lost his rhythm, and averages 14 in his last 21 innings against white ball, Hundred ball, pink ball and elite Aussie opening attack. Bethell has been more obviously dangled out to dry. It is absurd that looking good in New Zealand last winter should be followed by 34 T20 games and almost zero red ball. This isn’t just a lack of practice. It’s talent-vandalism, a stop on his progress. This Test may now settle down. The MCG was a chilly place at start of play, bruised skies overhead, the outfield a melancholic, mulchy green. The pitch will improve, by most accounts. All of England’s batters have another shot to come. But here there was a sense again of a team sent stumbling into battle by a regime that has confused tearing up the rule book with just not doing your homework.",Barney Ronay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But with the MCG pitch having up to 10mm of grass, Australia have opted to leave Murphy out. Stand-in captain Steve Smith, who returns after experiencing vertigo symptoms, will hold off until the toss on Friday before confirming a XI. It will be the third time in Australia’s last five Tests they have not picked a spinner. Lyon wasn’t selected for the day-night Test in Jamaica in July, and missed out on the second Test of the Ashes series in Brisbane. It is a gamble for an Australian team not to select a spinner in Melbourne, where Lyon and Shane Warne have had success. “A lot of the wickets we’re playing on at present are certainly more seam-friendly than spin-friendly,” Smith said on Thursday. “Last week [in Adelaide] was an anomaly; we saw some rough and we saw Nathan come into play big time. “You’ve just got to play what surface you’re presented with, and this one out here looks like it’s going to offer a fair bit of assistance for the seam bowlers. “If Nathan was here, we’d probably still be having the same conversation as well. “It’s certainly nothing to do with Todd’s skill, we know he’s a quality bowler.” Joining Lyon and captain Pat Cummins on the sidelines is Josh Inglis, with quicks Jhye Richardson, Brendan Doggett and Michael Neser included in the 12-man squad. One of the trio will miss out on playing. Luckless all-rounder Beau Webster was an option to replace the struggling Cameron Green due to his ability to bowl medium pace and spin. But selectors are sticking with Green, who will slide down to bat at No 7 after wicketkeeper Alex Carey’s player-of-the-match 106 and 72 at the Adelaide Oval. Veteran Usman Khawaja, who turned 39 last week, was preferred to Inglis after making 82 and 40 in the third Test in Adelaide. Khawaja will shuffle down to No 5 to accommodate Smith, with Travis Head and Jake Weatherald to continue as the opening pair their opening partnership. Richardson is in contention to play his first Test in more than four years after a luckless run with injury. The 29-year-old has impressed when playing for Australia in all three formats, including three Tests. “He’s just got a great set of skills,” Smith said of the right-arm quick. “When he’s had the opportunity at this level, he’s been outstanding.” After retaining the Ashes in only 11 days, Australia will be seeking to continue by completing a 5-0 whitewash for the first time since 2013-14. Jofra Archer, a rare highlight for England during this series, will miss the Melbourne and Sydney Tests with a side strain. It means Smith and Archer’s fiery confrontation in the final stages of the Gabba Test could be the last time the foes face each other at international level.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/shades-boxing-day-2010-but-australia-2025-bowling-in-control,Brief shades of Boxing Day 2010 but Australia’s 2025 bowling cohort were always in control,2025-12-26T10:18:23.000Z,"Given how parlous England’s batting has been, there was the strong chance that 152 for the home team in Melbourne presaged worse to come. So it turned out. For a while, Boxing Day 2025 felt like a re-enactment of Boxing Day 2010. We’re talking an amateur historical re-enactment, given the lower intensity and higher number of participants with private lives under investigation, but still, the broad shape of the thing was much the same. You had England choosing to bowl on a cloudy morning and finishing off the hosts in time for an early tea. The original instance lasted 42.5 overs, , only 15 deliveries between them. Yet this year’s edition felt different for more reasons than just a higher scoring rate that yielded 152 all out versus 98 all out last time around. In 2010, England owned the day, a ripping out a paralysed middle order, like a légumier preparing string beans. The rehash was a less complete bowling effort that drew a strangely faltering batting response: chop-ons and leg-side nicks and run outs, occasionally the bowling team via Josh Tongue remembering to pitch the ball up before rocketing through someone’s defences. The biggest difference was the scoreline: a fourth Test played at 3-0 rather than 1-1, meaning a series decided rather than one thrumming with life like Frankenstein’s creation on the slab. England’s morning blast (which is not one of their electrolyte drinks) meant that as holders of the Ashes trophy 15 years ago, their bowling destruction left them one good batting innings away from keeping it, and this was a team that had declared on 517 in Brisbane and 620 in Adelaide. That’s why the Boxing Day crowd in 2010 sat in shellshocked silence at the change of innings: the danger of a series loss stared 84,000 attendees in the face. For the current England team, a couple more catches taken or a couple fewer daft shots played in any of Perth, Brisbane or Adelaide might have had them 2-1 down coming to Melbourne, ready to make Australian players and spectators alike nervous at the prospect of levelling up the series with one to play. But they , so this time the record crowd of 94,000 mostly spent the tea break elbowing their way cheerfully to the bar in search of refreshment rather than worrying about the state of the game. With the Ashes secured, an England win here would be a sidebar. In truth, given how parlous England’s batting has been all series, there was the strong chance that 152 for the home team presaged something worse to come for their guests. So it turned out. The heartbreaker for Australia in 2010 wasn’t the 98 all out on day one, it was the 157 without loss that followed it by stumps. That day, the clouds passed, the sun was out, and England’s openers bedded in. This time, the clouds passed, the sun was out, and England’s openers followed suit. Then the middle order. Then the rest. In a single elongated session, they lost the lot inside 30 overs, making the top 10 for England’s fewest deliveries to get bowled out in an Ashes match. Australia simply put it on the spot and waited for the seaming pitch to give an assist. Mitchell Starc began the roll, Michael Neser continued it, Scott Boland all but finished it off, acting as a collective that drew edges behind, nipped balls in toward the stumps, and took catches to finish each other’s work. Jhye Richardson’s comeback match consisted of four containing overs in between watching the show. There will be the usual palaver about whether to castigate a pitch that dared to offer movement, or the modern player for a feckless approach, or coaches for corroded defensive techniques, and nobody will produce a decisive answer. The carnage of 20 fallen wickets with a gap of 46 runs between the teams means that both remain in the match, with the result depending on who can find a way to a score of substance. It still feels emblematic, though, of England’s benighted tour, that even reprising one of their most famous Ashes performances through two furious sessions has still ended up with them the worse off by the end of the day.",Geoff Lemon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/ashes-australia-england-boxing-day-fourth-test-cricket-day-one-report,Australia edge England as 20 wickets fall on wild day one of Boxing Day Test,2025-12-26T10:46:10.000Z,"Bowlers feast on green-tinged pitch on day one at MCG A record 94,199 spectators turned up to the MCG on Boxing Day and none will forget what they witnessed. An extraordinary 20 wickets fell on a pitch offering lavish movement and it left Australia fearing a second multimillion-dollar loss in this Ashes series. The first of these came in Perth, triggered mass refunds and had visiting fans scrambling to book sightseeing trips. This fourth Test always had the ingredients for a repeat, not just a surface with 10mm of grass but also a touring side in England who, and with criticism flying, looked broken before the coin even went up. It actually landed in their favour here, Ben Stokes calling correctly, inserting his opponents without hesitation, and watching Josh Tongue before tea. Tongue was full value for his figures of five for 45, with his natural angle in, fuller length, and wobble seam asking more questions than one of the University Challenge Christmas specials. , there was also a nagging sense that, this time, it was signposting an ordeal for the batters. That ordeal ultimately came to pass in a crazed final session when England fell to 16 for four inside eight overs and, courtesy of Michael Neser’s four for 45, ended up 110 all out in 29.5. All that was left was for Scott Boland to see out six balls before stumps as an auxiliary opener. Fresh from claiming three for 30, he just about survived, prompting a roar from his fellow Victorians as he squirted the last ball of this absurd day for four. Australia closed on four without loss in their second innings, a lead of 46 runs, and everyone could finally breathe. A simple scan down England’s scorecard may prompt an assumption about recklessness; perhaps a few muttered curse words about so-called Bazball. Although the one player who backed their eye and took the aggressive route ended up the top-scorer for either side. All told, Harry Brook’s 41 from 34 balls was a (relative) triumph in challenging circumstances. Brook had walked out at eight for three in the fifth over and danced down the pitch to Mitchell Starc first ball for an almighty yahoo. It met fresh air, admittedly, but Brook was undeterred, crashing two fours and two sixes along the way. His eventual dismissal saw him trying to move across his stumps and clip Boland into the leg side, only to be beaten for a simple lbw. Ridiculous as it sounds, one wonders how many runs England might have mustered had a couple more taken it on. But over the course of this tour a number have started to question themselves and the upshot was an array of gun-shy pokes. For Joe Root, this led to the longest duck of his Test career when he edged Neser behind off the 15th delivery he faced. Neser was exceptional, probing away after a useful 35 with the bat and enjoying the lavish movement on offer; the latest example of why Australian pitches no longer demand express pace. Alex Carey once again spent time up at the stumps, penning England’s batters in their crease and, in the case of Stokes on 16, the result being an edge to Steve Smith at slip. Starc has been the bowler to cause England’s collective meltdown this series and he triggered the cascade of wickets here. In just his second over the left-armer turned Ben Duckett into a pretzel to send a leading edge to mid-on. Not for the first time on tour – albeit occurring during the hours of daylight on this occasion – Duckett looked slightly disorientated. Enter Jacob Bethell, a 22-year-old without a first-class century walking out into the coliseum at No 3. He lasted only five balls before Neser nicked him off, with Zak Crawley then falling in Starc’s next over when a hard-handed push flew into the cordon. Both players looked down suspiciously at the surface, likewise Jamie Smith after being bowled through the gate by Boland. Not since 1901-02 on this ground had 20-plus wickets fallen on the opening day of an Ashes Test match in Australia, albeit that was an era of uncovered pitches. England had Gus Atkinson to thank for ensuring they made it past three figures at least, with his 28 from 35 balls, including three fours and a six, another case for attacking before the inevitable occurred. All of which took attention away from Tongue’s earlier achievement, with his the first Test five-wicket haul for England’s men in Melbourne since Dean Headley back in 1998. Most cherished among the wickets was Steve Smith, bowled for nine to make it four times in four first-class innings he has dismissed the master. Though , Jofra Archer may well ask him how he does it. While in the healthier position at stumps, Australia will have a few regrets about a first innings with only three scores north of 20. As well as a couple of leg-side strangles, there was the sight of Cameron Green running himself out for 17. Brydon Carse was alert here, swooping in off his own bowling and profiting from the all-rounder’s hesitation before throwing down the stumps. The surface may well come under scrutiny from the match referee, Jeff Crowe, but this Boxing Day feast of wickets was not without assistance.",Ali Martin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/that-wicket-is-a-shocker-former-ashes-players-question-state-of-mcg-pitch,‘That wicket is a shocker’: former Ashes players question state of MCG pitch,2025-12-26T12:04:54.000Z,"Both teams bowled out on day one in Melbourne Cook: ‘It’s been too heavily weighted towards the bowlers’ Some of the biggest names in Ashes cricket have attacked the state of the MCG pitch after a record crowd on a Boxing Day blowout in Melbourne. An official crowd of 94,199 broke the attendance record at the country’s biggest sporting venue, eclipsing the 2015 World Cup final and setting a new high-water mark for this historic rivalry. But while they were treated to a flood of nonstop action on a green track that offered frequent and occasionally drastic sideways movement, the sight of both teams being bowled out in less than 76 overs may have been overkill. Not since 1909 had two innings previously been completed on the first day of an Ashes Test. England struck first, blowing the hosts away for 152 to give themselves a chance of saving face in a series that has already slipped through their fingers, but were even less prepared to tackle tricky conditions. Faced with a skilful and relentless Australia attack, they buckled for 110 all out in just 29.5 overs – the smallest total and shortest innings of the fast-fading Bazball era. The average score per wicket was just 13.1, with Harry Brook’s devil-may-care 41 the best from either side. And the verdict from the commentary booths was scathing. “That first-day wicket is a shocker, it really is,” bemoaned Michael Vaughan, England’s 2005 Ashes-winning captain, on Fox Sports. Sir Alastair Cook, who ground out a belligerent 244 on a flat MCG deck in 2017, was in agreement on Test Match Special, adding: “We have to talk a little bit about this wicket. It’s been too heavily weighted towards the bowlers. “They didn’t have to work that hard for wickets. Could both sides have batted better? Yes. But I was watching some of the bowling on that pitch and I was thinking: ‘How do you face that?’ Mitchell Starc was bowling round the wicket, some were nipping miles that way and some nipping miles the other way. I don’t know how you hit it. It’s a bit of an unfair contest.” On SEN Radio, the former England bowler Stuart Broad said: “It has just done far too much. The pitch is doing too much if I’m brutally honest. Test match bowlers don’t need this amount of movement to look threatening.” Even Ricky Ponting was questioning the contest, despite his former side ending the day 46 runs in front with all 10 second-innings wickets intact. “We found out there is 10mm of grass that has been left on this particular surface,” the former Australia captain said on Channel 7. “Last year, which was a Test match that went late into day five, we believe there was only 7mm of grass on that one.” “That will be the question that is going to be asked of the groundsmen – why did you leave more grass this year than previous years?” The result could blow another major hole in Australia’s finances, following a two-day finish in the series opener in Perth. That cost the equivalent of at least £1.5m in ticket sales, with further big hits sustained via lost revenue in the bars and food courts.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/mcg-pitch-josh-tongue-five-fer-england-batting-ashes-boxing-day-test,‘The pitch is doing quite a bit’: Tongue revels in five-fer and defends England batting approach,2025-12-26T08:57:17.000Z,"England all out for 110 but Tongue marks career high Neser swats aside criticism of pitch after 20 wickets fall England may have been bowled out for 110 in Melbourne, another revolution of the unceasing wheel of pain that is the current Ashes tour, but for Josh Tongue day one of the fourth Test was also a career high. “Dreams come true,” Tongue said at the end of a day when 20 wickets fell, five of them to him in Australia’s first innings. “I’ve always wanted to play in the Ashes, if it’s home or away, and this obviously feels very special. Being here at the MCG with all my family in as well makes it even better.” The match situation is already stacked in Australia’s favour, 46 runs ahead on first innings and batting again on an alarmingly sporty pitch that may now settle on day two. But this was also Tongue’s day, star performer with a career best five for 45 as England rolled Australia out for 152. “It’s been an amazing day of Test match cricket on Boxing Day. Obviously coming to the ground here this morning and winning the toss and putting the Aussies in to bat, I thought we did an amazing job as a bowling unit. “And obviously they’ve bowled well as well. It’s a pitch which is doing quite a bit. But we’ve got to just come back tomorrow and do the same again. “I feel like if you put the ball in the right areas, which I felt like we did today as a bowling unit, you’re going to get your rewards. It feels like that fuller length definitely helped, it helped me, definitely, with my angle.” There may be something jarring for English fans in hearing Tongue repeated the playbook chapter headings about putting pressure on their opponents, playing an attractive brand of cricket and so on, something England did here by just about crawling past three figures at 3.7 runs an over. “It’s how we play our cricket. We play a very positive brand of cricket. We try and put pressure on the opposition and take it back to them.” Tongue said there was no real direction on how England would bat on this surface, perhaps inadvisably given they were bowled out in fewer than 30 overs. “There wasn’t really a big chat at all. I feel like we want to put pressure back on to the opposition, so whoever walks out into the middle thinks it’s the right time to obviously shift a gear or put them under pressure. “I think, knowing where your scoring options are is obviously crucial on this sort of wicket when the ball is doing a bit more. But yeah, I thought Brookie batted really well. The runs that he got were obviously crucial in a small first innings total.” Tongue’s spell also contained the latest stage in a run of cross-format success against Steve Smith, but he laughed off suggestions he might “have the wood” over Australia’s captain. “No, he’s obviously an amazing player. I’ve grown up watching him, and obviously getting him out is a very special feeling. But yeah, to me, it’s just another batter that I want to try and get out. It doesn’t really matter who he is. My main goal is to get the batter out at the other end. So yeah, it’s obviously a nice feeling.” There was a more ominous take at close of play from Michael Neser, Australia’s key wicket taker in England’s reply, and a career-long student of the MCG surface. “We know it can move real fast on day one and day two, then when the wicket hardens up and dries out it can be nice to bat on. So I don’t want to have the preconceptions tomorrow that the pitch is going to do a lot. It could be a different story second innings.” Australia will resume on day two with 10 wickets in hand and Travis Head at the crease, alongside surely one of the most popular nightwatchmen in Test history, the local boy Scott Boland. Asked if he felt the green-tinged wicket did too much on day one of a Test, Neser had a concise answer. “I’m a bowler, so no.”",Barney Ronay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/24/australia-mull-over-spin-question-as-todd-murphy-enters-mix-with-plenty-to-play-for,Australia mull over spin question as Todd Murphy enters mix with plenty to play for,2025-12-24T14:00:13.000Z,"Off-spinner not guaranteed spot in XI but may have key role against a side that will try to clear the boundary t would really be something. A Victorian spin bowler – one from St Kilda Cricket Club, no less – to play an Ashes Test in the shadow of the Shane Warne Stand at the MCG. Todd Murphy is not much like Warne in most respects: quiet, modest, thoughtful, bespectacled, a student of the even tempered practice of off-spin bowling rather than the lavish excess of leg-spin. But still. The links that do exist are too appealing to ignore. Not that Murphy is guaranteed to play the fourth Test in place of the injured Nathan Lyon, with Australia’s coach, Andrew McDonald, prevaricating about whether to pick four frontline fast bowlers plus an all-round seamer in Cameron Green or Beau Webster. But in picking him as the lone option in the squad, Australia have already given their spinner more positive feedback than Shoaib Bashir has received from England, who have repeatedly referred to him as their No 1 choice while leaving him on the bench for all four Tests so far. That support could do a lot for Murphy, who excelled on debut in India in 2023, then would probably have been the matchwinner who sent Australia 3-0 up in England had multiple catches not been dropped in the deep while Ben Stokes was looking to take him down at Headingley. England rebounded to 2-2, and whether causative or not, Murphy’s domestic performance tanked before injuries crept in. Despite all this, and left-armer Matt Kuhnemann’s success in Asia, this selection says that Murphy is still seen as Lyon’s principal successor. The recent interest in all-pace bowling attacks, though, is a curious fascination of the current regime. They have gone that way in two of Australia’s last four Tests, Jamaica and Brisbane, but there’s no clarity on whether it was necessary: both were day-night games, easy wins, and only three seamers had much impact in any given innings. The MCG has been more pace friendly in recent years, and selectors may have memories of in two-and-a-half days during the previous Ashes visit, but last year’s match against India topped 400 overs and Lyon bowled nearly 50 of them. This is before you factor in the opposition, a team full of players who find it hard to resist trying to clear boundaries, facing the scrutiny of having already lost the series while batting on the biggest playing surface in the game. Jos Buttler pretty much waved the white flag on his Test career on this ground in 2021 with his early slog to the deep from Lyon. India should have drawn that Test last year until the final session when Rishabh Pant pointlessly tried to launch Travis Head. Spin tempts mistakes, and selecting a team without the option is one in itself. However it pans out, England will be back to facing a more modest attack now that Lyon has had hamstring surgery and Pat Cummins will go back into cotton wool thanks to his recent back problem. The Cummins story is extraordinary, doing months of rehab to come back for a single Test in Adelaide, produce a decisive bowling effort in each innings while captaining the win that clinches the trophy, then deciding that effort was enough. With no Test cricket scheduled until August, the captain could play if needed but will pass up the chance of two more Ashes Tests in favour of caution. The bowling then will be Mitchell Starc, Boland, and if not Murphy, two of Michael Neser, Brendan Doggett, and another comeback-trail candidate in Jhye Richardson. While on paper this should give England an opportunity, in practice they couldn’t win in Perth or Brisbane facing variations of this attack. The condescension that English pundits showed Boland before the series has been returned to them via the windpipe as he bowled 18 overs for 35 runs to do the bricklaying for the Adelaide win, after damaging bursts in the previous two Tests. Australia’s batting, too, will face some shuffling. With McDonald keen to keep wicketkeeper Alex Carey at No 6, and Steve Smith to come back at No 4, Josh Inglis and Usman Khawaja have to scrap for the spot in between them, and the all-rounder’s spot will shuffle down to No 7. That low in the order is more likely to suit the versatile Webster than the wooden starting style of Green, even though selectors would like to give Green a bit more leeway as their long-term project player. This match may be superfluous to deciding the series, as it was in 2021, and 2017, and 2013, and 2006, and 2002, but huge crowds will still roll in throughout every available day. England will have the distant challenge of sorting out scrambled heads and finding the motivation to get past their natural deflation. Whatever the scoreline, though, Australia’s players won’t be short of that. They still have two Ashes Tests to enjoy, and still have plenty riding on who can perform.",Geoff Lemon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/25/fans-end-wait-for-trophy-football-cricket-golf-rory-mcilroy-rugby-union,Better late than never: fans relive watching their teams end a long wait for a trophy,2025-12-25T12:00:40.000Z,"Several teams got their hands on silverware at last in 2025. Here supporters talk about the pain and pleasure of finally winning As a baby boomer, it seemed to me that Cup success was a God-given right. We’d triumphed in 1951, 52 and 55. Wembley was our second home. But it took nearly two decades to return for the FA Cup – in 1974 – for a loss to Liverpool, compounded by the crowing Emlyn Hughes. We lost the 1976 League Cup final against Man City and more than 20 years later experienced yet more Wembley anguish at the hands of Arsenal (1998) and Manchester United (1999). At least the black and white jester’s hat got a couple of outings … was the first I attended with my son, Richard. Maybe that was the omen that our Wembley bogey would end? Nope … but at least I could share the misery with him. Fast forward to 2025 and victory over Liverpool. Euphoric? You bet we were! To paraphrase the famous anthem: “Seventy years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming.” Born in the late 70s, I’d seen my share of false dawns. Both Keegan and Sir Bobby’s thrilling sides were good enough to have at least won a cup, but they’d fallen short. By the time of Mike Ashley’s hope-sapping regime, dreams of glory had turned to dust, and been trodden into the floor of a Sports Direct warehouse. I’d given up on the idea of hugging my dad as we celebrated on the final whistle at Wembley, of seeing a Newcastle captain lifting a trophy, of knowing what victory felt like. We were perennial underachievers. The 2021 takeover – and – changed the script. We finally had ambition, plus the talent to match. And in March we had our moment in the Wembley sun. To be there in the stands with my dad, savouring that victory over Liverpool, meant the world to me. I’ll never forget it. I don’t know how Rory felt on that final day, how he managed to handle it. It shows you how mentally strong he is, to handle that sort of pressure for that long, constantly thinking about it and what he’s about to achieve. Club, Rory’s home town club – where I’m the head professional – there were people watching who were members at the club when he was a kid and they were completely overjoyed for him, knowing what it meant to him and his family. After Rory’s victory, we’ve been inundated with junior memberships, all these kids wanting to be the next Rory and join our junior golf programmes with the hopes that someday it’ll be them. A couple of weeks ago I had a gentleman on the phone who was looking to sign his son up. I explained to him that you can come up and fill in a form, but we’re at capacity at the minute with our junior memberships and that he’ll go on our waiting list. He went: “Oh no, it’s OK. He’s only two at the minute.” We’ve had podcasters and influencers come up to see where he grew up, the fairways he’s walked, and they come into the pro shop and they see his parking space outside and always wonder: “Will he arrive today?” has not only helped Holywood Golf Club but the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s brought golf to another level. He’s box office. We’ve all been here before, 1-0 up against a Manchester heavyweight, within touching distance of a first major trophy. But this time it feels different. There’s no touchline dad-dance when Eberechi Eze meets Daniel Muñoz’s cross on the volley. Ollie Glasner’s team have developed a swagger that falls just the right side of cocky, preserving what makes Palace distinctly Palace while elevating us to more than plucky underdogs. The players understand , and the fans love them for it. Under relentless first-half pressure at Wembley, it’s that connection which drives us. Dean Henderson’s penalty save sparks celebrations almost as wild as those which followed Eze’s goal. We later learn he probably shouldn’t be on the pitch, but no one cares. The second-half onslaught we’re all expecting never materialises. City, for all the riches emerging from their bench, have run out of ideas. Jean-Philippe Mateta, our No 9-cum-cheerleader, calls on us for one last effort as we approach the last 15. The added time is agony – 10 minutes! – but where previous Palace sides would have buckled, I feel disarmingly confident that this time we’ll pull it off. There’s desperation for the final whistle in the stands, but on the pitch the players are calm. When it finally arrives, it’s carnage. I’ve never been surrounded by so many people in tears. Lifetime supporters who never thought they’d see the day. Kids who don’t know just how lucky they are. It’s beautiful. Walking home through Brixton in my Palace shirt and scarf at the end of the night, receiving what feels like a guard of honour from south Londoners who understand what it all means, I realise winning will never feel this good again. As the last few seconds ebbed away, events in the San Mamés stadium seemed to unfold in cinematic slow-motion. Barring some freak mishap – and one of those is never far away when you’re a Spurs fan – I was on the verge of seeing my team lift its first trophy in 17 years, a prestigious European pot to boot. When you’ve invested more than three decades of time, effort and money – for relatively little reward in terms of silverware – it can be hard to believe that you’re about to get what you’ve dreamed of. descended, making it impossible to fully grasp the moment. I put in my noise-cancelling headphones, in the hope that drowning out the crowd would somehow help me process the moment. It didn’t. When the ref finally blew, of course there was wild screaming, hugging of strangers, singing, the sheer joy of watching the players charging about madly in random directions. Yes still, none of it felt real. Perhaps I had squeegeed every last drop of serotonin out of my brain already and there was simply nothing left to create emotions. It was only the next day, after a sleepless night, that it began to sink in, as I watched the fan reaction videos and the replays, of Johnson’s goal, of Van de Ven’s miracle clearance, of the bench when the final whistle went. It was then that the tears came, great sobs of happiness welling up periodically, at breakfast, at the airport, when I saw my kids and my toddler began singing: “We won it in Bilbao.” Things at Spurs but I turn to those moments whenever I need to put a smile on my face. And I’ll be doing that for the rest of my life. PSG are a club that are 55 years old and have won more than 50 trophies. But the long wait for us was around the Champions League; since the Qatari takeover in 2011 that had been the goal, the objective. When we finally won it against Inter, there was a sense of relief. We’ve had some crazy scenarios over the last 10 years in Europe, with everybody laughing at us, like that game . Knowing us, I had doubts until the fourth goal in Munich. It is completely irrational when you think about it because we were so dominant and Inter had almost no chances, but we also had in mind what had happened with Inter and In terms of the emotion among fans in the stands, it seemed to peak around the second and third goals. That’s when people started to realise two things: first, that we’re going to win the game, and secondly, that we were doing something historical in how we were destroying a team in the final. When you look back at it, thank God in 2020, when there were no supporters there because of Covid. To win our first Champions League title in a great stadium with everybody watching on a sunny day made things perfect. I’ve been with Bath since back in the 1960s. My grandfather took me to my first game when I was 14, so I was there long before the halcyon years in the 80s and 90s and now I’ve been there long after them, too. We lost to Saints , when we were down to 14 men, but they’d played better rugby than us all year. This year was different, we’d been top of the league all season. Leicester still ran us close. I think all the commentators assumed Bath were going to walk it, but it was such a nervous occasion. Tigers played really smart rugby and it ended up being one of those games you say “never in doubt” but you don’t really mean it. It was a bit like we’d saved our worst performance till last. My son’s a Tigers fan, and even he agreed we deserved to win it. Next day we had an open-top bus parade and I know some of the people at the club were worried no one would turn up. In the end it felt like the whole city came out for it. Being a fan at the Rec is not always the best experience, I sit in the open stands, and when it’s raining you get wet through, and the rugby’s not always been the best, but the place is still sold out every week. I feel like the title was a reward for all that loyalty the fans have shown over the years. The people I sit with have already booked their tickets for this season’s Champions Cup final in Bilbao next summer, but I’ve not done it yet, I’m too worried I’m going to jinx it. We’d probably never played a match of greater stakes than this World Cup final: home ground, high expectations, an incredible run to the final. So I was on edge, not 100% confident, although I knew we had the ability to perform well. I was also hoping that we’d get a 50-over match in because it was raining quite a bit. I was watching the match with a lot of my friends; we’re part of a group called the Bucket Hat Cult. We’re a loud and proud supporters group of Indian women’s cricket, and all of us had been travelling for the group games, made it for the virtual quarter-final, the semi-final, and we had already bought tickets for the final, even before India made it. And it was 10 hours of singing, dancing, chanting, and eventually crying and celebrating that win. The winning moment was incredible. It was just surreal and fitting that Harmanpreet Kaur, the captain, took that last catch. It’s really hard to describe what this is going to do for women’s cricket in India. That’s a question that everyone is asking. I just hope that the women’s team is not an afterthought anymore. I hope tickets are released on time. That it’s accessible and affordable for fans to go and watch. That the game is promoted well and players are paid well, too. That’s going to be a win for us.",Guardian sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/25/am-i-allowed-to-hold-it-behind-the-seams-of-the-mcgs-shane-warne-exhibition,‘Am I allowed to hold it?’: behind the seams of the MCG’s Shane Warne exhibition,2025-12-25T08:00:34.000Z,"Pivotal items from the legendary leg-spinner’s career, including the ball of the century, make up the exhibit feel like a medieval pilgrim being ushered into a chapel to behold some holy relics,” whispers Tom Holland as we head deeper into the bowels of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The historian and The Rest Is History Podcast co-host, his wife, Sadie, and producer Dom are getting an exclusive look at some of the items that make up the new “Treasures of a Legend” exhibition soon to be unveiled at the Australian Sports Museum inside the famous ground. I’m lucky enough to be tagging along. Jed Smith, the genial manager of the museum, is giving us Pom pioneers the sneak peek. Money can’t buy this access, but a global juggernaut of a podcast seemingly can. The night before Holland and his podcast partner, Dominic Sandbrook, had “played” the Sydney Opera House. They are fresh off the plane to Melbourne with a gig at the Palais Theatre in St Kilda later that evening, a few hundred yards from the very cricket ground where Warne first bamboozled with those fizzing leg-breaks. Holland is a huge cricket fan and bowls devastating medium pace for the Authors CC. His six-hitting and hat-trick-taking have become stuff of myth and legend, with perhaps more emphasis on the former. “Will we get to see ” Holland asks as we excitedly shuffle towards an unmarked green door. Smith pushes the door and holds it open for us to file through. “Oh yes,” he replies with a smile the width of one of Warne’s lurching leggies. We enter a vast room of metal shelving units and huge tables. There are boxes and bags. There are hats, helmets, bats and stumps, boots and balls. So many balls. “There’s a real poignancy to it,” says Smith. “He was actually curating all this stuff as he went. He was a maverick, in the very truest sense of the word, but he was methodical too.” It transpires that Warne would return home after a series and empty his kitbag out, together with Simone, his then wife and mother of his three children. The couple would date, inscribe and catalogue the balls, stumps and other items that he had collected. Year upon year Warne’s achievements and legend grew. More items were chalked up and kept for safekeeping. “It’s almost as if he knew that someday people would want to come and see all this stuff, the objects, now artefacts that underpinned his career and life,” says Smith. There’s his famous white floppy sun hat, the one doffed in the indelible image as he took his final Test bow in 2007. There is the stump from his Trent Bridge balcony boogie in 1997. There is the helmet he donned with a sheepish grin during a 1999 ODI against England as he emerged from the MCG changing rooms in his flip-flops and joggers to quieten a mob throwing golf balls and beer bottles from the notoriously hostile Bay 13 section. Seconds later that same mob were bowing down to Warne en masse. The stand now bears his name. The MCG is the fitting place for the items, a son of Melbourne and proud Victorian. Warne’s family got in touch with the museum and are a key part of the exhibition. “The MCG is the place we all wanted them to end up,” says Smith. “Shane’s children were desperately keen to be involved. They have provided voiceovers that serve as a guide to the exhibition. It gives it real emotion.” Smith guides our slack-jawed group around the room. It says something about Warne’s unique appeal that four English people are rendered childlike and agog upon seeing the totems of the great Australian’s career, especially when you consider Ben Stokes’ men are getting pulverised in the Ashes. Warne always transcended. The items reveal little glimpses into the man. Never buying into the cult of the baggy green, Warne wrote that that the reverence some of his teammates gave the cap made him want to “puke”. It turns out he had four. “Inside one of them it says ‘on loan from There’s umpteen pairs of bowling boots, all with a hole cut out of the big toe area. The pair Warne had on when he took his 249th Test wicket, the one that saw him go past Richie Benaud as Australia’s premier leg-spinner are sat just apart on a shelf. “Beneaud. 249” is scrawled on them in marker pen. Spelling mistake, bowler’s own. We come to the balls. A reverent hush descends. “To have this … it’s just magical,” says Smith as he hands Holland the ball that changed Warne’s life and gave cricket one of its iconic moments. “Am I allowed to it?” Holland asks in disbelief. He cradles it like a newly hatched fledgling. Once-in-a-lifetime photos are hurriedly posed for and taken. The ball comes to me and the cellophane is peeping open. The seam that Warne imbibed with his wizardry is winking up at me. The rest are momentarily distracted. I shouldn’t. I mustn’t. But of course, I do. Like Harvey Keitel in The Piano, bewitched by the hole in Holly Hunter’s tights, I place a gossamer touch on the stitching with my finger end, barely perceptible. I do it for the teenage wrist-spinner in me that has lain dormant for two decades. This could be the cure, like drinking from the grail. I do it for the future grandkids. I do it because Warnie wouldn’t mind, would he? He would have admired the chutzpah, surely? Since returning home from Australia I haven’t yet attempted to bowl a fizzing leg-spinner. I have, however, been racked with guilt. I call Jed Smith and confess. “You scoundrel!” he laughs as he assures me he isn’t going to come after me. “It will firmly be behind security glass in the exhibition,” he adds, pointedly. “Shane Warne’s magic and skill spoke to people on a personal level. I could see how blown away you guys were coming face to face with these objects. It made me even more excited for the exhibition to open.” I smile, with no little relief and we say goodbye. I rub my thumb across my forefinger.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/boxing-day-test-cricket-mcg-festival,Boxing Day Test filled with cheer and hope but nothing can be taken for granted,2025-12-26T02:54:32.000Z,"A record-breaking MCG crowd sets the scene for cricket’s great Ashes celebration with compelling contest on Melbourne green-top he first stop for the self-anointed “Yobbo Crew” when they had arrived at cricket’s mecca was the statue of Shane Warne. The group – just one of hundreds who had dressed up for the big day at the MCG – wore thongs, mustard yellow bucket hats brandishing their name, and denim shorts with less leg coverage than a 7-2 field. As the clock ticked past 9am, they appeared happy to be at Australian cricket’s great festival, but looked less than comfortable with the temperature. After the coldest Christmas in Melbourne in two decades, . And so, before taking their photo under the bronzed leg-spinner, the Yobbo Crew took off their hoodies to reveal matching yellow singlets, and offered a zinced grimace. Another fan, talking to his companion while walking down from Jolimont Station, put it succinctly, “It’s fucking freezing,” as his friend remarked how different it was compared with 2024. It wasn’t just about the weather. Last year the cricketing contest between Australia and India held a nation transfixed, as the Border-Gavaskar trophy remained alive right through to the final Test. The MCG fixture, when it was close to 40C as At stumps on Boxing Day last year, the notion that within 12 months Australia would have won the Ashes but Konstas would already be out of the team was unimaginable. But few things can be taken for granted, as the police patrolling the ground with assault rifles reminded all. Five overs in and the sun finally broke through, as England looked to find a counter to Australia’s generally competent cricket, AKA “Ronball”. There was an early test for Snicko, prompting more snickering from fans around the ground, then a surprise. The wicket of Travis Head brought a hearty cheer from the Barmy Army, and three more breakthroughs had English fans wondering whether this was to be their first Test victory on Australia soil in almost 15 years. The morning’s festivities, with a full stadium enjoying a compelling contest on a pitch tinged with green, was a sight to behold. Although comments from Australia (CA) chief executive, Todd Greenberg, before play outside the ground, suggested it should not be taken for granted. since it was established in the 1980s, but CA’s new boss – overseeing the national pastime on Boxing Day for the first time – said a pink-ball Test match the day after Christmas was “not off the cards”. “We’ve been talking a lot about the strength of pink-ball cricket. It was amazing this year in Brisbane, it has been really good in Adelaide,” he said. “March 2027, we’ll get an opportunity here in Melbourne.” Greenberg was talking about the one-off 150th anniversary match between these sides. Despite that event’s nod to the past, it now represents a pilot for the evening timeslot loved by broadcasters. Stuart Fox, chief executive of the Melbourne Cricket Club, offered the counter argument. “I actually love the tradition personally,” he said. “I love the tradition of a day game here, and I think the day-night Tests have been great in Adelaide and Brisbane.” Fox had expressed disappointment earlier in the week that the outcome of the , but was still hopeful of a ground record single day Test attendance, beating the 91,112 set in 2013. “It’ll be a record today,” he said on Friday morning. His confidence was justified when the figure of 93,442 was announced just before 3pm. It is not only a Test match record, it eclipses the 93,013 that attended the World Cup final in 2015 to make it MCG’s biggest ever cricket crowd. While AFL grand finals attract more than 100,000, cricket attendances at the MCG are capped due to the seats lost at either end. “I’ve been trying to see if Todd could remove some of the sight screens and reduce them because then we could get a few more seats in the stadium,” Fox said lightheardly. “The players, I don’t think they quite agree with my thoughts.” The pursuit of growth is the reason for a mooted rebuild of the Shane Warne Stand, which was constructed in the 1990s. A business case is currently being prepared, and a capacity increase is on the table to return the MCG to the top 10 list of the world’s biggest stadiums. “You go to India, as one example, people know the MCG before they know the Sydney Harbour Bridge,” said Victorian sport minister, Steve Dimopoulos. “We want to make sure that it stays an iconic venue for the next 50 years.” Outside the ground, there was a mob of inflatable kangaroo outfits, and a horde of men wearing viking helmets adorned with golden pigtails. A family of four from Queensland had come down for the first two days, their outfits matching in lemon yellow and a mosaic of cockatoos. Tomorrow’s were to have pineapples, according to the mother’s plan, although the son had outgrown his and would wear his Australian jersey. Nearby, a middle-aged Indian husband and wife took off their puffer jackets for a picture under the Boxing Day Test sign. It was an English couple, about the same age, they approached to take the snap. Afterwards, the Englishman asked shyly, “Would you mind doing one of us?”, just as the group was set to part. Another Englishman, Rob Goliah, arrived in lycra at the ground before play. He had ridden his bicycle from Melbourne in Derbyshire, across 22 countries, to its Victorian namesake to raise money for medical research. His cross-border journey was celebrated with the international language of a “shoey”. His was the first of many Boxing Day beers to find the floor.",Jack Snape,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/25/ashes-cricket-daughter-child-summer-australia,My five-year-old daughter is learning to love cricket. It’s a source of delight in a difficult summer,2025-12-25T19:00:48.000Z,"Watching the Ashes has felt like a small bright spot. Something for Australians to cheer about when our hearts are broken One of the many joys of this Ashes series is that this summer my daughter has begun to care about cricket. And there is nothing that reminds you of the beautiful weirdness of the game so much as trying to explain it to a relentlessly curious five-year-old. First there’s the language of cricket, which frankly bears no resemblance to language we use in the rest of our lives. We’ve resorted to calling “overs” “turns”, “runs” “points” and “bowling” “throws” to help her understand what we’re talking about. There are the obvious explanatory challenges presented by the rules – watching my husband try to explain lbw (leg before wicket) was a sight to behold – and then there’s just the variability of the game. “How long does it go for?” she asks. “Five days, but it could be four, or three,” we tell her. Or – as was the case for the first men’s Ashes Test this year, when we promised her it would still be on the next day when she woke up, and then Travis Head obliterated England’s bowling attack – two. “But who is winning?” she has asked more times than I can count over the past month. “Well, it doesn’t really work like that,” we say. What sort of sport is this? Cricket is also a drama of personalities and her observations of the human element of the game have demonstrated a child’s delightful clear-eyed perceptiveness. “Why is he so grumpy?” she asked when the camera kept cutting – with a regularity that bordered on cruelty – to Nathan Lyon as 12th man during the Test at the Gabba. Then, when his return to the side in the third Test was cut short by that furious dive in the outfield, she was alert to my strong reaction. “What did he do wrong? What’s a ‘numpty’? Why is he too old to do things like that? How old is he?” My favourite of her reactions was when Ben Stokes was hit in the groin by a scorching delivery from Michael Neser. She was perplexed by the response, both from her parents and the commentators who couldn’t stop laughing. “Why do they keep showing it and laughing if it hurts him?” Bless her. Also, alert to injustice in the way that children often are, she observed one day: “There are no women talking.” We jumped in to tell her there is the excellent Alison Mitchell but she’s right. Like Paw Patrol with its six heroic dog characters, only one of whom is female – also a source of outrage in her life – this is not an acceptable gender mix. I am under no illusions that a key part of the appeal for her is that cricket is television, hours and hours of television that is permitted by her parents, who normally keep screen time reasonably rationed. Television on while we’re at the dinner table? Never. During the evening session of the pink ball Test? Absolutely. The weirdness of cricket, which I am seeing afresh this season through her eyes, has made me deeply grateful to my parents (and brother and grandad) for indoctrinating me into the sport as a child. I don’t profess to be a cricket expert – as I’m sure this article will attest – but I know enough to enjoy it. It’s a sport with a high bar of entry. I’m sure you can pick up “enjoying cricket” as an adult but, as with learning how to swim, or speak Mandarin, it’s much easier as a kid. Maybe it is because of this that I have loved watching my daughter’s nascent love of the game – the moment she squealed with delight when she watched a batsman hit a cracking four and yelled to us “He did something good! The referee [sic] went like this!” and waved her arm horizontally in front of her. I love, too, the way that cricket can be a salve in an otherwise hard time. This summer, already scarred by violence and tragedy just a few weeks in, cricket has felt for me, I think probably for many, like a small bright spot. A flicker of normality in the dark fortnight we have all just lived through. A – respectfully – ultimately unimportant contest that has allowed us to have something to cheer about or just quietly follow, at a time our hearts are broken. I wonder if this has been part of the appeal for her, too, perceptive as she is. This summer hasn’t had an easy start for my little family. Apart from the cataclysm of the , which would be more than enough in itself, we have been dealing with the death of someone very close to us. Cricket hasn’t fixed anything, or balanced the scales in any way. I don’t want to overstate things. But it has given us something to cheer for, something to distract and delight us and – given we are not England supporters – something to care about that doesn’t break our hearts.",Kate Lyons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/24/womens-cricket-team-of-the-year-from-jemimah-rodrigues-to-alana-king,Women’s cricket team of the year: from Jemimah Rodrigues to Alana King,2025-12-24T11:00:09.000Z,"The Spin’s annual selection marks a history-making World Cup triumph for India, and work to do for England ndia’s mission to build a global women’s cricket dynasty advanced apace in 2025. Few will forget the sight of Harmanpreet Kaur’s team converging joyously on the field at the DY Patil Stadium to celebrate a fairytale that was five decades in the making. That final was the highlight of a year that included only one Test match – the at the end of January. As ever, therefore, the Spin’s team of the year is cross-format, though we gave substantial weight to performances at crunch moments in the aforementioned World Cup. And if anyone is wondering why there are only two England players in this team, you must have forgotten how 2025 started. Fair enough – most English fans are still trying to forget it, too. Top of Nat Sciver-Brunt and co’s Santa wishlist is a brighter year ahead. In June, Mandhana’s teammates berated her for having never scored a Twenty20 hundred. “You are not doing justice to your talent,” Radha Yadav told her. Smriti’s response, three days later at Trent Bridge, was to nail down the in 51 balls. She celebrated by pointing up at Radha on the balcony. It was all presumably a bit tongue-in-cheek, given that Smriti was enjoying the most prolific year of any female cricketer in history. She scored 1,362 ODI runs in 2025 – the previous record was Belinda Clark’s 970 from 1997 – and now has 17 international hundreds across all formats, more than anyone bar Meg Lanning. RCB recently retained her for the 2026 Women’s Premier League for 3.5 crore – the maximum price, but still somehow a bargain when it buys you the services of a player this classy. During South Africa’s recent T20 against Ireland, an awestruck fan was interviewed after watching Wolvaardt strike her fourth international century of the year. “She’s Miss 360,” he said. “That’s the best hundred I’ve seen at Newlands.” For the second year in succession, Wolvaardt captains the Spin’s XI, and for good reason. If everyone could have played like Wolvaardt, South Africa would have won a World Cup this year. First, she had to pick up her team from the doldrums of and convince them they were potential tournament winners. Then she batted her heart out with in the semi-final and final. It wasn’t to be this time, but on the day it does happen you can bet that Wolvaardt (and her cover drive) will be at the heart of the action. Rodrigues bookended 2025 with two hundreds – against Ireland in January and Australia in October – but the real story is what happened in between. She had to battle the uncertainty of the selectors – she was dropped midway through the World Cup – and her own crippling self-doubt. All the more remarkable, then, that she managed to play one of the in the tournament semi-final, shepherding an exhausting run chase against the defending champions while reciting psalms to herself between overs. Three days later, India won a World Cup final – but it was Rodrigues who landed the killer blow. A day after Jon Lewis sidestepped questions about the unfit nature of his team and pontificated about the nice weather in Bondi, a ruddy-cheeked, sweaty Mooney showed him exactly what the difference was between the two teams. First, she scored an in the Adelaide T20 – mostly in sprinted singles. Then she kept wicket, seamlessly stepping in for a creaking Alyssa Healy (as she did numerous times across the year). Mooney’s eventual series run tally was a phenomenal 409. What did you do in those heady newborn days, when life was a haze of nappy changes, milky feeds and snatched bursts of sleep? Sciver-Brunt decided that she would take on one of the hardest jobs in cricket: . As well as attempting to pick up the pieces of the Ashes debacle, she somehow also continued to be England’s best batter, bailing them out of trouble more than once during the World Cup as they staggered through to the knockout phase. At the start of 2025, Gardner hadn’t struck a hundred in 175 internationals for Australia. Batting at No 6, her task had generally been big-hitting cameos, after those above her scored the bulk of the runs. Over the past 12 months, though, Australia’s top order floundered enough times that Gardner had to find a different role: she still smashes sixes, but she bats long, too. Twice in the World Cup, against New Zealand and , she dug her side out of a substantial hole, scoring crucial hundreds which turned wobbles into winning situations. She has maintained her ICC No 1 all-rounder ranking, finishing the year with 19 wickets – and if you haven’t watched her “mayo on it” juggle-parry catch at Hobart, : you’re in for a treat. Sometimes the cricketing gods write a fitting ending to a World Cup. So it was in 2025, when the last South Africa wicket to fall in the final was claimed by thetournament MVP and leading wicket-taker (22 scalps), Sharma. India’s death-overs hero also stepped up her batting a notch this year, scoring three half-centuries in the World Cup – including a crucial one in the final – and considerably upping her strike-rate. In the year’s single Test at the G, Sutherland’s 163 runs earned her the player of the match award. During the World Cup, her main contribution was with ball in hand, taking 17 wickets and dazzling opponents with her variations. England are struggling with a dearth of all-rounders; meanwhile, Australia possess two of the world’s best: Sutherland is currently locked in a battle with her teammate Gardner over who should be considered the world’s leading jill-of-all-trades. File that one under “nice problem to have”. It hasn’t been the easiest of years for Ecclestone. During the Ashes she was thrust into the limelight when Alex Hartley revealed Ecclestone had refused to do a pre-match interview with her former teammate. The social media backlash was so intense that Ecclestone considered quitting cricket altogether. She had to sit out the early English summer due to a dual battle with physical injury and mental health. And yet when she was bowling, all of that baggage fell away, as the wickets continued to fall: 42 of them for England in 2025, including 16 in the World Cup. The key for those around her is to make sure she continues to enjoy her cricket – which might mean staying away from social media the next time something goes wrong. King started the year tormenting England in the Women’s Ashes and ended it by unleashing one of the best spells of bowling ever seen in a World Cup, finishing with . The 30-year-old leg-spinner has honed her craft over many years, and now at last has mastery of the trickiest art in the game: Australia continue to reap the rewards. Akter hasn’t had the opportunities that others have had – she played just 14 ODIs in 2025, and no T20 Internationals – but this was a breakthrough year for the 20-year-old fast bowler. She was the poster girl of Bangladesh’s World Cup campaign, during which they beat Pakistan and almost toppled the heavyweights of England and South Africa. Her hooping in-swing has to be seen to be believed – – but now she’s showcased it on the global stage, let’s hope some franchise gigs might be in the pipeline.",Raf Nicholson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some had just given birth and others were still in labour. Working at the hospital that night, lab technician Abdo-Rabo Ahmed, 28, was one of the few known survivors. “I heard the voices of women and children screaming,” he says. “They were killing everybody inside the hospital. Those of us who were able to run, did.” In one of the most horrifying incidents of the north African country’s two-year civil war, armed soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been fighting the Sudanese army, stormed the hospital, more than 460 patients and their companions. It was “an unspeakable atrocity”, say rights groups, and one of the worst recent examples of the collapse in protection for the hundreds of millions of civilians trapped in areas of conflict in Ukraine, Gaza, , the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan. All major powers are signatories to the , which commit them to protecting civilians from warring parties, yet in the past year there has been a on healthcare systems. Women going through childbirth are particularly vulnerable due to their need to access locally available services. A Guardian investigation and data collected by the NGO reveal an unprecedented level of violence: nearly 300 attacks on and disruptions to maternity care facilities, staff and pregnant women over the past three years and at least 119 incidents involving direct strikes on hospitals and delivery wards. Most of these attacks have taken place in , Gaza and Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of pregnant women are trapped in war zones. Women have been killed, prevented from accessing care or forced to give birth in unsafe conditions. The data also shows at least 68 midwives, obstetricians and gynaecologists have been killed, 15 kidnapped and 101 arrested – sometimes while assisting births. The figures are likely to be an underestimate as they only include incidents that have been reported in local, national and international news outlets and online databases. In some conflict areas, communications and information are sparse. Last year, it was reported that . Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women, says: “These are not natural consequences of war. They constitute a pattern of reproductive violence.” As well as killing women and skilled staff, the attacks are destroying maternal and neonatal care facilities and posing a threat to countries’ ability to repopulate. In Gaza, a UN commission has cited the impact on the right to reproductive health as one of the reasons for Even after the October ceasefire, doctors in Gaza say women and children continue to die from inadequate care, due to shortages of medicine and equipment. A UN agency official has said he received reports of women in Gaza beside roads because they could not access a hospital. “We’ve had rockets and shells fired directly at the wards, operating rooms and maternity wards,” says Dr Adnan Radi, head of the gynecology and obstetrics departments at al-Awda hospital. A spokesperson for the Israeli military says it does not deliberately target maternity care facilities and does not seek to affect the birthrate of Gaza’s civilian population. where births have been forced underground and stress has caused birth complications. In the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, the maternity hospital has been damaged five times since the start of the war. “Russia is targeting us deliberately,” the head of obstetrics, Petro Marenkovskyi says. Russia has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Olga Butenko, medical director at a perinatal centre in the north-eastern city of Sumy, says: “The reality is that every facility can be under attack now. Air defence tries to protect critical infrastructure, but if the Shahed [drone] is shot down, the debris may fall on a hospital.” within 50km (31 miles) of a deadly conflict there are few safeguards, or war crimes prosecutions for those targeting maternity care. The lack of accountability has created a “culture of impunity”, says Payal Shah, a human rights lawyer at the NGO Physicians for Human Rights. “Attacks on reproductive healthcare, like forced pregnancy and forced sterilisation, can be understood as acts of genocide by preventing births or destroying the survival of a group.” long before the attack on the Saudi maternity hospital, according to the World Health Organization, which says malnutrition is rising sharply, especially among children and pregnant women. In the DRC, data on attacks has been coming out of rebel-occupied areas and unreliable access to the internet. But shelling in the city of Goma in January hit the neonatal ward at Charity maternity hospital, , many of them women and children. In Myanmar, medical facilities have been bombed and dozens of midwives and patients have been arrested, killed or injured over the past two years Most maternal deaths are preventable using routine measures, say medical experts, but health systems can collapse during war, dismantling the conditions that make safe childbirth possible. Rights groups say fear is also driving women away from facilities once considered safe, forcing them to take risks, such as giving birth at home without skilled assistance or access to emergency care. “If maternity hospitals are being deliberately targeted then it speaks to a wider and more disturbing trend: the use of violence against hospitals as a weapon to spread fear and to tear apart the social fabric that holds communities together,” says Maarten Van Der Heijden, a lawyer and researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “There is no absolute protection for hospitals in war. Under the Geneva conventions, medical facilities can lose their safeguarded status if used for acts deemed ‘harmful to the enemy’, which has now become a standard defence.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

As the year ended, teams of specialists were of an unknown illness in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, now thought to be cases of severe malaria and other diseases Maria van Kerkhove, interim director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the World Health Organization (WHO), is concerned about – the virus is not spreading human to human but there have been an increasing number of human infections in the past year. While there is a well-established international monitoring system specifically focused on influenza, surveillance in sectors such as trade and agriculture, where humans and animals mix, is not comprehensive enough, she says. And she stresses that the ability to properly assess the risk “depends on the detection, the sequencing, the transparency of countries to share those samples”. The Covid-19 pandemic left health systems worldwide “really shaky” and has been followed by a long list of other health crises, she says. “Seasonal influenza started circulating, we had an mpox emergency, we’ve had , we’ve had cholera, we’ve had earthquakes, we’ve had floods, measles, diphtheria, dengue, . Health systems are really buckling under the weight and our health workforce globally has really taken a beating. Many have left. Many are suffering from PTSD. Many died.” What keeps her up at night, she says, is “complacency”, worrying that the response to a new threat will be hampered by “the notion that ‘it’ll just go away’, or ‘it’ll burn itself out’”. The world has never been in a better position when it comes to the expertise, technology and data systems to rapidly detect a threat, Van Kerkhove says. The expansion of genomic sequencing abilities to most countries worldwide, and better access to medical oxygen and infection prevention and control, remain “really big gains” after the Covid-19 pandemic, she adds. It means her answer to whether the world is ready for the next pandemic “is both yes and no”. “On the other hand, I think the difficulties and the trauma that we’ve all gone through with Covid and with other outbreaks, in the context of war and climate change and economic crises and politics, we are absolutely not ready to handle another pandemic,” she says. “The world doesn’t want to hear me on television saying that the next crisis is upon us.” The world of public health is “fighting for political attention, for fiscal space, for investment” – rather than nations working to stay in “a steady state of readiness”, she says. The long-term solution, she says, is “about getting that level of investment right. It’s about getting that sense of urgency correct. It’s about making sure that the system isn’t fragile.” Rwanda’s minister of health, Dr Sabin Nsanzimana, found himself dealing with two major disease outbreaks in 2024: Africa’s mpox public health emergency, and of Marburg virus in his own country. He also co-chairs the governing board of the , set up in November 2022 as a financing mechanism to help poorer countries prepare for emerging pandemic threats. If the next pandemic arrives in 2025, he warns: “Sadly, no, the world is not ready. Since the Covid public health emergency ended last year, too many political leaders have turned their attention and resources toward other challenges. We are entering once again what we call the cycle of neglect. People are forgetting just how costly the pandemic was to human lives and to economies and are failing to heed its lessons.” He says the Pandemic Fund “urgently needs more resources to fulfil its mission” – it has received requests from low- and middle-income countries totalling $7bn (£5.6bn) to fund pandemic preparation and response investments, against $850m available. In 2022 the WHO began negotiations for a new pandemic accord that would provide a firm basis for future international cooperation. But talks failed to yield a result by an initial deadline of the annual World Health Assembly in May 2024. Negotiators are now aiming for a deadline of So far the talks have actually worsened trust levels between countries, says Dr Clare Wenham of the department of health policy at LSE. There is no agreement on what Wenham calls “the big elephant in the room” of “pathogen access and benefit sharing” – essentially, what guarantees poorer countries are given that they will have access to treatments and vaccines against a future pandemic disease, in exchange for providing samples and data that allow those therapies to be created. suggests more equal vaccine access during the Covid-19 pandemic could have saved more than a million lives. “[Governments] are just so far apart, and no one is really willing to budge,” says Wenham, with only 10 days of actual negotiating time scheduled before the World Health Assembly deadline. Practical questions remain about the feasibility of what is being proposed, she adds, “even if you get over the fundamentals of how unwilling governments are to compromise”. Her assessment is blunt: “We’ve had the biggest pandemic of our lifetimes, and we’re worse prepared than we were when we went in.” She is among commentators who fear that any accord pushed through in May will lack real teeth, agreeing only a top-level framework, with trickier detailed decisions delayed. But those involved in the process have rebutted that idea.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/20/ai-generated-poverty-porn-fake-images-being-used-by-aid-agencies,AI-generated ‘poverty porn’ fake images being used by aid agencies,2025-10-20T06:00:36.000Z,"Exclusive: Pictures depicting the most vulnerable and poorest people are being used in social media campaigns in the sector, driven by concerns over consent and cost AI-generated images of extreme poverty, children and sexual violence survivors are flooding stock photo sites and increasingly being used by leading health NGOs, according to global health professionals who have voiced concern over a new era of “poverty porn”. “All over the place, people are using it,” said Noah Arnold, who works at Fairpicture, a Swiss-based organisation focused on promoting ethical imagery in global development. “Some are actively using AI imagery, and others, we know that they’re experimenting at least.” at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp studying the production of global health images, said: “The images replicate the visual grammar of poverty – children with empty plates, cracked earth, stereotypical visuals.” Alenichev has collected more than 100 AI-generated images of extreme poverty used by individuals or NGOs as part of social media campaigns against hunger or sexual violence. Images he shared with the Guardian show exaggerated, stereotype-perpetuating scenes: children huddled together in muddy water; an African girl in a wedding dress with a tear staining her cheek. In a in the Lancet Global Health, he argues these images amount to “poverty porn 2.0”. While it is hard to quantify the prevalence of the AI-generated images, Alenichev and others say their use is on the rise, driven by concerns over consent and cost. Arnold said that US funding cuts to NGO budgets had made matters worse. “It is quite clear that various organisations are starting to consider synthetic images instead of real photography, because it’s cheap and you don’t need to bother with consent and everything,” said Alenichev. AI-generated images of extreme poverty now appear in their dozens on popular stock photo sites, including , in response to queries such as “poverty”. Many bear captions such as “Photorealistic kid in refugee camp”; “Asian children swim in a river full of waste”; and “Caucasian white volunteer provides medical consultation to young black children in African village”. Adobe sells licences to the last two photos in that list for about £60. “They are so racialised. They should never even let those be published because it’s like the worst stereotypes about Africa, or India, or you name it,” said Alenichev. Joaquín Abela, CEO of Freepik, said the responsibility for using such extreme images lay with media consumers, and not with platforms such as his. The AI stock photos, he said, are generated by the platform’s global community of users, who can receive a licensing fee when Freepik’s customers choose to buy their images. Freepik had attempted to curb biases it had found in other parts of its photo library, he said, by “injecting diversity” and trying to ensure gender balance into the photos of lawyers and CEOs hosted on the site. But, he said, there was only so much his platform could do. “It’s like trying to dry the ocean. We make an effort, but in reality, if customers worldwide want images a certain way, there is absolutely nothing that anyone can do.” In the past, leading charities have used AI-generated images as part of their communications strategies on global health. In 2023, the Dutch arm of UK charity Plan International released a containing AI-generated images of a girl with a black eye, an older man and a pregnant teenager. on YouTube with AI-generated “re-enactments” of sexual violence in conflict, which included AI-generated testimony from a Burundian woman describing being raped by three men and left to die in 1993 during the country’s civil war. The video was removed after the Guardian contacted the UN for comment. A UN Peacekeeping spokesperson said: “The video in question, which was produced over a year ago using a fast-evolving tool, has been taken down, as we believed it shows improper use of AI, and may pose risks regarding information integrity, blending real footage and near-real artificially generated content. “The United Nations remains steadfast in its commitment to support victims of conflict-related sexual violence, including through innovation and creative advocacy.” Arnold said the rising use of these AI images comes after years of debate in the sector around ethical imagery and dignified storytelling about poverty and violence. “Supposedly, it’s easier to take ready-made AI visuals that come without consent, because it’s not real people.” Kate Kardol, an NGO communications consultant, said the images frightened her, and recalled earlier debates about the use of “poverty porn” in the sector. “It saddens me that the fight for more ethical representation of people experiencing poverty now extends to the unreal,” she said. Generative AI tools have long been found to replicate – and at times exaggerate – . The proliferation of biased images in global health communications may make the problem worse, said Alenichev, because the images could filter out into the wider internet and be used to train the next generation of AI models, a process which has been A spokesperson for Plan International said the NGO had, as of this year: “adopted guidance advising against using AI to depict individual children”, and said the 2023 campaign had used AI-generated imagery to safeguard “the privacy and dignity of real girls”.",Aisha Down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/10/bangladesh-myanamar-rohingya-refugees-traffickers-malaysia,‘A generation lost at sea’: the desperate Rohingya falling prey to traffickers as they flee Bangladesh,2025-12-10T12:00:02.000Z,"Barred from work and school in Bangladesh, thousands of refugees are making the perilous voyage to Malaysia by boat – with some beaten en route to extort even more money ajuma Begum stayed awake until 3am waiting for her son to return from the market before accepting he was not coming home. The next day he phoned to say he was on the Bangladeshi coast, waiting to begin a boat journey to Malaysia that she had desperately tried to stop him taking. It was the start of weeks of worry for the 58-year-old, whose fears deepened when a boat carrying Rohingya refugees capsized near in early November, killing dozens. She felt as though she could finally breathe again when he finally reached his destination. Begum’s 16-year-old son, Abu Musa, is among thousands from the persecuted Myanmar ethnic minority to have boarded boats in the past two months, according to the , a human rights organisation based in the region that tracks Rohingya boat journeys. They are trying to escape the refugee camps in Bangladesh, where despair has set in after aid cuts led to , or from Myanmar, where the Muslim minority have faced decades of violence and persecution. The Guardian has spoken to refugees who have arrived in Malaysia and to the families of those who left. Among them are young men who fled the deteriorating conditions in the refugee camps and women sent to marry men or to reunite with husbands already in Malaysia. live in Bangladesh’s camps near the Myanmar border; three-quarters of them arriving in 2017 after Rohingya people by the Myanmar military. Conditions in Bangladesh are difficult, as the government has imposed strict limits on the refugees’ ability to work or move freely. There is also little access to education in the overcrowded camps, which have seen another The newer arrivals have fled conflict between the country’s military and the rebel Arakan Army, who are , in Rakhine state, the northern region of Myanmar that was home to most of the Rohingya. The Arakan Project, which has monitored the persecution of Rohingya in since 1999, says it has documented 22 boats leaving the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia since September, carrying a total of about 4,000 people. The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, says at sea this year, either travelling between Myanmar and Bangladesh or on longer journeys across south-east Asia. Many Rohingya are enticed by people traffickers with the promise of better lives away from Bangladesh. But the migrants can be kidnapped and held for ransom at various points along the route. Chris Lewa, coordinator of the Arakan Project, says it is hard to know the exact numbers of people who have left. are held in secret locations – in warehouses, forests or along the coast – then ferried out on small boats to a larger ship at sea where hundreds are held. The traffickers then demand money from the migrants’ families. “If they delay, then they are beaten. Often they beat them on camera, so the family in Bangladesh can see it,” she says. “I have testimony from families saying their daughters or wives are being beaten, sometimes their legs being put in wooden stocks – horrible things.” Abu Musa left Bangladesh because he felt that Bangladesh’s restrictions on refugees working or going to school left him without a future. “My mother didn’t want me to leave the camp and she was watching me all the time. Then one day I left our shelter, telling her that I’m going to market but I went straight to Teknaf [on the coast] with my friends,” he says. It took 26 days for Musa and his friends to reach Malaysia, on a route that involved two weeks at sea and being held in trafficking camps in Myanmar and Thailand along the way. Towards the end, they went at least six days without food. “When I ask about his journey, he just cries and he doesn’t say anything,” says his mother. Lewa believes levels of migration between the Bay of Bengal and south-east Asia could be comparable with its peak in 2015, when about , according to Human Rights Watch. The discovery of mass graves in Thailand in May 2015 led to a crackdown on trafficking networks. But now it appears they are growing again. Lewa believes aid cuts in Bangladesh and violence in Myanmar are fuelling the desperation that propels high numbers of Rohingya to the traffickers. A Rohingya broker, who has recruited for the traffickers since 2018, says so many people want to go that she no longer has to seek them out as they now come to her. Myanmar criminals pay her 20,000 Bangladeshi taka (£122) for each person she recruits. Those people themselves have to pay about 500,000 taka – with the traffickers then able to extort further amounts from them through ransom demands. “There is no limit to how many people can go,” she says. “The traffickers can take people from many places; some boats can take 400 people.” Like Musa, 13-year-old Furkahan went missing from his family’s shelter in late October. “We looked everywhere – in the shelters of our relatives, of our friends, his school, in every place he used to go – but we could not find him anywhere,” says the boy’s father, Abdul Hoque, 35. The family were distraught. Since leaving Myanmar in 2017, Hoque had spent all of the money he had on private tuition for his son offered by other refugees in lieu of formal schooling. After two days of searching, they received a call from a trafficker in Teknaf saying the boy was “on the way” to Malaysia and demanding 350,000 taka for his “safe arrival”. The boat departed on 29 October and there has still been no news. They fear he could have been on a boat that sunk near the border between Malaysia and Thailand on 9 November, carrying about 70 Rohingya. His mother, Rashida, 30, says: “We cannot sleep or eat. We only pray to hear something, anything, about our son.” According to Lewa, 36 bodies have been recovered by Thai and Malaysian authorities, with 26 people rescued; eight remain missing. The boat’s passengers had been on a larger boat holding about 300 people but had disembarked on to smaller boats to land on the Malaysian coast. Malaysia’s human rights commission said last month that it was by the country’s decision to charge 11 of the shipwreck’s survivors for entering without valid documentation. The family of 24-year-old Robina Bibi were distraught to learn that she and her five-year-old son had died in the tragedy. Bibi was scared but persuaded to travel by her husband, who had already reached Malaysia. The family say they last spoke to her when she left on 26 October but had repeatedly called traffickers, who insisted she would reach Malaysia safely until finally admitting she had drowned when the boat capsized. The trafficker no longer accepts their calls. Robina Bibi’s father, Abul Baser, says his wife was already unwell and but has gone into a coma-like state from the shock of the news. “I have lost my daughter and that means I lost my world. The world has become a dark place for me,” he says. “She feared the water a lot and she didn’t need to go there but she was bullied to go there.” He blames Rohingya deaths at sea on a lack of international action to allow the refugees to return home safely to Myanmar. “If the world doesn’t take any step nowadays, the whole Rohingya generation will be lost in the sea and in the jungle,” he says.",Kaamil Ahmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/07/brazil-amazon-kawahiva-uncontacted-indigenous-reserve-funai-loggers-ranchers,The loggers and ranchers are closing in but still Brazil’s Kawahiva people wait for protection,2025-12-07T06:00:13.000Z,"Bureaucratic delays and funding shortages stall plans to carve out a forest reserve for the uncontacted Indigenous group on the southern fringe of the Brazilian Amazon n 2024, agents of the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples ( ) walked more than 60 miles through rainforest on the southern fringe of the Brazilian Amazon on a mission to monitor and help protect a group of Indigenous people who had no contact with the modern world. What they found was a small basket freshly woven from leaves, a child’s footprints on the bank of a creek, and tree trunks hacked open hours before to extract honey. There were huts abandoned a year before that were sinking into the forest floor, and brazil nut pods discarded around old campfires. They were all signs that the A year later, the Brazilian government continues to ignore directives by the country’s approving a plan of measures to protect the isolated Indigenous community, including accelerating the demarcation of their territory and explaining how it would reduce deforestation. Bureaucratic delays, funding shortages and violent conflicts over land – including attacks by self-proclaimed leaders linked to loggers – have blocked the process. Without physical boundaries, loggers and ranchers continue to encroach, leaving the Kawahiva vulnerable to genocide and cultural erasure. Advocates call the stalling a deliberate, life-threatening violation of Brazil’s constitution. The presence of the Kawahiva people came as no surprise to Jair Candor, who led the expedition last year and who first confirmed their location in 1999. But their proposed 400,000-hectare (1m-acre) reserve still lacks full protection, as required by Brazil’s constitution, and remains the largest unprotected forest with uncontacted Indigenous people in Brazil. Just outside the reserve’s boundaries, the forest has been burned and cattle graze on recently cleared land. Fences and gates are being erected, and roads are stretching farther and farther into the forest. In an interview after the expedition, Janete Carvalho, director of territorial protection at Funai, the federal agency responsible for Indigenous lands, vowed to resolve the situation. “We are doing everything in our power to make sure that Kawahiva is demarcated in 2025,” she said. and was scheduled to announce new environmental achievements, including those related to Indigenous territories. But the climate conference came and went without a word about the Pardo River Kawahiva. Physical demarcation of the 200-mile (320km) perimeter of the Kawahiva’s territory involves placing concrete markers and signs along the boundary, and is a decisive step in convincing loggers and cattle farmers that the government is serious about its protection. But the demarcation remains stalled. Money has been one of the major stumbling blocks as the demarcation was to be funded by compensation received for the environmental impact of a highway in Mato Grosso state, which encompasses the territory. When that did not happen, Funai sought other sources of funding. It has now turned to the at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). “It’s a technical partnership that we’ve already had success with in other demarcations of Indigenous lands,” says Manoel Batista do Prado, Funai’s director of Indigenous land demarcation. “The fieldwork is scheduled to begin in early 2026.” The UFMG institute confirmed that it was in “advanced talks” with Funai, but did not say when or how it would present a plan for the demarcation work. The subtext to all this bureaucratic wheel-spinning is what Funai calls the “conflictual situation in the region”, which will require an armed police presence during the work. In 2018, an armed group of residents attacked the Funai base in the Kawahiva territory. In the ensuing gun battle, one of the attackers was killed. Six years later, during the Guardian and O Globo’s 2024 expedition to the region, heavily armed members of the national force police agency were stationed there. Earlier this year, the Guardian and O Globo obtained an audio recording in which a man threatened Funai’s Candor. Calling himself “Chief Francisco”, and thought to be Francisco das Chagas Paulo Rodrigues, who claims to be a chief affiliated with the Arara Indigenous Association, he called on local ranchers to reclaim the land “stolen by that scoundrel Jair”. He claimed to have conducted a six-day expedition within the Kawahiva Indigenous territory, “looking for those isolated Indians that Jair talks so much about”. “We can’t work because of this guy, but I have faith that we’re going to get him out of there,” he said in the recording. The self-styled chief is linked to loggers in the region and has allegedly committed several environmental crimes. He is facing charges in the federal civil and criminal court of Juína, including for the attempted murder of Candor during the armed attack on the Funai base. Elias Bigio, an anthropologist at the (Opi), says: “It has been 26 years since the confirmation of isolated Indigenous people on Kawahiva land and throughout this time, land-grabbers have always sought to overturn the land declaration in court, not to mention the threats and invasions that are still happening today. And now, once again, the demarcation is delayed.” He raises the possibility “that this is a political, not technical and legal, obstacle. So we fear that this may not happen even next year.” After that, he says, if a right-leaning government is elected, all Indigenous land demarcation is widely expected to stop, as was the case during the years when Jair Bolsonaro was president. Many see 2026 as the last chance for the Kawahiva territory project to be realised. The petition that led to the supreme court directive for the demarcation to go ahead was filed by the , a national organisation of Brazil’s Indigenous people. The court’s decision was clear: it ordered the federal government to present a firm schedule for completing the demarcation of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo territory, recognising the “risk of genocide, food insecurity and acculturation”. Ricardo Terena, a lawyer for Apib, describes the process as “stalled”. The supreme court has said it is awaiting compliance with the decision. “The delay in demarcation is not only illegal,” warns Priscilla Oliveira, representative of Survival International, an organisation that campaigns for “It is also extremely dangerous and puts the lives of the isolated Kawahiva Indigenous people at risk.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So why aren’t governments demanding more?,2025-11-11T09:30:13.000Z,"Anti-tobacco researchers have produced an index looking at the industry which  they say shows how companies are succeeding in influencing governments to ensure taxes remain flat or stubbornly low mid international aid cuts and a murky global economic outlook, health ministries and civil society groups around the world are worried about funding basic healthcare and prevention programmes. Public health is in a fragile state: it needs money. Countries are being advised to increase domestic revenues to bridge shortfalls, and taxing unhealthy products such as tobacco is a win-win. Higher taxes reduce demand and therefore the burden of related disease, while filling government coffers. The benefits of reducing tobacco use are significant, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where live, and where the burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest. Tobacco is one of the world’s leading causes of death, , including about 1.6 million non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke; many more become sick or disabled. The economic costs are staggering, estimated at (£1.3tn) in excess healthcare expenses and productivity losses in 2021 – the equivalent of 1.7% of global gross domestic product. That does not include the costs of tobacco-related environmental harm and food insecurity. Yet in many countries tobacco taxes remain flat or stubbornly low. The new shows that more than 60 of 100 countries surveyed did not raise tobacco taxes, delayed tax increases, lowered tax rates, or gave tax exemptions if products were manufactured for export in the past two years – often due to industry influence. Gabon, Jamaica and Kuwait, for example, have not increased tobacco taxes since 2017. Scheduled increases were delayed in countries including Ghana and Papua New Guinea. The index reveals examples of how the industry works to bend governments to its will. Typically, tobacco companies lobby non-health ministries, such as finance, agriculture and trade. Twenty countries were persuaded to collaborate with the tobacco industry to combat illicit trade through memorandums of understanding, training sessions, enforcement activities or the acceptance of resources in kind. The main industry argument is that higher taxes cause more illicit trade. It is a claim that has been repeatedly debunked in research studies, which show that is responsible for the hidden market. Nevertheless, these collaborations give the industry yet another path to lobby decision-makers, where it can continue to exaggerate the impact of taxes on illicit trade to sow fear among governments. Tobacco companies lobby finance and trade ministries, claiming that tax increases will harm the sector’s economic contribution, and positioning themselves as good corporate actors. British American Tobacco (BAT) is recognised as a “top taxpayer” in Bangladesh and Pakistan. In Cambodia, for being one of the largest taxpayers in 2024 – its reward is to be exempted from audit for two years. These measures send the message that these hugely profitable global companies should not have to pay more. , benefiting big companies including Massalin Particulares (Philip Morris International) and BAT, which could further lower prices for their cheaper brands and keep smokers hooked. A former And from Bangladesh to Cameroon, Malawi, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Uruguay and Venezuela, companies secured tax breaks for opening new tobacco factories, promising to use local tobacco leaf, or exporting tobacco – all activities they benefit from anyway. Rather than taking a marginal hit on their massive profits to pay poor tobacco farmers more, companies persuaded governments to subsidise tobacco growers instead. The big four global cigarette companies in 2024 made $125bn in revenue. Being a top taxpayer does not mean industry could not or should not pay more, particularly as research has revealed uses to reduce its tax obligations around the world. Yet too many governments are subsidising wealthy tobacco companies from the global north to sell products that harm health and the environment, while they and their people pay the price. At this critical moment, it is time for change. Tobacco taxes should go up more so people will smoke less and governments can fund other health priorities.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the country’s sudden democratic decay is more than just a national tragedy renewed sense of hope has taken root across the African continent. It is an optimism resting on solid ground: a booming population expected to surpass 2.5 billion by mid-century; vast reserves of critical minerals, oil and gas; and unprecedented levels of infrastructure investment. The African Development Bank (AfDB) projects that Africa’s combined GDP could reach $4tn (£3tn) by 2030, driven by green-energy investments, urbanisation and digital innovation. One of their senior economists told me confidently earlier this year: “The future will be written in Africa.” ” strategy has galvanised billions in financing and encouraged a renewed confidence in the continent’s future that is reflected across the diaspora. These transformations symbolise an inflection point: Africa rising on its own terms. Yet optimism is tempered by a sobering reality. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation’s 2024 African Report paints a stark picture. While youthful demographics and economic potential inspire hope, governance and security trends are moving backwards. , scores have declined for the first time in a decade. Nearly 30 African countries have experienced either coups, armed insurgencies or democratic backsliding since 2020. Conflict hotspots from Sudan, Congo and the Sahel to Ethiopia and Mozambique are displacing millions and eroding regional stability. The report notes that “the democratic dividend is at risk”, citing the silencing of opposition parties, manipulation of electoral commissions, and the use of security forces to consolidate power. These patterns threaten not only human rights but the very economic gains the AfDB celebrates. As Ibrahim warned: Good governance is the foundation upon which Africa’s progress must rest. Without it, development will crumble under the weight of corruption and repression.” The most recent example of democratic decay comes from , a country long praised for its stability and post-colonial unity. After gaining independence from Britain in 1961, Tanganyika – later the United Republic of Tanzania, after its 1964 union with Zanzibar – was a beacon of African liberation under Julius Nyerere. His African socialist policy of (“familyhood” in Swahili) emphasised equality and national cohesion. But this unity was built on the dominance of a single party: Chama Cha Mapinduzi (“Party of the Revolution”). Since 1977, CCM has ruled uninterrupted, under a series of leaders – from Ali Hassan Mwinyi to Benjamin Mkapa, Jakaya Kikwete, John Magufuli, and now Samia Suluhu Hassan. When Magufuli died suddenly in 2021, vice-president Hassan, a Zanzibari and the first woman to lead Tanzania, assumed office. Her early months offered great hope: she allowed media organisations banned by Magufuli to reopen, met opposition leaders and promised national reconciliation. But that promise has crumbled. As she sought re-election this year, Tanzania slid into authoritarianism. marked the nadir. Major opposition leaders, including Tundu Lissu of the Chadema party, were arrested or barred from contesting. Other prominent figures – such as Luhaga Mpina, of the Alliance for Change and Transparency (ACT Wazalendo) – were disqualified on technicalities. On polling day, the government blocked internet access, deployed the military and restricted independent observers. The , figures widely criticised as implausible and more reminiscent of autocracies than democracies. Observers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and civil society groups condemned the election as neither free nor fair. Calls have grown for independent investigations into human rights abuses and killings. In the days that followed, protests erupted across major cities including Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and Arusha. Eyewitnesses described unmitigated scenes of horror: soldiers firing on crowds, homes raided at night, and morgues filled beyond capacity. Estimates of deaths have ranged from dozens to thousands. but an umbrella group of African human rights organisations suggested may have been killed. Their calculations, based on observations at several hospitals and morgues overwhelmed with bodies, point to a scale of violence far beyond the official figures. Several prominent activists and political figures have gone missing. Among them are , an outspoken opposition organiser abducted from his home in May 2025 after repeated threats; , known as “Sativa”, a digital activist who survived a gunshot to the head after being kidnapped in June 2024; , a former intelligence officer for the opposition, found murdered with acid poured on his face in early 2025; and , Chadema’s deputy leader, reportedly detained incommunicado since last month. Opposition sources and humanitarian groups have accused state forces of digging mass graves outside Dar es Salaam and Arusha to conceal the scale of the killings. The government, however, denies any wrongdoing. In a , Tanzania’s foreign minister, Mahmoud Thabit Kombo, insisted there were no confirmed reports of deaths – a statement at odds with photographic and video evidence received by this author and also circulating on encrypted networks and social media. This descent into repression represents not just a national tragedy but a regional warning. Tanzania, once a pillar of stability and a host for liberation movements during Africa’s anti-colonial struggles, now mirrors the very autocracies it once opposed. Its degeneration underscores how fragile democratic gains remain across the continent. In gold-rich Uganda, another east African nation once celebrated for its liberation struggle, President Yoweri Museveni – now 81 and in power since 1986 – has said . Should he win again, it would extend his rule beyond four decades, perpetuating the cycle of constitutional manipulation and generational disillusionment. Uganda’s youth, who make up over 70% of its population, face a bleak political horizon where power changes only by mortality, not by mandate. Meanwhile, the continent’s two deadliest conflicts – in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo – continue to cause misery. In Sudan, the war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces , has reduced Khartoum to rubble, triggered famine, and driven more than 9 million people from their homes. In eastern Congo, fighting between government troops and the M23 rebel movement has reignited regional tensions, with and Uganda accused of backing armed proxies. These wars, fuelled by greed for minerals and control of trade routes, are destroying precisely the human and institutional foundations Africa needs for its much-vaunted “century of growth”. If the vision outlined by the African Development Bank and others is to be realised, the international community must act decisively to prevent the erosion of governance that threatens to derail Africa’s rise. should urgently launch an independent investigation into the killings, detentions and disappearances during Tanzania’s 2025 election. The African Union and SADC must press for accountability and remind member states of their democratic commitments under the For Africa’s century to truly belong to Africans, its leaders must understand that prosperity without liberty is hollow. The same youthful generation that powers Africa’s demographic boom deserves the right to speak, to organise and to vote without fear. If the continent is to harness its mineral and technological promise, it must first safeguard the dignity and lives of its people. The world cannot celebrate Africa’s economic rise while ignoring the blood staining the streets. Tanzania’s tragedy is not an isolated event – it reflects the broader struggle for democracy across the continent. Africa cannot rise if leaders fear ballots more than war. And until the cries of the silenced are heard, the dream of an African future will remain unfinished.",Kenneth Mohammed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She quickly headed out, hoping to avoid the crowd that had already burned down the offices of Prothom Alo, another of Bangladesh’s most prestigious newspapers. But when she reached the door, they were already there. , a prominent leader from the pro-democracy movement that unseated the in August 2024. Hadi’s killers were Hasina loyalists who had escaped to India, according to the authorities. The crowd that had rapidly gathered on the night of 18 December was ready to lash out at anyone they saw as linked to the previous government. Prothom Alo and the Daily Star were targeted, despite having faced vandalism, abuse and legal action under Hasina’s rule. It was a night that saw both newspaper offices and a cultural institution burned down, causing consternation among journalists and civil society about the trajectory of Bangladesh just 15 months after the end of Hasina’s 15 years of autocratic rule for a new type of politics. this year in incidents of mob violence, according to figures up to November compiled by the human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra. Last Thursday, a Hindu garment worker was dragged out and lynched after rumours had spreadaccusing him of blasphemy. By comparison, there were 51 such deaths in 2023. As the violence erupted on 18 December, Islam, a 35-year-old reporter, and 28 of her colleagues rushed to the roof hoping to wait out the violence. “We all knew that this mob was not going to stop at trashing this office, that it was going to set fire to it,” she says. At one point, choking on smoke so thick she could not see the phone in her hands, Islam posted to Facebook what she thought would her final message: “I can’t breathe any more. There’s too much smoke. I’m inside. You are killing me.” The violence was an example of how the interim government has struggled in a chaotic environment and has raised concerns about how it will handle tensions that are likely to be heightened in the run-up to an election expected in February. The Daily Star attack came after plenty of warnings; Prothom Alo had already been burned down, and calls had been made by journalists at both newspapers to members of the government. When firefighters tried to bring some of the workers down by ladder, they were set on, and it was not until about 4am that the military arrived to escort them out. Shafiqul Alam, press secretary for Bangladesh’s interim leader, , posted on Facebook that he had made scores of calls “to the right people” without success. “I wish I could dig up a great piece of earth and bury myself in shame,” he later wrote. A journalist from Prothom Alo, who did not want to be named, said that watching from the 13th floor of the building as the crowd gathered belowmade them realise how just far the country had strayed from the hope of August 2024. Hasina’s rule saw the political opposition crushed and the media silenced, but when she was removed last year, the young protest leaders spoke of a “Bangladesh 2.0”, which would break away from the violence and retribution of the old political parties. “I took part in [the movement] because we were in a dungeon for 15 years under [Hasina’s] Awami League rule. But for the first time in the last 16 months, I thought, ‘have we just plunged to our nadir?’” the journalist says. He has generally felt freer than under the previous government to report on criticism of the government and political parties, but the violence has shaken him. “Awami League’s time was bad – Prothom Alo was threatened and attacked,” he says. “But [it’s shocking] being attacked in this way and getting no help whatsoever from the government – they surrendered to the mob.” Zia Chowdhury, a reporter at an English-language daily, the Business Standard, says all journalists and civil society activists are now feeling vulnerable. “[It’s left] a sense of fear of being hounded by angry groups when I’m on the ground, when I’m asking any critical questions. There was much hope since the interim government took charge but the hope has diminished slowly,” says Chowdhury. Islam says she would not have wanted the security forces to fire on the crowds but more should have been done to protect the journalists. She is also concerned that Bangladesh has been held hostage by a cycle of retribution since the 2024 protests that saw and which were followed by attacks on the police and anyone deemed loyal to her Awami League party. Islam believes, however, that there is a chance to escape that cycle of violence by taking last week’s attacks as a warning and encouraging the government to act. One way to do that, she says, is to ensure that those arrested are genuine culprits and not justdetentions in the sweeping police raids that are common in Bangladesh, simply to signal that action is being taken, she says. “I have my fingers crossed that that’s the one thing that doesn’t happen because I don’t want to perpetuate a culture of revenge. “We still have a little hope. It’s still not time to worry and go into full-blown panic yet.”",Kaamil Ahmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/11/the-town-on-the-banks-of-the-nile-that-turned-floods-into-fortune,The town on the banks of the Nile that turned floods into fortune,2025-12-11T08:00:00.000Z,"After record flooding submerged Bor in South Sudan in 2020, the emergency response ended up turning it into a beacon of climate crisis adaptation he three friends fill yellow jerrycans and help each other lift them on to their heads for the short walk home. Nyandong Chang lives five minutes from the water kiosk and is here up to six times a day. “It’s still hard work,” she says, “but at least nowadays water is available and clean.” Until last year, women and children in Bor, the capital of South Sudan’s Jonglei state, faced a much tougher chore – going all the way to the filthy stretch of the White Nile that runs near the town to draw the family’s drinking, washing and cooking water and carry it back. “It was dirty and could make people sick at home, but we had no other option,” says Chang. But that was before Bor’s new water treatment plant transformed the town in what is being seen as a beacon of climate crisis adaptation. Bor was entirely submerged when the White Nile broke its banks in late 2020. Although used to its seasonal overflow – means flood in the Dinka language – it was flooding people here had not seen for 60 years. Parts of Jonglei have remained under water, and extreme flooding, which experts say is down to climate breakdown, has this year displaced close to 380,000 South Sudanese people, according to the But Bor has recovered, and last month a completed $5.4m (£4m) project, funded by the Netherlands and South Korea, was formally handed over to the management of the state-owned corporation (SSUWC). “In 2020, the major flood emergency really eroded the infrastructure, including the water-supply system, and that left the community hugely vulnerable to waterborne diseases,” says Thewodros Mulugeta, Unicef’s chief of water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) in South Sudan. “So the initial phase of the project started as a humanitarian, critical emergency response. Then there was a strategic shift to finding long-term, durable solutions to the water supply.” Dykes were built along the river and drainage systems established for rainwater. An existing treatment plant was overhauled into a “climate-resilient” installation: built on raised ground, it runs on solar power, minimising running costs and carbon emissions. “Bor, like no other town, knows the challenge of water,” says Jacob Chol, a Jonglei state minister. “We live along the bank of the majestic Nile, yet accessing reliable drinking water has remained a persistent challenge for too long.” The governor of Jonglei state, Riek Gai Kok, also praised the project as something that “will restore the dignity of our people”. It has brought jobs – 30 core staff have been trained for the plant – electricians, pump mechanics, plumbers and lab technicians to test the water quality, with accountants to oversee revenue. Manager John Jurkuch Yaak is confident in the plant’s sustainability after international partners withdraw: “We won’t let anybody down,” he says. Commercial management was, he adds, crucial: “How to read the meters, how to prepare the bills, how to produce reports about the consumption to present to the stakeholders … so that customers can trust our service,” he says. To date, 28 community kiosks, 704 households, seven schools and a hospital have been connected to the 33-mile pipe network. With 96,000 users, 80% of Bor’s population, there should be revenue to sustain and expand. By local standards, the price of 3,500 South Sudanese pounds (about 60p) for a cubic metre is affordable for most people. Water kiosks are managed by women such as Adeng Lek, a widow feeding her four children thanks to this job. She says the kiosks have become a social hub. “This water has changed many lives. People can come here with their bottle to drink for free,” she says. Regular customers pay about 2p for a 20-litre jerrycan. Near Bor’s reservoir, Achol Teresa’s house has been connected: a pipe with a tap and a meter stands in her garden, where she grows okra, bananas, mangoes and coffee. The irrigation means she has been able to harvest okra three times this year. “I pay the water bill from the sale of my products in the market,” she says. She shares, giving water to three elderly neighbours. “It used to take us more than one hour to fill just one jerrycan before. At the borehole, the queue was long. This water has made everything easier.” St Andrew high is among the schools connected this year. The head teacher, John Kuer Barach, says attendance and performance have improved since water arrived. “We used to have only one shift, in the morning, then because of the lack of drinking water here, the kids would then go home and return only the next day. But now, their parents are happy to let them come back for the afternoon class.” Students also noticed a big change says Nathaniel Thon, 17. “When the flooding came in 2020, there was a lot of stagnant water and it brought many diseases. I caught bilharzia because we didn’t have good water here in school, only one borehole and the water was not purified. It gave a lot of stress to my parents, because they had to buy bottled water from the shop, on top of paying school fees. We don’t see such problems any more.” The taps mean less work too for girls, who can now be in class. “Going to bring water from the borehole was very dangerous for us,” says Abuol Agou, 14. “We had to cross the street to go to the borehole, and carrying a jerrycan is not easy. I was almost hit by a car, I was very scared.” Her friend Tuna, 13, says the school has become a better place for girls having their period. “We don’t have to stay at home, we can wash and change here at school and not miss our lessons.” What is changing lives in Bor however is still not the wider reality – only have access to drinking water within a 30-minute walk, says Mulugeta. “Massive investment is required to bring the sector to a basic, acceptable level,” he says. Yar Paul Kuol, managing director at SSUWC, overseeing five national water treatment plants, considers Bor a model facility because of its low running costs. As international aid and funding is increasingly hard to find, she adds: “We want to see the government funding such projects before we start asking the donors.” Ssemabira Steven and Sserwanja Hamza sell water door to door. The two Ugandans, who came to Bor looking for work seven years ago, transport 10 jerry cans at a time on their bicycles. They fill them up at the kiosk, then wheel their bikes around the neighbourhoods in all weathers, until all the water is sold. “Since they have changed the system, water is available all day long, and it is saving our time and energy,” says Sserwanja Hamza “Before, we have been suffering. We would not be able to serve all our customers. We were under pressure. But now we can get water anytime.” They do not mind that they have lost custom, as families connected to the new water system no longer need their services. “We used to go fetch water from the riverside when the water was closed here, and that water is not good, people got sick. Now, no need to spend all that energy,” Ssemabira Steven says. “I need only 10 minutes to go and serve my customers.”",Florence Miettaux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The room had once been an investigation office, converted into a cell after authorities decided to move the women out of the main area, where they had been held alongside male detainees. When I returned a year later, the space had been transformed. The women had made it their own, covering the walls with names, phrases and small drawings of hearts, even taping up a poster of the Colombian singer Maluma. What had once been a sterile office now held traces of their presence, their effort to hold on to a sense of identity in a place meant to erase it. On one wall, someone had carved a phrase of both defiance and exhaustion: “I don’t expect anyone to believe in me because I don’t believe in anyone.” You see women resting on thin mattresses on the floor, bodies intertwined, one woman’s legs serving as a pillow for another, as if physical closeness were the only comfort left in that airless room. Here, for them, meant limbo: no ventilation, no running water, and days that bled into one another. Many did not know their lawyers, did not know when their trial would be, did not receive food, water or medical attention regularly; they waited in a kind of deranged inactivity for the possibility of a visit. Two women in the image stayed with me long after I walked out of that room. Daniela, wearing the pink T-shirt, had been sentenced long before I met her. When I first photographed her in 2017, her family was unaware of her whereabouts. She had simply disappeared into the system. When I returned a year later, she told me her daughter had been diagnosed with leukaemia. The woman in yellow is Roxana. She had lived on the streets and struggled with addiction, and by the time we met, she had a liver abscess caused by long-term drug and alcohol use. She was also HIV positive. Every week, her father appeared with her medication and food; offering the steady presence of someone who refuses to give up. She was in and out of jail for years. Once, after a release, I visited her at home. She was thin, sick and exhausted. In 2020, she told me she had survived a gunshot to the leg. That was the turning point, she said. She stopped drinking and using drugs, moved back in with her father and began studying. Today, she is enrolled at a university and has written a book about her life. This photograph is part of my ongoing series (Eternal Days).

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/03/whistleblower-accuses-foreign-office-of-censoring-warning-of-sudan-genocide,Whistleblower accuses Foreign Office of ‘censoring’ warning of Sudan genocide,2025-12-03T11:40:31.000Z,"Analyst claims UK officials deleted alert to threat of genocidal violence by paramilitaries to protect UAE Warnings of a possible “genocide” in Sudan were removed from a UK risk assessment by Foreign Office officials, according to a whistleblower whose testimony raises fresh concern over British The threat analyst said they were prevented from warning that genocide could occur in Darfur by Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) officials in a risk assessment collated days after Sudan’s The analyst, requesting anonymity, believes the decision may have been taken to protect the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a key UK ally “The word genocide was removed from our report. Anyone who has studied – its patterns of behaviour – knew genocide was a risk,” said the analyst, who produced frequent assessments for the FCDO, reports which can be disseminated throughout government departments. It amounted to “censoring”, they said, and was particularly disturbing as the UK is the UN security council’s “ meaning it leads the council’s activities on the conflict. Agreed by many as the gravest of all crimes against humanity, genocide is understood to refer to the mass extermination of a particular group of people, such as the attempts of the Nazis to eradicate the Jewish population in the 1940s. Conceived as a response to the Holocaust, the – better known as the 1948 UN genocide convention – was the first legal instrument to codify genocide as an offence, defining it as an act committed with the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Behind this relatively simple definition lies a complex web of legal concepts concerning when and how the term can be applied. UN bodies have said they believe genocide to have occurred in in 2025. Judgments of the international court of justice are awaited on all. Meanwhile, a former FCDO official linked to the department’s atrocity prevention team told the Guardian that they also believed the suppression of the risk of genocide in Sudan was to protect the UAE from scrutiny. Difficulties raising atrocity concerns over Darfur, they said, were comparable to problems they experienced flagging human rights concerns relating to conflict in the They likened the way in which the UK maintained – despite Kigali’s military support for the M23 militia in eastern Congo – with how the UK has stayed close to the UAE despite its backing for the RSF (which the Gulf state denies). DRC atrocity assessments were “dropped for political reasons”, the former official claimed, adding: “That pattern of behaviour looks to have been repeated for Sudan.” However, the FCDO said a formal determination of genocide was never a political consideration. A spokesperson said: “The UK does not make formal determinations of genocide on the basis of politics. “It does so based on the judgment of a competent court, after consideration of all the evidence available in the context of a credible judicial process, and there is currently no such judgment in the context of Sudan.” Shortly after the April 2023 report warning of genocide was finalised for the FCDO, ethnic violence was already sweeping through Darfur. This vast western region is where the Janjaweed, the predominantly Arab militia that was the forerunner of the RSF, estimated to have killed 300,000 Sudanese two decades ago. Two months after the allegedly censored document, was committed by the RSF in the Darfuri city of El Geneina. The UN estimates about 15,000 people from non-Arab and ethnic African communities were killed. The analyst alleged that even after the atrocities in El Geneina, the word genocide was prohibited from their risk assessments. El Fasher, another regional capital in Darfur, was seized by the RSF last month, prompting that experts have likened to the opening days of the genocide in Rwanda. With the city sealed off and in effect a massive crime scene, intelligence suggests the RSF has spent weeks disposing of evidence, with experts detecting mass graves and possibly . Tens of thousands of the city’s residents are still missing. Days after Sudan’s war began on 15 April 2023, analysts submitted an assessment to FCDO officials outlining possible crisis scenarios that could also be passed to the UN’s early-warning systems, British intelligence or “Cobra” meetings, where senior ministers convene to coordinate the emergency response to a disaster. The analyst said that instead of being allowed to warn of the “risk of genocide in Darfur”, they had to state instead that there was a danger that might return to conflicts previously witnessed in the region. “I didn’t understand the head-in-the-sand attitude – the need to find more amenable language to an obvious risk,” they added. The final report has been seen by the Guardian but specific details are not being reported to protect the identity of authors. Abdallah Abu Garda, chair of the UK-based Darfur Diaspora Association, said the news raised “extremely grave” issues. “Our concern is that Foreign Office officials appear to have deliberately downplayed the risk of genocide precisely as Sudan was descending into one of the worst episodes of mass atrocities in recent memory,” he said. For years before war erupted, experts had issued warnings of the rising risks of mass atrocities in Sudan. , an umbrella organisation of human rights groups, wrote to ministers with concerns “that the UK’s systems, capabilities and policies towards Sudan still lack a focus on atrocity prevention, grievance and political marginalisation”. These warnings were repeated in June 2023, as atrocities were committed in El Geneina. Experts on the foreign affairs select committee of continuing risks of atrocities across Sudan and that the FCDO’s Sudan team was ill-equipped to respond. Kate Ferguson, a foreign policy expert on mass violence, and co-executive director of , told MPs that she believed even “when those warnings are being raised, whether in West Darfur or in Khartoum, [the FCDO] don’t have a system by which those warnings can be easily, rapidly and urgently raised to the ministerial office”. Approached for comment on what she felt had changed since 2023, Ferguson said: “It is difficult to see how our years of raising alarm of genocide returning to Darfur, and of warning the FCDO they needed to prioritise atrocity prevention, has translated into clear UK policy to prevent or protect – even now, with tens of thousands missing from El Fasher, facing unthinkable peril or [who] are already dead.” “Halting genocide is not easy but it is possible,” she added. “That’s why it is essential our foreign secretary and prime minister have full confidence in the analysis of atrocity violence they receive and that prevention options passed up for decision-making match ministerial ambitions and obligations to protect civilians in Sudan. “The RSF’s assault on black and Indigenous civilians will continue – our government’s expertise and systems must be fit for the urgent purpose of averting further catastrophe in [nearby] Meanwhile, the former FCDO expert within the , revealed that raising atrocity concerns over Darfur was similar to problems they had experienced relating to the Congo. “We were persistently warning about atrocity risks in DRC, but this was the time of the government’s [the UK’s proposed scheme to send asylum seekers to Kigali] and they didn’t want to know because it would go against British interests. “It felt we were getting into very similar territory on Sudan. You need to consider the [United Arab] Emirates to explain why people were struggling with how to talk about Sudan. “What I can say is that from the outset of the war, evidence started to come in about Emirati involvement, progressively more and more,” said the former FCDO official. The UAE has repeatedly denied providing arms to the RSF. At the same time, the former official added, the FCDO was amassing evidence that genocide was likely to unfold again in Darfur. They said that a system for tracking the Sudan conflict was monitoring RSF recruits who had expressed ambitions to eradicate ethnic Africans from Darfur. “People were expressing genocidal intent,” they said. Although the US formally declared in January that in Sudan by members of the RSF, the UK has not followed suit. The UK has said the determination of genocide was an to decide, but it would act to prevent atrocities. However, the former FCDO expert said this did not explain why genocide was removed from the early-warning report. “In this scenario, its use is totally acceptable because you’re portraying a worst-case scenario that would be difficult to describe without saying the word,” they added. An FCDO source said the UK was committed to upholding its obligations under the UN genocide convention and strongly advocated for accountability for all breaches of international law. They added that the UK supported the work of the and the international criminal court and was funding a project to document and verify attacks on civilians. Abu Garda added: “Britain’s failure to properly assess and recognise ongoing atrocities has fostered impunity and contributed directly to further genocidal campaigns in El Geneina, , and now in El Fasher. “The British government must uphold its moral and legal responsibilities and act decisively to prevent genocide rather than minimise or obscure it for political or economic convenience.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It will almost halve the already diminished aid pot, from 0.58% of national income to 0.3%. In 2023, the total aid spend was £15.34bn, almost a third of which was spent on supporting and housing refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. was a quarter of a century ago, in 1999. Starmer’s move raised concerns among and made migration more likely, and outraged humanitarians and aid agencies who warned of a “devastating” impact on the world’s poorest. , prompting warnings that lives would be lost in countries relying on US support. UK overseas aid has historically risen during Labour governments, most noticeably after Tony Blair came to power in 1997 with a pledge to meet the UN’s target of 0.7% of gross national income. The UN general assembly set the target in 1970 for developed countries to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA), to promote the economic development and welfare of poorer nations. The Blair administration, with Gordon Brown as chancellor, set out to reverse a fall in aid spend, , over 18 years of Tory government. Blair set up the Department for International Development (DfID), to focus on reducing poverty, making aid more effective, improving the lives of women and girls and fighting climate change. Blair committed to achieve 0.7% by 2013. and was met every year from In 2021, at the height of the Covid pandemic, then prime minister Boris Johnson said the economic impacts at home would result in a temporary reduction in ODA spend to 0.5% of GNI. The previous year, Johnson had controversially merged DfID with the Foreign Office. The Starmer government had committed to restoring the 0.7% spend as soon as fiscal circumstances allowed. In 2023, official figures show the top three country recipients of bilateral aid were Ukraine (£250m), Ethiopia (£164m) and Afghanistan (£115m). Keir Starmer has said the UK will continue to support Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, as well as contribute to climate finance and global health. Regionally, the continent of Africa is the largest regional recipient of UK aid, at £1,229m. . Based on the most recent forecasts for GNI, reducing aid spend to Almost a third, 28% or £4.3bn, of aid went on support for refugees or asylum seekers in the UK or other donor countries in 2023, a dramatic rise from the 3.2%, or £400m, in 2020. Britain’s reported costs for each refugee or asylum seeker is many times that of other major European countries, due in part to a shortage of UK accommodation, leading to the Home Office housing people in hotels. Humanitarian aid (15.3%) and health (13.3%) were the two largest sectors for bilateral aid in 2023, at £878m and £764m. Before the pandemic, humanitarian spending was about 15% to 16% of bilateral aid, but was reduced by half in 2021 after the pandemic, to 10.3%, from £1.3bn to £743m. In 2022 and 2023, the UK provided £592m to humanitarian crises in Ukraine, after the Russian invasion, and £467m to Afghanistan, after the Taliban takeover in 2021. It announced an increase in support for victims of the conflict in Sudan in 2025, to £226.5m. in absolute terms and the ninth highest in terms of percentage of GNI.",Karen McVeigh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/19/gaza-phd-student-manar-al-houbi-granted-access-to-uk-but-others-remain-stranded,Gaza PhD student and family evacuated to UK after Foreign Office U-turn,2025-12-19T10:00:02.000Z,"Manar al-Houbi’s family had been denied entry despite a scholarship covering their living costs, but other students remain stranded The UK government has finally evacuated Manar al-Houbi, the student who won a fully funded scholarship to pursue her PhD at the University of Glasgow, along with her family from the war-ravaged territory this week. In October, the Guardian highlighted Houbi’s to get her family evacuated after they were denied entry to the UK, despite her scholarship and visa permitting her to bring them. As part of a UK crackdown on immigration, most international students have been prevented from bringing their dependants. Shortly after Houbi’s story, the UK government made a , stating it would support the evacuation of dependants on a “case-by-case basis”. Houbi and her family have now reached Jordan and will shortly travel to the UK. They are the only family travelling together from Gaza whose evacuation the British government has facilitated. Most students have had no choice but to leave their families behind, while others have simply refused to take up their places. Set to expire on 31 December 2025, the has been described by students as beset by delays, poor communication and uncertainty. It has left students stuck in Gaza, where conditions have amid floods, escalating food shortages and disease. Some told the Guardian that they felt pressure from the UK government to travel without their children despite the recent policy change stating they could bring them. When Wahhaj Muhammad, 32, was advised by the (FCDO) to consider evacuating alone, he believed his family would soon follow. But two months have passed, and his wife and two children remain trapped in Gaza with no clear timeline or assurances from the UK on when they will join him. Since arriving to study for his PhD in Glasgow, Muhammad says he has been consumed by guilt. “The uncertainty affects every aspect of my life here,” he says. “It’s difficult to settle, to feel present or to engage academically when the people you love most remain living under constant threat.” Muhammad has received no explanation for why his family was not on the last evacuation bus that left this week. British officials said they remained “hopeful” that they would be able to evacuate in the new year but have offered no guarantees. Another two eligible students who refused to leave their families behind and were not permitted to evacuate this week do not know if they will need to defer their studies for another year or risk losing their places altogether. Amany Shaher expected to have settled well into her master of research at the University of Bristol by now. Instead, as the autumn term draws to a close, she is certain that she will not make it out of the enclave this year. “None of us know if the UK’s student evacuation scheme will be extended or not,” says Shaher. “We haven’t been given any clear guidance or timelines and have no idea what 2026 will bring.” The 34-year-old mother of three says when presented with the choice of travelling alone, without her children, she felt nauseous. “How can I even consider leaving my children behind in Gaza?” she asks. “Nowhere else in the world would a mother be expected to part so easily from her children. It’s dehumanising. We have a right to stick together as a family and not be forced to separate – that should not be too much to ask.” Mohammed Aldalou has a scholarship to pursue his master of research and PhD at the London School of Economics (LSE). But for the past six months, he has been locked in a bureaucratic limbo with British authorities, which he described being “almost as traumatic as the war itself”. His five-year-old son is severely autistic and non-verbal, and has been without access to treatment for two years. Yet the FCDO has suggested Aldalou take the opportunity to leave while he can – but he refuses. “They should ask themselves what they would do if they were in my shoes,” he says. Without the guarantee of evacuating together as a family, Aldalou insists there will be no leaving Gaza. “It’s heartbreaking that, after everything we’ve been through, we’re being asked to make this impossible decision.” Last week, during a closed meeting between the department for education and universities, there was discussion of whether students still stuck in Gaza could begin studies online and if the evacuation scheme could be extended to allow later arrival. However, sources told the Guardian it was unlikely that the FCDO would extend the scheme without Home Office approval. The FCDO declined further comment, while the department for education said it had nothing to add.",Thaslima Begum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then they sought him out. How Sudan lost ‘a true hero of the war’,2025-11-02T12:00:03.000Z,"For months, Mohamed Khamis Douda shared accounts of what life was like under siege. He was killed when RSF fighters finally took the Darfur city, raising fears activists and civil society figures are being hunted down or months, militiamen on the perimeters of El Fasher have asked those few who managed to escape the besieged Sudanese city whether Mohamed Khamis Douda was still inside. They shared videos threatening to kill him, which, as they hoped, made their way to the activist. Even as the hunger and fear of living under siege and bombardment made him desperate to leave, Douda remained inside El Fasher, constantly working to let the outside world know what was happening to the people there. Then, on Sunday 26 October, Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and it was too late. His friends and family have confirmed to the Guardian that Douda has been killed. As the official spokesperson for Zamzam, the displacement camp in Sudan’s Darfur region, Douda found himself at the centre of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe. there in April in which hundreds of civilians were killed, he had to be carried to the relative safety of nearby El Fasher. Since then, Douda had been in regular contact with the Guardian, describing daily survival in a place that for months has seemed In the lead up to the assault on Sunday, the RSF had squeezed El Fasher’s inhabitants by throttling supplies of food, water and medicine, and building earthen barriers tocontrol who moved in and out. These are some of the accounts Douda shared with the Guardian: I awake each morning tired from the efforts of the previous day. Our first struggle is the merciless hunger and the second is the constant artillery shelling. Even the glow of a cigarette can alert the drones that fly overhead, so once we finish our meals there is nothing to do but sit in silence, listening to the sound of the buzzing drone and the explosions. This is our daily life, we live in hope that this nightmare will one day end. Douda said it felt as if he was being followed by drones. Many nights were spent inside a crude bomb shelter made from a metal container buried in the ground. He spent the nights in silence and darkness, afraid of the drones and explosions he could hear around him. Each day started with the search for food. The goal was always to try to find some millet or sorghum flour but as food dwindled, he inevitably had to rely on – a residue left over from the production of crushing peanuts for oil production. It was usually fed to animals but in El Fasher people were grinding it down and boiling it into an – the Sudanese staple food usually made from grains such as sorghum or wheat. By the end, Douda said people were eating cattle hides because even the ombaz had run out. He balanced his struggle for survival with trying to support those around him. With friends he helped to deliver food or water and he documented rights abuses while also organising burials for the dead. He believed it was this that attracted the ire of the RSF, when he shared information about I awoke to the sounds of explosions in the northern part of the city, near the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people. Then I heard a roar from the south-east. I looked up and saw two drones. I rushed to nearby homes and told them to take shelter. We spent the day in silence, listening to the shelling and machine guns for more than six hours before finally the good news came that the RSF had been expelled. There are 60 martyrs and 100 injured. I went with my friend Ahmed to visit the wounded – there were countless women and children hit by stray bullets. We helped the teams supporting them and organising the burials for the dead. On our way home I suggested to my friend that we leave the city. He went silent, then showed me videos on his phone of young men being tortured by the RSF between El Fasher and the Tawila area after they had tried to leave El Fasher. “Then it’s better for us to stay here until the end,” I said. Douda’s phone often went silent for long periods, but each time he would return with the latest updates from the city. In September, it seemed El Fasher was going to fall when the RSF carried out a heavy attack on the Abu Shouk and Daraja Oula areas, including the When he came back online, Douda said people could no longer move and tried to spend their days inside their makeshift bomb shelters but the unbearable heat made it difficult to remain there. I cannot leave the house any more, even to get some food. The people who ran the community kitchens, to feed people, they cannot leave either. Whenever someone moves, the drones attack. I spend all my time thinking about how I can escape the city but as much as I try, I cannot work out how. I hear that the RSF are trying to find me because I speak out against them. When they find people leaving the city they show them my picture and ask if I am still here. Every day, the RSF gets closer and they are ready to kill everyone in El Fasher. The world needs to act quickly. Despite Douda’s regular updates through Facebook and directly to media, nothing changed. Within a day of last Sunday’s attack, news began to come in of arrests such as that of Al Jazeera’s , a former MP who had helped to feed people through El Fasher’s community kitchens. Campaign group Avaaz immediately raised concern that the RSF were hunting down activists and searching phones for any sign of communication with the media or human rights groups. “This is the loss of an entire generation of Sudanese activists and Sudanese youth, who not only led the revolution [of 2019] and lived the values of peace, justice and freedom,” says Shayna Lewis, at Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities. “That generation is being strategically wiped out with reports of lists that the RSF have of civil society members.” Lewis describes Douda as a hero who gave his life to highlight atrocities in Zamzam and El Fasher. “I can’t overstate how much of a loss Mohamed’s death is for the wider community of civil society, for Sudan as a country, losing one of the true heroes of the war.”",Kaamil Ahmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Laly Joseph, 56, at the helm, dozens of women from the local neighbourhood were in charge of preserving and cultivating more than 2,000 species of native plants either ignored or forgotten by the rest of the world. Together, they are more Joseph started working in conservation when she was 19, learning the ropes from her mentor Wolfgang Theuerkauf, a self-taught German conservationist. Her deep knowledge and excitement was palpable as she showed me around the Gurukula botanical sanctuary, explaining the intricacies of caring for numerous varieties of rare and sensitive flora needing very specific conditions to thrive and propagate. Watching Joseph move through the nursery with a determined stride and singular purpose felt oddly comforting, even as I knew biodiversity collapse was occurring at unprecedented rates outside the confines of this secluded haven. It reminded me of the incredible power of small acts of preservation that can snowball over decades to create a forest like no other. For some, death only magnifies their courage. who stood up to her country’s genocidal paramilitaries, is among those whose legend has deepened over time, a symbol of the fortitude of Sudan’s women but also the savagery of its spiralling war. Those fortunate to have known her describe a diminutive, grinning nurse whose enthusiasm powered the small health clinic she ran in Zamzam, a vast refugee camp in Darfur, at the centre of the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis. Everybody knew Hanadi. Had there been a popularity contest among the camp’s 400,000 residents, the 22-year-old would probably have won. But it was in her last hours that Hanadi’s iconic status was forged. Surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned by the Hanadi fought off waves of attackers armed only with a knife. In between, witnesses told how she tended injured comrades on the frontline. As the RSF advanced, footage of Hanadi urging residents to defend their camp swept across social media. The camp was where her family had fled to because of a . It was supposed to be their sanctuary. The footage outraged RSF’s leadership. An RSF kill squad was sent to silence her, assassinating her at close range, while elsewhere in the camp other paramilitaries executed children and raped their mothers. Perhaps the fundamental importance of Hanadi’s heroism is that it was far from unique. Hundreds of women from Darfur have been killed this year, valiantly but vainly defending their homes and families against the hi-tech weaponry of the RSF. Their stories, largely untold, are – for now at least – represented by Hanadi. What first struck me about Sonia Bonfim Vicente was her quiet resolve in the face of personal tragedy and systemic injustice. Four years ago, her husband, William, and 17-year-old son, Samuel, were shot dead by police as they rode a motorbike through their favela. (Samuel’s girlfriend, who they were taking to hospital, was severely injured.) In her search for answers, Vicente has met with closed doors, hostility and intimidation. She has kept going, channelling her grief into a struggle for justice that is shared by countless other mothers in Brazil, where police kill more than 6,000 people every year and are rarely held to account. This October, left about 130 dead; half were Vicente spoke calmly as she showed me the thick file of evidence she has accumulated – along with a vast understanding of the legal system and her rights, which she now shares with other mothers. Like her, they tend to be Black women from a poor background, too often ignored by the state that killed their sons. staging demonstrations and providing comfort to each other. “When I’m supporting other mothers, I forget about my own case,” says Vicente. “I have to be strong.” Amy Mbaye is a midwife running a health post in Joal, a fishing town a few hours’ drive south of Dakar in Senegal. I met her when I went , taking contraception to the women who live there. The post building had seen better days – it was raining when we arrived and buckets were strewn across the floor to catch drips from the leaking roof. Mbaye told me the clinic struggles for even basic resources such as disposable gloves. There is no running water in the bathroom, and power cuts are a regular fact of life. But for thousands of local peopple it is the only healthcare facility available. The women gathered for the contraceptive clinic knew it – and Mbaye – well. She had delivered a lot of their babies. The town is getting poorer as fishing yields dwindle, driven by the climate crisis and industrial overfishing off the coast. There is no national health service providing free treatment in , and cost is a barrier to care. It means that sometimes when Mbaye calls a woman for a check-up she can’t afford to come. Mbaye and her colleague, a nurse, will sometimes pay out of their own salary, she said, but they can’t do that for everyone. She knows she is not providing the gold-standard treatment she would like to, but is proud never to have lost a woman in childbirth at the clinic. She told me the women of the town were warriors. I told her I thought she was one, too. I first interviewed Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif for a story on his colleague Fadi al-Wahidi, who had been by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while reporting in northern Gaza. Sharif had been with Wahidi during the attack, and described how they had run for cover as they were relentlessly pursued and fired at. The weight of that moment lingered with Sharif as he spoke. Yet even then, what impressed me most was his composure, his clarity and his refusal to let fear overshadow the truth. Only later did I learn that Sharif had carried Wahidi on a stretcher from one hospital to the next due to Israel’s siege on the medical facility; details he had quietly left out. When I pressed him, he simply said he did what anyone would. Over the following months, Sharif helped me with other stories from . He was kind, deeply knowledgable and generous with his time. We were due to speak again for a piece on how starvation was affecting Gaza journalists’ ability to work. But that interview never happened. On 10 August 2025, while reporting from inside a press tent outside al-Shifa hospital. , his press credentials endangered him. Over the past two years, Gaza has become . According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Israel is carrying out “the most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists” ever documented. Yet Sharif remained in Gaza, even when given the opportunity to leave, because he believed Gaza’s story needed to be told. He embodied courage and journalistic integrity in their purest form. Sharif’s death is a profound loss – for his family, for Gaza, and for anyone who still believes the truth is worth risking everything for. For more than a decade, Willis Chimano, a member of Sauti Sol, Africa’s biggest boyband, kept his sexuality a secret for fear of derailing his music career. Then, in 2018, a photograph of Chimano with his partner was posted on social media and republished by the mainstream press in . He was the first pop star in the country to be outed as gay – and social media went wild. that still criminalises queer people. Gay sex is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. when he came to London to perform his one-man show, Heavy is the Crown. He told me about the aftermath of being outed as queer. “There was vitriol, oh my God, so much,” he said. “People were saying ‘you’re a sinner’, ‘it goes against the laws of nature’, ‘it’s against African culture’. There’s a larger society belief that what [queer people] are doing is wrong. People don’t understand.” Since then, Chimano has been coming to terms with everything he faced. His show is full of pain and anger, but also hope. When I interviewed him, he was funny, engaging and generous; he spoke openly about what he has been through and what life is like as one of Kenya’s biggest celebrities who is also gay. He has taken on the role of activist as well as pop star. And, he didn’t tell me this, but he’s also been a huge source of inspiration and comfort for many queer people across the continent, and their families. Dr Abraha Gebreegziabher still remembers the first of the girls who walked through his door. There were six of them, all under 18. All had been gang-raped by Ethiopian forces, as a The girls were terrified: they had been told if they sought medical help, they would be killed. “Some didn’t finish basic lab tests,” he told me. “They just went out and disappeared.” Those six were just the beginning. Abraha’s team at Ayder hospital, in the Tigray’s capital Mekelle, would go on to treat thousands, sometimes admitting more than 100 women and girls a week. The , with women set on fire, dismembered, and having metal objects inserted into their reproductive organs. Specialists in sexual violence whom I spoke to during our reporting often said these were the worst cases they had seen. Abraha and his team took significant risks to provide care – continuing despite death threats, and hiding survivors of brutal sexual assaults as armed groups searched for them. Abraha, who became Ayder’s clinical director, steered his staff through the horror, and continues to treat survivors, many of whom have catastrophic, long-term injuries. As cuts to global aid shut many clinics for Tigray’s survivors, Abraha and a team of doctors . He continues to lead a staff who are themselves traumatised – by the war itself, and the cases they treated.

Up until that point the 26-year-old had meticulously prepared for her son’s arrival. She visited her doctor twice a month because the pregnancy was high risk, had regular ultrasounds and took vitamins. “I love the details,” she says. Living on the east side of Gaza City, close to the border with and knowing that being pregnant would make moving fast difficult, she decided to go to her parents in the west of Gaza City that first day. “I thought it was just going to be a few days and I would go back.” 13 times and the house she shared with her husband has been destroyed. In late October, about five weeks before her due date, Al Gherbawi was near a massive Israeli strike on a residential building in City. “It felt like an earthquake,” she remembers. She fled to al-Shifa hospital, where displaced people filled every space. Using a bathroom was nearly impossible. “I can’t forget the horror of that night,” she says. There was a place for unidentified bodies and a barrel for body parts. The strike had reportedly . Al Gherbawi remembers the smell. “I couldn’t take it. I was pregnant. I felt sick … may God have mercy on those who were killed.” Al Gherbawi and her husband decided it was safer to go south to have her baby. In remained a nightmare. She would wake someone to accompany her frequently during the night. Too scared to go into labour naturally, because finding transportation, especially during the night, would be difficult, she asked doctors at Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis to induce her. When the nearby building was struck while she was in labour, she feared panic and chaos could lead to her baby being mixed up with another and asked her mother to keep watch. She describes feeling “fear, unbearable fear”. After Jawad was born, Al Gherbawi moved to a rented flat, sleeping in a room with 30 people. She couldn’t find painkillers for her stitches and quietly endured her pain at night so as not to wake others. She believes she also had postnatal depression. “My face was pale, I was weak, frail and my hair was falling [out].” A few months later, they moved to a tent. “It was the first time that I lived in a tent,” she says bitterly. “The sand, the insects.” She worried constantly that Jawad would be stung. She hugged him at night and woke frequently to check he was still alive: she had heard about newborns freezing to death. Then, when Jawad was nine months old, Al Gherbawi found out she was pregnant again. “At first I was shocked and upset,” she says. “How am I going to bring another child into this world while living in a tent?” brought brief hope. “I can’t describe how happy I was,” she says. Despite being in her first trimester and against everyone’s advice, she insisted on walking back north to her flat. She and her husband spent a cold night sitting on the pavement of the coastal road waiting for the checkpoint to open. Finally, they reached their home, with Jawad’s blue room and the decorations she had hung before the war. They spent six weeks there and started preparing for the delivery. On 18 March, and they had to move again. Their house would later be destroyed. Her pregnancy proved far harder than the one before, with all nine months of it during the war. She says the starvation was the worst. “There would be whole days where all I had was one cucumber.” She worried about her unborn baby and her heart broke watching Jawad cry for food. “ ,” he’d say, his word for food. Whenever there was food, she gave him her share. “There was nothing else I could do.” “The strikes, the lack of safety, the lack of privacy, being in a tent – all of this was hard, but famine was the hardest thing,” she says. “You’d be sleeping and crying because you’re hungry and you can’t find anything to eat.” , with mass civilian casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed, are ‘consistent with the characteristics of genocide’, including ‘using starvation as a method of war’. Closer to her due date, she decided to move back in with her parents, near a hospital with incubators. She asked to be induced as before, but the hospital was overwhelmed with urgent cases and doctors reassured her she could deliver naturally. One night, her contractions started. Not wanting to disturb the others who “did not eat all day” and were sleeping, she called an ambulance before waking her mother. Her husband was in the south. With contractions every five minutes, she walked down five floors. The building had no power for the lift. She delivered a baby boy, Fares, in the ambulance minutes later. Fares weighed just 2kg (4.4lb). Al Gherbawi attributes this to the starvation and says he remains small to this day. At the hospital, there was blood on her bed. The nurse told her there was no anesthesia, they would have to stitch her without it. She says “the pain was unbearable”. The hospital needed the bed. Al Gherbawi, exhausted and in pain, had to sit on a chair until the observation period was over. Finding transportation back to her parents’ flat proved difficult. They finally found a bus that could take them halfway. Five hours after giving birth, Al Gherbawi walked back to her parents’ home and up the five floors.",Hoda Osman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the of those who graduated in medicine in Brazil. Even before receiving her diploma, Adana started fasting, striving to reach her next goal: to become a shaman.

She stood out among hundreds of panellists and sponsors who were talking about business insights, new tech frontiers and standardised buzzwords. Adana, on stage with long feather earrings and rattles made of seeds, gave a powerful talk about the invisibility of Indigenous knowledge, emphasising that scientific research must not usurp Indigenous expertise. Adana Kambeba uses the ancestral knowledge of her people alongside conventional medicine in her work. Photograph: Marizilda Cruppe/the Guardian After Adana returned to Manaus, we had long video calls and exchanged voice messages over several weeks for her profile. I was struck by how she mediates conflicts that arise when doctors don’t respect the healing traditions of Indigenous people, or when Indigenous patients mistrust treatments prescribed by doctors. As an activist, she campaigns for biomedicine to open up to Indigenous knowledge, and not subjugate it. The path has not been easy. At university, Adana faced prejudice and almost had a breakdown. Then she heard a voice that strengthened her resolve: “Something inside me said, ‘This is your mission. Never doubt it.’” For two years, Zhino Babamiri has lived between two wars: one waged by the Islamic Republic, which in Iran, the other within herself. During months of sleepless nights, she weighed up whether speaking about her father might be the very thing that would seal his fate. For families like Zhino’s, the terror is not in speaking to western media, but in what follows: retaliation. I have interviewed several families in Iran who learned their loved ones were hanged at dawn; no final goodbyes or last embrace. More than in Iran this year, according to rights groups, crushing dreams and destroying families. The fear is palpable. Rezgar Beigzadeh Babamiri, a Kurdish political prisoner who was arrested and sentenced to death, with his now-exiled daughter, Zhino Even during our interview, I sensed the terror in Zhino’s voice, but also the determination to save her father. She made it very clear, that silence hadn’t saved him. Each morning, her heart races as she unlocks her phone, bracing for news she is not ready to receive. And still, she wakes up every day ready to continue the fight – not only for her dad, but for other Iranian fathers on death row. Alongside children of fathers facing the same fate, Zhino, 24, co-founded the Daughters of Justice to campaign against the record number of executions in Iran. She refuses to stand back, launching online campaigns and meeting European politicians in an attempt to save lives. Watching her take up this fight in exile, reminds me of the first few days after Mahsa Amini’s death in custody, when I interviewed She has also had to endure the ongoing trauma of reading about torture and the awful conditions her father has had to deal with. All Zhino wants is her father back home; to sit beside him again and rewatch the US sitcom How I Met Your Mother, like they did when she was younger. When I asked her what keeps her going, she told me: “My father used to say, ‘ ’ – resistance is life. Now, I am only doing what he taught me: resisting.” next month as the country goes to the polls. Will president Yoweri Museveni lose his grip on power after four decades of rule? One thing is certain: it won’t be a woman who unseats the octogenarian incumbent because all eight candidates on the ballot are men. This is not because women didn’t put themselves forward. It is because politics remains a boys’ club and women are not welcome. Yvonne Mpambara had first-hand experience of the barriers women face, when she ran as a presidential candidate for the 2026 election. She was one of just three women who gained enough support to be considered for nomination – none made it on to the final ballot. Yvonne Mpambara says the presidency is still associated with traditional masculinity, military credentials and strongman politics.

Men either accused her of sleeping with politicians to get to the top, or propositioned her themselves. Mpambara, 33, described the experience as “one of the most disrespectful periods of my life”. Depressingly, unleashed more abuse. “The misogyny is coming out in full force,” she messaged me shortly after it was published. Men had commented that she should just “learn to take nice compliments”. Yet she refuses to let the abuse derail her. She may not have made the ballot this time but she is fighting back in the most effective way – by setting up a foundation that will nurture future female leaders. She is also in the process of establishing an all-female political party. Mpambara epitomises the notion that gender equality is never a given, it is always fought for. I have no doubt that she is now a role model for many girls and young women who followed her as she offered a new political vision for Uganda, and a future where women are given the same opportunities and respect as men. and start walking towards the one place he might have a chance of getting food for his family – what he called “the American aid” centres.

A still from one of Raed Jamal’s videos of him lying on the ground while bullets pass overhead I spoke to Jamal soon after he posted a video of himself and friends lying on the ground as bullets whizzed overhead. He told me how he had seen people killed while trying to get aid from the Humanitarian Foundation – a US-run militarised aid system that, at the time, had replaced UN distributions. Despite the danger and the times he returned with empty bags, he kept going, because food in the markets was too expensive and this was the only way he could feed his family. “What else can we do? Our life is a struggle,” he told me. Jamal’s struggle to look after his family has continued since a ceasefire was agreed in October. Aid access is better than before but his concern now is how to protect his family from rains that . With little money and unable to return home, he is constantly searching for ways to keep their tent standing and his family warm. Gaza has fallen out of the headlines but hundreds of thousands of ordinary Palestinians like Raed face a third winter of hunger and homelessness.

Yet she knew she had to make as public a stand as possible to rescue her husband. “Everyone knows Uyghurs sent to China will be tortured or die. They [the Chinese government] pushed me to speak out.” At significant risk to her life, she started a personal campaign to raise awareness of Idris’s fate and his imprisonment for helping to promote Uyghur culture and identity. She spoke to journalists, politicians, lawyers and campaigners – all while juggling work as a teacher and a parent. to deport him, rescuing Idris seemed unlikely. Yet her love and support for him, and her belief that she could save him, never wavered as the months and years passed.

Sometimes they just don’t have enough to eat. Gangs can provide all that,” he says, recalling his own motivations to join a crew in 2013, when, aged 13, he arrived in Juba, without his parents, to stay with an uncle. “My problem is that I didn’t go to school,” he says, apologising that his English is not 100%. “I want to build my career as a leader. Right now, I’m leading a lot of people,” he says. “I started with seven kids and now we’re 1,000. It makes me believe that I can stop this issue of gang groups with football.” What impressed me about Akuei is not just that he escaped from a destructive path, but that he has become a respected figure in the same neighbourhood where he joined gangs.

It was why Amira did not tell her mother when she joined a volunteer group that felt like the only thing stopping her country sliding deeper into dystopia. Each morningshe secretly crossed the shifting frontline of Sudan’s North Kordofan state. Amira was entering territory held by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), paramilitaries who have , including genocide, during the country’s cataclysmic war. “I’d never tell anybody, especially my mother, where I was going,” she says. “You have to sneak in and hope you make it back.” Amira’s days were spent counselling women and children who had been raped. When darkness fell, she crept back to land controlled by Sudan’s army. Both sides viewed her with suspicion. “I was constantly interrogated. Every day I would be subjected to questioning. When I’d go to the markets, they’d ask us where I got the money.” It is against this backdrop of fear and mistrust that Sudan, home to the , has conjured up one of the year’s most heartening narratives. Across the vast country, a gigantic grassroots network of ordinary Sudanese people, the (ERRs), is providing life-saving food and medical care to millions of fellow citizens. It is this group that Amira dared not tell her mother she had joined. People in the mutual aid network can become an immediate target for both the RSF and the country’s military, believed to have killed up to 400,000 people between them since the Hardly any of the thousands of volunteers have told friends or family of their work with the ERRs in case they, too, became targets by association. Despite the dangers, the ERR network has grown so large that it has in effect replaced the country’s collapsed state. The network’s ability to care for communities has united a Sudan split in half by , transcending ethnic and regional schisms. The ERRs have become so popular that analysts suggest it is fundamental to any postwar future for Sudan – a rejection of the men with guns who have forced more than 12 million to flee their homes. , and there was genuine surprise among many humanitarians when they did not triumph. Not that the volunteers minded. “We only want to help,” says one, Jamal. But providing help is increasingly fraught. Volunteers are hunted down; many are apprehended and detained. Some disappear; others are tortured, or executed. More than least 145 of them are believed to have been killed. How many have been arrested or disappeared is unclear: vast swathes of Sudan have no connectivity, meaning there is no way to document war crimes. Another volunteer, Alsanosi Adam, from central Sudan, tells the Guardian: “You risk anything from intimidation to death. From torture to being killed – and anything in between.” Like many others, Adam has lost close friends who were persecuted for simply helping the ERRs. “A friend from South Kordofan was detained, imprisoned and tortured. He eventually died because of the torture he received in prison.” About 100 volunteers are detained in Shala prison in El Fasher, the city by the RSF amid a wave of atrocities. Samir says: “If you’re a humanitarian in Sudan now, it is very dangerous. Neutrality, being impartial, is dangerous. Each side thinks you should swear allegiance to them.” He adds that volunteers are routinely beaten after being accused of “political affiliation” by the RSF. As he speaks, Amira, Alsanosi and Jamal nod in unison. They are sitting in the London offices of the Guardian – 3,000 miles from those who might want them dead – yet their fear is palpable. They arrived in the UK under a veil of secrecy, a trip arranged by the to show solidarity with Sudan’s humanitarian volunteers. During the trip they briefed the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, who later of the “incredibly brave Sudanese volunteers” she met. A Foreign Office spokesperson says: “Emergency Response Rooms are risking everything to deliver life-saving aid where no one else can reach – their service to humanity is extraordinary.” The secrecy of the trip underscores the perils they face. Only Adam agreed to be pictured. Faced with such risks, it might be assumed that volunteer numbers are sluggish. Yet even as the violence spreads, they increase daily. To date 26,000 volunteers have stepped forward to provide support in a country where people are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity and seven million face famine. Most are young and 40% are women, despite the Amira accepts that she faces a heightened risk of being attacked but says that when she learned that rape survivors were receiving no support she had to act. “There was a need to do something. They had nothing.” Those with nothing in Sudan can be counted in the millions. Traditional as the war has worsened. International humanitarian agencies struggle to reach many areas, leaving local ERR groups as the only solution. Volunteers are active in 96 of 118 districts across Sudan. More than 29 million Sudanese people – more than half the population – have received meals or help from ERRs. But their effectiveness has amplified the dangers volunteers face. Both the RSF and the military appear increasingly envious of the trust in communities accrued by the ERRs. “They know we have a direct link and much influence within our communities,” says Samir. “Therefore, they are slightly fearful of our activities.” Jamal says such distrust can quickly tip into violence. He was distributing food to starving civilians in South Kordofan when he was arrested, then tortured. “I was beaten and confined to a very small room which wasn’t well ventilated at all. They were accusing me of collaborating with outside forces,” he says. Yet while the community’s support can heighten the threat, more often it serves as a life-saver. Jamal thinks he would still be detained – or dead – if local residents had not rallied to protest over his arrest. “Most of the protection we get actually emanates from the community itself. When I was arrested, it was the massive community mobilisation that ensured my release.” Despite such support and despite propping up much of the country, the future of the ERRs is far from guaranteed. Funding is tight – they operate at a deficit of 77%, forcing them to scale down critical life-saving support. They have received less than 1% of all international aid funding for Sudan despite being able to deliver aid at a fraction of the cost of UN agencies. this year, that derisory amount was reduced even more. Hundreds of their community soup kitchens were forced to close. At the time of writing, the ERRs have enough money to operate several months into next year. “It’s not enough,” says Jamal. But the cash they do have goes far. “Money is targeted to areas considered most at need. They specify the location and then ask for the funds – it’s direct,” explains Samir. Adam confirms that, during their visit to the UK, Cooper has pledged to give them direct funding. The Foreign Office spokesperson says the UK is “proud to support their vital work” and has provided £146m in aid to Sudan, including money for groups supporting the ERRs. Another Nobel nomination in 2026 feels probable, though Jamal says that such global acknowledgment is not about the acclaim, but personal safety. “For me, the Nobel prize is a protection measure. Winning it would contribute to the volunteers gaining more protection,” he says. Amira ultimately decided she could not wait for the to afford her extra security. After a year of furtive trips across the frontline, she told her family. “I started being more open with my mother about what I was really doing. To my relief, she was 100% supportive,” Amira says. “She could not be more proud.”",Mark Townsend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/16/labour-employment-rights-bill-law-house-of-lords,Labour’s employment rights bill set to become law after Lords battle,2025-12-16T19:58:38.000Z,"Unions hail ‘generational shift’ as legislation introduces new rights on sick pay, parental leave and zero-hours contracts Labour’s employment rights bill will finally become law after a battle in the House of Lords, paving the way for significant new rights for workers on sick pay, parental leave and zero-hours contracts. Trade unions hailed a “generational shift” for workers’ rights after Tory peers conceded at the 11th hour on the legislation, which the government had promised to pass by Christmas. Royal assent is expected by Thursday. The struggle to pass the law, which faced significant opposition from the Conservatives and business groups, meant the government made a number of concessions to secure its passage. Trade unions agreed earlier this month to remove day-one rights to unfair dismissal from the package of reforms, in return for the lifting of the compensation cap, to get the bill through parliament in time to start implementing new rights from April. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, said: “This landmark legislation, now soon to be in law, will drag Britain’s outdated employment laws into the 21st century and offer dignity and respect to millions more in the workplace.” The bill will introduce rights to guaranteed hours and payment for short-notice cancellation of shifts, bar fire-and-rehire practices in most circumstances, grant paternity and parental leave from day one, and strengthen workplace trade union rights. The day-one right to protection against unfair dismissal has been removed as a concession to business and replaced with a shortened qualifying period of six months, down from two years. The process of passing the bill – which contains key manifesto pledges – has renewed anger among a significant number of MPs and ministers towards the House of Lords, after repeated obstructions from Conservative and crossbench peers. The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “This is a historic day and early Christmas present for working people across the country, and the trade unions who represent them. “Unions and workers have long campaigned for these vital rights. Together, we have broken a decades-long economic status quo defined by insecurity, weak rights and poor pay. Finally, working people will enjoy more security, better pay and dignity at work thanks to this bill. “It’s now vital that workers start feeling the benefits of this legislation in their lives as soon as possible. That means the legislation must be implemented in full, and at speed – with watertight secondary legislation to ensure there are no loopholes for bad bosses to exploit.” Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, said women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and young people stood to gain most from changes to unfair dismissal, zero-hours contracts and day-one rights. He said there were still obstacles ahead as the government devised codes of practice and secondary legislation. “It’s vital that as government works with employers and unions to shape these, the reforms deliver on the spirit of the bill as originally intended,” Harrison added. The Conservatives said the bill would fuel already rising unemployment. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: “It will pile costs on to small businesses, freeze hiring, and ultimately leave young people and jobseekers paying the price for Labour’s capitulation to their union paymasters. “The Conservatives will scrap the most disastrous elements of this bill and get Britain working again.”",Jessica Elgot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/23/dr-christian-happi-virus-detection-pandemic-sentinel-pardis-sabeti,Meet Dr Happi. With $100m and a steely determination could he save the world from the next pandemic?,2025-12-23T06:00:50.000Z,"The Cameroonian professor made the Time most influential list in 2025 and saw the project he co-founded receive $100m for its virus detection work. Now he is on a mission to transform Africa’s genomics capability inning the world’s health lottery is a lonely business in the current climate. “It’s like being an orphan in a space where there used to be many kids playing – suddenly everybody’s gone and you’re just there with a ball,” says Dr Christian Happi. The Cameroonian distinguished professor of molecular biology and genomics has just won $100m for his work – at a time when global health funding is being viciously slashed as part of wider “It gets very lonely when you have this type of resource, and then around you, your colleagues have nothing to do, don’t have resources to work and are closing down labs,” says the 57-year-old from his office at Redeemer’s University in Ede, Awarded every four years by the US to an initiative “that promises real and measurable progress in solving a critical problem of our time”, the grant honours Happi and his co-founder, computational geneticist Dr Pardis Sabeti, who have already saved an uncountable number of lives. Together they have helped identify, and therefore stem, potentially disastrous outbreaks of yellow fever in Nigeria, mpox in Sierra Leone and Marburg virus in Rwanda. Few people have heard of Happi and Sabeti, yet they not only run a but are also breaking down inequity between Africa and the global north by empowering African scientists to improve African lives. Their project, Sentinel, is an early warning framework co-created by Nigeria’s Institute of Genomics and Global Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Housed inside the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), the programme uses genomics, surveillance and sequencing technology to identify new pathogens and then packages the science so it is ready-made for governments to act on. Since its inception, Sentinel – initially funded by a TED-Audacious Project grant – has proved an extraordinarily effective idea, says its managing director, Dr Al Ozonoff. While Happi’s work responding to critical outbreaks has saved lives, just as important, Ozonoff believes, is his “vision of African scientists working at the cutting edge of their fields to improve life for everyday Africans”. Sentinel has trained more than 3,000 health professionals across 53 of Africa’s 54 countries in genomics so they too are better able to track, identify and respond to outbreaks. In light of global aid cuts, Happi had been worried about Sentinel’s survival. Development assistance for health is estimated to drop to $39.1bn by the end of 2025 as the US, UK and other countries reduce their overseas development funding. The MacArthur grant will allow Sentinel to train more academics and health professionals in harder to reach places. Happi, who starts each day with a prayer and a walk, recalls the first time he put the idea behind Sentinel to good use. It was 2014 and he got the middle-of-the-night phone call that, he says, “you never want to receive”. It was Nigeria’s ministry of health. There was a suspected case of in Lagos. Could he confirm it? “I got chills, goose pimples. I prayed that wasn’t going to be the case,” he says. Happi drove to his rudimentary, at the time, two-room laboratory on Redeemer’s University campus, where he remains a professor, and said goodbye to his wife, Dr Anise Happi, deputy director of zoonotic research and surveillance at ACEGID. Ebola, which within two years would kill more than 11,325 people in west Africa, had already claimed the lives of many healthcare workers. He did not know if he would see Anise or their three children again. “She told me: ‘I will pray for you. I know you’ll be back,’” Happi recalls. Working through the heat of the night, sodden in their own sweat and exposed to the deadly infection they were testing, Happi and his assistant were able to confirm within a matter of hours that Ebola had arrived in Nigeria. The country mobilised. Just 42 days later, Nigeria was able to declar itself . Out of the confirmed 20 cases, eight people died. Each death a tragedy, but nothing like the scale that could have faced the country of 186 million people. This demonstrated for the first time that Sentinel was “a transformational system”, says Happi, explaining that its speed and effectiveness helped to mobilise a response swiftly. From there, the idea – detection of pathogenic threats in real time while stopping diseases before they spread – grew. Build Health International (BHI), a non-profit that builds infrastructure in low-resource settings, upgraded Happi and Sabeti’s little lab to a state-of-the-art genomics centre – this time with air conditioning – and by 2020, when Covid hit, the team was well equipped to have the full genome within 48 hours of the first case arriving in Nigeria. Sentinel later detected the Beta and Omicron variants. It wasn’t always easy. Trying to build a genomics centre in rural Nigeria where energy supplies aren’t stable and equipment is costly to import was tough, says Jim Ansara, co-founder of BHI. But Happi was “always pushing”, steadfast in his belief that Africa shouldn’t have to settle for less than the global north, Ansara says. “He’s quite unusual because he is very entrepreneurial, very driven and almost impatient for results.” Born the fourth of eight children in Sangmélima, Cameroon, Happi went to Yaoundé University, Cameroon, then studied in Nigeria and the US. He was described as a “force of nature” when he was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2025. “I don’t even subscribe to Time,” Happi laughs. When it came to the MacArthur grant, however, a competition that involved an application process, the team knew they were one of five finalists, but winning in November still came as a surprise. “My heartbeat accelerated so much that I couldn’t open my mouth. It was a shock,” he says. “I never dreamed that in my career I would have this kind of money at once.” When Happi called Ansara, his words were simple: “Get ready,” says Ansara – a nod to the infrastructure that may be needed as part of Sentinel’s mission to train more scientists and embed pandemic preparedness in public health systems. “We are not going to be judged by just the fact that we got this money but [for] what we do with this money,” says Happi, who says it is time to put “500%” into the work. He and Sabeti have undoubtedly saved thousands of lives but he remains humble and focused on the lives still to save. The grant “will be foundational in sustaining [Happi’s] efforts to develop genomics capability on the African continent and to use that in the detection and prevention of infectious diseases,” says Dyann Wirth, professor at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health where Happi is an adjunct professor of infectious diseases. But Sentinel will still be dampened by the wider effects of global aid cuts, Happi says: “In order to tie a parcel you need many hands.” Emerging diseases are that parcel, and with reduced funding, the hands are falling away. The Sentinel team, he says, will therefore be looking to collaborate with other organisations as part of its expansion. He has already, says Ansara, surrounded himself with young Africans committed to this work, helping to “break apart the legacy of colonialism and aid from the global north”. With $100m in the mission’s pocket, Happi is infused with a sense of urgency, although he has promised his family he’ll take a break over Christmas and put away what the other Dr Happi, his partner Anise, calls “his second wife”, AKA his laptop. “I promised them I am going to just make them a priority,” says Happi. “I’ll do exactly that.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/16/trauma-storm-hurricane-melissa-emotional-devastation-mental-health-ptsd-jamaica,The trauma after the storm: Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of emotional devastation across Jamaica,2025-12-16T14:00:06.000Z,"Experts are calling for the integration of mental health into climate-disaster policy in the Caribbean as studies show that PTSD risks increase after hurricanes and displacement on 28 October with 185mph winds, destroying homes, hospitals and infrastructure, , Toni-Jan Ifill immediately realised it would leave many with long-term traumatic memories. A month and a half after the storm, which also affected , the clinical psychologist says recollections of the terrifying winds also haunt some of the staff at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston. Even the sound of rain can cause trauma responses among people who lived through it. “Simple things can trigger them,” Ifill says. “One woman mentioned a trolley we often push through the corridors, carrying bedding and other items, whose sound reminded her of cracking branches and the wind. She no longer wants to hear that sound.” Hurricane Melissa, a category 5 storm, led to a over three years and an additional $150m (£112m) payout from Jamaica’s pioneering for reconstruction, partially covering the estimated . But the financial relief, experts warn, cannot cover the unseen cost: the widespread trauma – especially among those still recovering from While most attention focuses on physical reconstruction, studies over the past three years show that (PTSD) risks increase after hurricanes and displacement. Experts are calling for the integration of mental health into climate-disaster policy across Researchers emphasise how extended displacement, loss of livelihoods and inadequate services worsen mental health risks. A 2023 Caribbean-focused paper warned of , depression and anxiety after climate-related events. A qualitative study in Dominica this year also and emotional distress among people displaced by Tropical Storm Erika and Hurricane Maria. Dr Eamin Heanoy, a researcher at the University of Alberta, studied disaster survivors across a broad range of countries, including Mexico, India, Canada, Bangladesh, Germany, the US and Indonesia. Her , published last year in the journal Healthcare, says that survivors could face three mental health challenges after a natural disaster: PTSD, depression and anxiety. Dr Rose-Ann Smith, a lecturer in geography and disaster risk management at the University of the West Indies in , agrees with this assessment. She notes that humans are generally resilient, but as the climate crisis worsens, mental health is becoming an increasingly significant issue – although prevalence surveys are lacking. Smith and Heanoy found that women reported higher mental distress than men. “So it’s quite possible women are more psychologically vulnerable than males [in such catastrophes],” Smith says. Heanoy says that while some initial improvement in mental health occurs within a year, long-term outcomes remain uncertain. Whether or to what extent disaster survivors who experience mental challenges recover will depend to a large extent on what triggered their illness. The experts observe that during and in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, loss of homes and resources can intensify the mental struggle to rebuild. Smith calls housing loss “one of the primary stressors”, particularly when insurance or savings are lacking. “Rebuilding comes with its own mental burden,” she says. Ifill observes the same among her patients: “People who had mental health challenges before have noticed it’s significantly worse in this short period of time.” Hurricane Melissa destroyed two of Jamaica’s most prominent river water intakes, delaying the complete restoration of water supplies. Even if the catastrophe bond payout provides some relief, it cannot resolve all of Jamaica’s infrastructure problems in the aftermath. And, as experts highlight, rebuilding alone cannot heal emotional wounds caused by permanent disabilities or the loss of loved ones. Heanoy reports that survivors consistently find community support to be more responsive than government assistance. Smith observes that communal ties strengthen resilience. “The government’s role is essential,” Smith says. “In its absence, or when it is slow, communities keep each other whole.” In times of disaster, Ifill says, mutual support from communities helps overcome challenges. She says she was “impressed by the sense of humour and relaxed manner” among strong communities in Jamaica. “Your house is gone, right? But if a community has more jovial people, they make jokes about the storm.” Ifill also praises Jamaica’s government for encouraging citizens to look after their mental health after Melissa, but warns about the harms of doomscrolling. “I recommended [staff] limit social media, stick to reliable news, and use WhatsApp to connect with family.” ental health has garnered greater attention from international agencies over the past decade because of the climate crisis, as scientists have realised that the frequency of hurricanes and other extreme weather events in 2011 to guide field workers when dealing with survivors of traumatic events. The Pan American Health Organization (Paho) has also published guidelines, with documents released in on psychological coping strategies and psychosocial support in response to natural disasters in the region. has also taken steps to help deal with such psychological trauma. Its president, Daniel Best, says that feedback from communities and staff members on the ground led the bank to initiate a psychosocial support programme in 2018 in conjunction with Paho. The project was designed to build individual and social resilience in the event of a disaster by training mental health professionals, creating a regional expert roster for emergency response, combating stigma and encouraging the use of mental health services. Mental health needs assessment and action plans for care and psychosocial support, Best says, adding that all of the bank’s borrowing member states can benefit from that project. Support from international organisations is crucial, as mental health is often not the top priority in governments’ responses to climate disasters. Experts such as Heanoy say that when survivors cannot rebuild or restore their pre-disaster lives, research shows that the trauma could persist, reducing the chances of full recovery. Kieron Chaboo, a farmer from Orange Grove, Trinidad and Tobago, who lost all the crops on his 30-acre (12-hectare) farm during massive floods in 2018, highlights the crucial role of financial resources in safeguarding mental health. He says he has always saved money with flood loss in mind, as he does not rely on government assistance to rebuild his life. Seven years after the disaster, he feels frustrated as he has yet to hear from officials responsible for compensating farmers for their losses. “They came and did their investigation,” he says. “But up to this day, we never got compensation.” Best notes that the region accounts for less than but bears disproportionate climate impacts, and says that a swift, well-funded recovery is critical to prevent such prolonged suffering. “Our reality and our infrastructure do not match the climate conditions that we are facing. Attempting to rebuild an entire country to make it climate resilient is going to take time,” he says, adding that winds of 185mph (300km/h), as experienced in Jamaica, will inevitably cause significant destruction.

She was busy treating patients, including an elderly woman who needed a blood transfusion, when the attack began. “They killed six wounded soldiers and civilians in their beds – some of them women,” she says. “I don’t know what happened to my other patients. I had to run when they stormed the hospital.” Khalil, 27, was shot in the right foot and thigh as RSF fighters took control of the nearby military headquarters. She fled the city and walked for a day, injured and without food, to reach the town of Garney. “On the way, they took my phone and money. I was left with nothing,” she says. More than 1,000 people – including women and children – walked for two days to reach the town of Tawila in North after fleeing El Fasher, which was captured after an 18-month siege. Tawila, about 34 miles (55km) west of El Fasher, is under the control of the Liberation Army faction led by Abdul Wahid Mohamed al-Nur (SLA-AW). On Tuesday, the Joint Forces – who are allied with Sudan’s army – accused the RSF of killing more than since the fall of the city. The UN said there were videos showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters”. in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly. On one side are the Sudanese armed forces, who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlord The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called the , which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. The conflict has plunged Sudan into , according to UN officials. It has created the , scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan. According to witnesses, thousands more civilians remain trapped by the RSF and allied militias in Garney, south-west of El Fasher. Many are former soldiers from the Sudanese army, the Joint Forces and other armed groups that had been fighting alongside the army. They are reportedly being held because they cannot afford ransom demands of between 5m and 10m Sudanese pounds (£6,000 to £12,000), according to survivors who made it to Tawila. Those unable to pay have been detained for days, and in some cases released only after becoming gravely ill. The SLA-AW has reportedly allowed government troops fleeing El Fasher to enter Tawila on condition they surrender their weapons. Adam Yagoub, 28, a driver from Sennar in central Sudan, narrowly escaped being killed after being captured by three militiamen on camels near Garney. “They wanted to cut my head off with a knife,” he tells the Guardian, showing his arm, which one of the fighters hit with the butt of an AK-47 rifle. “Then one of them recognised me – his brother had worked with me – and begged them not to kill me. We were 18 people who left El Fasher together, but only eight made it to Tawila. I think the others are dead.” Yagoub says he saw 22 bodies near what he called a “fake well” used by the RSF and allied militias between Garney and Tawila. “It’s a trap,” he says. “People walk all day without water, and when they reach it, the militias are waiting. They killed 22 men there and took the bodies away to hide them.” Another nurse who escaped El Fasher South hospital after the attack on Sunday said RSF fighters entered through one gate and opened fire on patients in the emergency ward, killing at least eight. “We fled through another gate, but they hit me on the head with a rifle,” he says. In a video statement on Wednesday, the head of the RSF, , known as Hemedti, said that any soldier or officer who had “violated the right of any person” would be held accountable. Many of those who escaped El Fasher spent hours hiding near the army’s artillery unit before fleeing west under cover of darkness. Already displaced families from the city’s Abu Shouk camp were forced to move again, seeking refuge in the Daraja Oula neighbourhood before eventually heading for Tawila. Those captured by the RSF in Garney were reportedly given water mixed with flour to revive them after they had walked for a day without supplies. Survivors said people were then separated by gender and perceived affiliation: men suspected of being fighters were detained, while some civilians were released or freed after paying ransoms. The SLA-AW has deployed additional fighters around Tawila “to protect those fleeing El Fasher and to prevent clashes if the RSF pursues armed groups who have retreated with their weapons”, a local commander said. It is understood that elements of the Sudanese army and allied groups continue to resist in the Jebel Wana area, north-west of El Fasher, after losing control of the city. Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF) says it is facing a large influx of people to its clinic in Tawila hospital. “More than 1,000 people arrived [from El Fasher] at night on foot and in trucks, after an extremely dangerous journey. Many were in a state of great weakness suffering from malnutrition and dehydration,” says MSF project coordinator Sylvain Penicaud.",Zeinab Mohammed Salih,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women work longer and earn just a third – 32% – of what men get per hour, when paid and unpaid labour, such as domestic work, are taken into account. Even when unpaid domestic labour is not included, women only earn 61% of what men make, Those aged 15 to 64 work 10 hours more a week, on average, than men. They earned just over a quarter (about 28%) in 2025 of total income around the world, a share that has barely shifted over the past 35 years. The report, prefaced by leading economists Jayati Ghosh and Joseph Stiglitz, reveals that the richest 10% of the global population own close to three-quarters of all wealth, while the poorest half hold barely 2%, and looks at how inequality affects every aspect of people’s lives. When it comes to gender, it noted that despite decades of anti-discrimination laws and advocacy, equality remains a distant dream. “It’s not surprising,” says Chu, who adds that gender inequality has continued to be entrenched in recent years with “the backsliding of democratic institutions and threats to women’s rights”. Women work more hours than men everywhere, according to the report. The largest gaps in working hours are between 12 to 13 a week in the Middle East and north Africa, east Asia, and south and south-east Asia. The smallest gaps of six to seven hours a week were seen in Europe, North America and Oceania. Women are employed less than men across all regions of the world. Structural barriers such as access to affordable childcare, transport and family leave policies hinder women’s ability to enter and remain in employment, says the report. In south and south-east Asia, the Middle East and north Africa about one in three women of working age is employed, compared with more than two-thirds of men. Other regions, including Europe and North America, have higher female employment rates, yet the gap is still significant. Meanwhile, across all regions of the world, women consistently earn less than employed men. The gender pay gap is “an undeniable global phenomenon that persists in the present”, adds the report. Aatif Somji, a senior research officer in gender equality and social inclusion at the thinktank ODI global, says the gender pay gap is “profoundly unfair” and that there has been “so little progress because unpaid care work still largely falls on women’s shoulders”. He adds that although these “invisible tasks sustain society”, they are still coded as “women’s work”. “This often makes it impossible for women to compete on an equal footing with men in the paid workforce, as they take up lower quality, lower-paying jobs of part-time work to balance their care responsibilities – or are kept out of better-paying jobs because of deep-rooted gender norms and stereotypes,” he says. While some progress has been made, says Chu, including improvements around women’s labour rights and legislation relating to equal pay, change still needs to happen. “The patriarchy runs deep,” she says. “It is embedded in institutions and economic systems. It spans from the household to government, to international organisations.”",Sarah Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the final death toll of the massacre remains unclear, British MPs have been briefed that Sarah Champion, chair of the Commons international development select committee, said: “Members received a private briefing on Sudan, at which one of the academics stated: ‘Our low estimate is 60,000 people have been killed there in the last three weeks.’” As many as 150,000 residents of El Fasher remain unaccounted for since the city fell to the RSF. They are not thought to have left the city, and this grisly development comes amid increasingly gloomy speculation about their fate. , which has been closely analysing satellite images of El Fasher, said the city was eerily empty, with once-bustling markets now desolate. Yale’s latest analysis suggests marketplaces are now that they are becoming overgrown and that all the livestock appears to have been moved out of the city,which had 1.5 million inhabitants before the war began in April 2023. “It’s beginning to look a lot like a slaughterhouse,” said Raymond. No expert or agency has been able to explain the whereabouts of the tens of thousands of residents who have been missing since El Fasher – the army’s last major stronghold in the region – was overrun on 26 October after the RSF’s brutal The Guardian has spoken to sources who describe El Fasher residents being held in detention centres in the city, though the numbers still detained are small. RSF officials had pledged to allow the UN into El Fasher to deliver aid and investigate atrocities, but to date the city remains out of bounds for humanitarian organisations as well as UN officials. Aid convoys are understood to be on standby in nearby towns and cities as negotiations for the RSF to give safety guarantees continue. So far the paramilitary group, now in its third year of civil war with Sudan’s armed forces, has refused. A UN source said: “There needs to be a security assessment before we can plan on sending assistance. Right now, there is no guarantee of safe passage or protection of civilians, aid workers or humanitarian assets.” Despite the uncertainty over how many residents might be alive inside El Fasher, the need for help to reach the city is deemed critical, with reported among those who had escaped. International experts have Raymond said some residents, with whom his team had now lost touch, had contacted them within the first two days of the attack alleging that up to 10,000 people had been killed.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/25/reparations-caribbean-africa-britain-restorative-justice-slavery,In the Caribbean and Africa a reparations movement is growing: so why is Britain pretending otherwise?,2025-12-25T15:00:44.000Z,"This year was a pivotal one, in which the issue of restorative justice began to frame the UK’s post-imperial relationship with the global south little while ago, I was interviewed for a forthcoming book about reparations by a black British comedian and his co-writer. I approached it with modest expectations. It is a serious subject for me as a man, and I wondered whether the complexity might be flattened or trivialised in the process. I got to read the book this week. In , Lenny Henry and Marcus Ryder take a complex, controversial and deeply contested subject and do something both rare and necessary: they break it down into its constituent parts and explain – debunking and demystifying along the way – why so many of the stock objections to reparations are intellectually incoherent, historically illiterate or politically evasive. They manage this without sacrificing rigour or warmth, weaving careful analysis with Henry’s trademark humour, a red pea soup recipe and even a short play – reminding the reader that moral seriousness and creative generosity are not mutually exclusive. As 2025 draws to a close, the book has landed at a moment when the subject of reparations, long treated as a fringe or rhetorical issue in Europe, has caught fire elsewhere. It is difficult to deny that this has been a pivotal year for the global reparations movement – not because any consensus has been reached, but because the question itself has been mobilised. On one side, Caribbean states, African governments and diaspora movements are consolidating claims. On the other, Britain continues to blithely bat the issue away. The gap between the two positions is now the story. In November, the Caricom Reparations Commission, led by Sir Hilary Beckles, visited the UK. The delegation met civil society groups, academics, churches, activists and some parliamentarians. The reception at Westminster was distinctly underwhelming. There were no senior ministers available, no commitment to talks and no indication that reparations would be treated as a live policy question by the British government. It would be easy to read this as a snub – and many in the Caribbean do. But it is important to recognise what the visit achieved: dialogue was opened; reparations were discussed not as an abstract moral plea but as a concrete political claim rooted in law, economics and history. Even limited access helped mobilise the call. Silence, after all, is not the same as stasis. When asked previously about reparations, Keir Starmer made it clear that his government would not be drawn into what he described as “ ”. The prime minister’s phrasing matters. It frames reparations as indulgent and backward-looking rather than as a claim arising from the foundations of the modern British state. This is precisely the framing that The Big Payback examines. Henry and Ryder insist reparations are not about guilt or inherited blame, but about historical responsibility and contemporary advantage. was not an unfortunate moral aberration. It was an economic system that financially catapulted Britain’s rise and shaped its institutions but left enduring inequalities in its wake throughout the global south. Inequalities that still exist today manifesting within a broader spectrum of racism. To deny reparations is to deny historical causality. The tired refrain that “no one alive today owned slaves” is beside the point when states, corporations, financial institutions and landed estates persist as legal and economic entities that directly benefited from enslavement. The claim that reparations would be too complex collapses under the weight of historical precedents – from Holocaust reparations to post-colonial compensation schemes – while the fear that reparations would be socially destabilising is exposed as a projection rooted more in political discomfort than empirical evidence. Reparations cannot remain an emotional argument and are not a single cheque, but a long-term process aimed at repairing systems as much as compensating people. At last there are signs of the issue being taken seriously, with some looking at how reparations might work: through investment in education and health, institutional reform, wealth-building mechanisms, cultural repair and apologies backed by material commitments. The African Union (AU) declared 2025 to be the , putting the issue at the centre of its collective agenda for the first time. Leaders, civil society organisations and diaspora movements came together to affirm that this was not a symbolic demand, but a matter of justice, dignity and development. African leaders quickly recognised that one year was not enough. In July 2025, the AU formally endorsed 2026–36 as the . This 10-year commitment builds on decades of intellectual and political groundwork – from the , to the Accra declarations of Over the next decade, the AU has committed to mobilising global support, working with civil society and the diaspora, promoting education and research and developing policies around the lasting impacts of slavery, colonialism and exploitation. In this context, Britain’s insistence on “moving forward” begins to look out of step. While Africa and the Caribbean are institutionalising reparations as a development and justice agenda, the former colonial metropoles remain stuck at the level of avoidance. The result is an asymmetry: one side is building frameworks while the other is offering silence. This asymmetry is reinforced by the hollowing out of the Commonwealth itself. Once imagined as a forum for post-colonial dialogue and shared responsibility, it now struggles to even define post-colonial relations. That the issue of reparations has not secured a place on the Commonwealth agenda speaks volumes about the institution’s limits when confronted with issues that challenge historical power hierarchies. Immigration policy further exposes these contradictions. In recent years, the UK and parts of Europe – taking cues from the hardening of immigration regimes in the US – have allowed increasingly punitive approaches to migration, disproportionately affecting African, Caribbean and Latin American countries. The rise of far-right politics has helped push immigration policy towards restriction and deterrence, fostering division at home while eroding the moral language of partnership and shared history that once underpinned relations with former colonies. Many African and Caribbean countries continue to face stringent UK visa requirements despite shared histories and Commonwealth ties. This feels like a bitter irony: descendants of enslaved and colonised peoples encounter fortress borders from the very state that once claimed unrestricted access to their lands, labour and resources. Set against the disgraceful unresolved legacy of the Windrush scandal, visa restrictions deepen the sense that Britain’s post-imperial relationship with the Caribbean and Africa is increasingly transactional. None of this means reparations are inevitable, or that agreement is imminent. The UK and Europe’s concerns – about fiscal precedent, political backlash and legal exposure – are real and will shape how the debate unfolds. But what 2025 has made clear is that reparations are no longer a marginal or episodic demand. They are being organised, internationalised and normalised as part of a broader reckoning with slavery, colonialism and global inequality. The Caricom visit, the African Union’s Decade of Reparations and the growing alignment between Caribbean, African and diaspora voices all point in the same direction. Reparations or restorative justice, as The Big Payback makes clear, are not about dwelling in the past. They are about deciding what kind of future relationship Britain, as a former colonial power, is willing to create – one built on selective memory and managed silence, or one grounded in truth, repair and a willingness to confront the foundations on which modern Britain still stands. Britain’s leaders say they want to look forward. The Caribbean and Africa are asking a more honest question: forward from where, and on whose terms?",Kenneth Mohammed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK also announced earlier this year that it would be , but has been accused of for that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m). “It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.” , a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.

Anita Kattakuzhy, director of policy at , a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors. “Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy. “Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse Among the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as a in the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than this year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months and The cutting of development funding by will directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/09/what-is-gender-apartheid-activists-international-law-women-girls-rights-afghanistan-iran,What is gender apartheid – and can anything be done to stop it?,2024-10-09T08:00:09.000Z,"Activists hope a change in international law could help to address the intensifying erosion of women and girls’ rights in Afghanistan Over the past three years, the world has watched in horror as women and girls in have had their rights and freedoms systematically stripped away. In the face of inaction by the international community, a campaign for the conditions being imposed on Afghan and Iranian women to be made a crime under international law as gender apartheid was launched last year. What does the term mean and will it make a difference? Gender apartheid is a term used to describe the systemic oppression, discrimination and segregation of a specific group based on gender. as “inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them”. Racial apartheid, which comes from the Afrikaans word for “separateness”, under international law in 1973 in response to the segregation and subjugation of black South Africans by the white ruling class in South Africa since 1948, and which continued until 1994. Women’s rights activists, UN experts and lawyers argue that if you replace the word “racial” with “gender”, it becomes an accurate reflection of the condition of tens of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran. At the end of 2023, a campaign called was launched by Afghan human rights activists, backed by United Nations experts, calling for gender apartheid in Afghanistan to be codified as a crime against humanity by the U The campaign argues that current laws do not reflect the intent, ideology and institutionalised nature of the systemic subjugation and deprivation of women in Afghanistan , where laws have been specifically crafted to constrain the lives of women and their role in society. Women and their status and rights have been pivotal to the Taliban’s governance of Afghanistan since it swept to power in August 2021, after the withdrawal of US and UK troops and the collapse of the democratic Afghan government. In the past three years, the group has issued more than curtailing the rights of all Afghanistan’s women and girls. and university, banned women from almost every form of paid employment, prevented them from and blocked their access to the legal system. In August, they published a new set of “ , which banned women from speaking in public, deeming their voices an “intimate” part of their bodies, and made it mandatory for women to cover every part of their body in thick cloth in public. It also made it illegal for women to look at a man who is not a relation. The Taliban have also brought back flogging and the and public execution of women for offences such as adultery. Some human rights activists are also arguing that the term gender apartheid should also be applied to what is happening to women in Iran. They argue that Iran’s new “hijab and chastity” bill imposes harsh penalties, including prison sentences of up to 10 years, on women who do not conform to a mandated dress code and head covering in public. It also increases the surveillance of women and girls by the government to ensure they are conforming to the hijab regulations, using and government-mandated “hijab watchers” and imposes more gender segregation in public spaces. An aggressive enforcement crackdown by the Iranian regime has seen and imprisoned after being deemed to be in breach of strict hijab laws The UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran has called the law , and said “authorities appear to be governing through systemic discrimination with the intention of suppressing women and girls into total submission” However, others argue that the situation for women in Iran is not comparable to the plight of women in Afghanistan and while the Iranian authorities are undeniably imposing human rights abuses and severe gender discrimination on women and girls, it does not equate to gender apartheid. Those calling for gender apartheid to be recognised as a crime against humanity argue that the international community responded to racial apartheid in South Africa after it became a crime in 1973,eventually forcing the government to back down. If gender apartheid was codified as a crime and applied to Afghanistan or Iran, states would theoretically be obliged to take action, to uphold the integrity of international laws. It would also increase pressure on countries to grant asylum to Afghan and Iranian women and girls and hopefully stop states from accepting the legitimacy of Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan and pursuing trade and diplomatic relations with them. In September, Canada, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands said it was planning to take the to the international court of justice (ICJ) for gender discrimination, which could strengthen the calls to codify gender apartheid under international law. However, others argue that making gender apartheid a crime would have limited impact. When it comes to Afghanistan, while activists push for sanctions and isolation of the Taliban, the international community has largely followed a policy of conditional engagement and there are signs that countries in the region are slowly building diplomatic bridges with the regime. So far, no condemnation, sanctions or pressure from the international community has had any impact on the Taliban or the relentless oppression of women and girls in Iran and there is no prospect of governments engaging militarily in Afghanistan or Iran to protect their rights. earlier this year: “Nobody is coming to help us.”",Annie Kelly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was only the – four more have joined her since. Even now, with 100 operations under her belt, the reality of working in a role in which she confronts misogyny and discrimination daily has not dented Kanyepi’s love of the surgical theatre. In South Africa, where she trained as a heart surgeon, she had been among other women medics , but when she returned home to , she joined a tiny group of just four other cardiothoracic surgeons in the country, all of whom were male. “I was first treated with scepticism,” she says. “Misogyny was not always said outright, but people had doubts. Everything was about proving myself again.” Kanyepi grew up in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, and says she was lucky that her mother was able to send her to some of the city’s best schools. But it was a fluke that led her to turn to medicine. At the National University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo, she enrolled to study electronic engineering. But that class was full and the university could only accommodate her in medical classes. Her interest was ignited, and before long Kanyepi had transferred to the University of Zimbabwe to study for the degree her mother had always secretly believed she was destined for: medicine. In 2017 she moved to South to train as a heart surgeon at Inkosi Albert Luthuli central hospital in Durban. “I remember the day I walked into the hospital. That was when my life changed,” she says. Africa has a history of pioneering heart surgery. It was in Cape Town that Christiaan Barnard performed the in 1967. But despite cardiovascular disease being , responsible for 19.8 million deaths in 2022 – 80% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries, including in Africa – is high cost and unavailable in many countries, and there are continent-wide shortages of skilled surgeons and doctors. Dr Rajhmun Madansein, the head of cardiothoracic surgery at Inkosi, who trained Kanyepi, had also taught Lindiwe Sidali, South Africa’s first African female cardiothoracic surgeon. Sidali, who qualified in 2018, became an inspiration and mentor for Kanyepi. “Whenever we needed to be put straight, Lindiwe was the big sister,” she says. Kanyepi had just become a mother when she began her surgical training, having arrived in Durban nine months pregnant. “It was difficult to balance training and motherhood,” she says. “But I had extremely strong family support – my mother. This allowed me to continue to pursue heart surgery. “I had to do as much as men when I was training. When I came back, I had to [do] double the amount of work as my male colleagues to prove that I know what I am doing.” Even so, she adds: “In the private practice, there are people who simply do not refer [patients] to me because I am a woman. And they do not think the calibre of training I received is the same. There is this misconception that women have it easier.” Kanyepi says this is the downside of being a pioneer in her field in Zimbabwe. “When people talk about the first female, they think it is all glamour, glory and excitement. But there is always the other side. You have to navigate being the only one,” she says. Kanyepi is determined to stay in Zimbabwe, despite the increasing challenges of working in in search of better pay and working conditions. “It was tough when I came back to work under a limited healthcare system. But I believe I can do a lot with a limited system,” says Kanyepi, who works at Harare’s government-run Parirenyatwa hospital, which was , Zimbabwe’s president, in June after a growing outcry at the state of the country’s deteriorated health system. Kanyepi is now mentoring other trainees and wants to establish a foundation to support girls from disadvantaged communities to study medicine. “My passion is to eventually start a foundation to help young girls who want to be cardiothoracic surgeons and children who want to access cardiac surgery,” she says. “Performing a heart surgery is inspiring because to perform heart surgery, you have to stop the heart. The machines take over. After surgery, the heart starts to beat again. That is the moment you realise the power of God.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/22/food-aid-gaza-deaths-visual-story-ghf-israel,Eleven-minute race for food: how aid points in Gaza became ‘death traps’ – a visual story,2025-07-22T10:47:57.000Z,"Hundreds of people have died while seeking food since delivery was taken over by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in May. But Palestinians facing extreme hunger have no choice but to take the risk aed Jamal sends the message shortly after he returns, empty-handed, from an aid distribution point to his tent in the al-Mawasi displacement camp in south-west . “The tanks came and started firing. Three boys near me were martyred,” says the 36-year-old, who has four children. “I didn’t even get anything, just two empty boxes.” Jamal’s journey involved a long walk to and from a former residential neighbourhood bulldozed by Israeli forces and turned into one of four militarised aid distribution centres run by the Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Delaware in the US. The GHF sites – Tal al-Sultan, Saudi neighbourhood, Khan Younis and Wadi Gaza – are located in evacuation zones, which means civilians seeking food have to enter areas they have been ordered to leave. According to GHF’s Facebook page, the sites remain open for as little as eight minutes at a time, and in June the average for the Saudi site was 11 minutes. These factors have led to accusations from NGOs that the system is dangerous by design. The Unrwa chief, Philippe Lazzarini, “the so-called mechanism … is a death trap costing more lives than it saves.” The system favours the strongest, so it is mostly men who travel along the designated routes. Then they wait – often for hours – for a centre to open. Finally, there is a dash into the centre of the zones and a scramble to grab a box. At every stage, those seeking aid pass Israeli tanks and troops, as quadcopters fly above. In another clip shared by Jamal he ducks as bullets pass overhead. “We have purged our hearts of fear,” Jamal says of his near daily walks to the site. “I need to bring food for my children so they don’t die of hunger.” GHF, a startup organisation with no experience of distributing food in complex conflict zones, employs US mercenaries at the sites, which opened in May. They replaced 400 non-militarised aid points run under a UN system that Israel claimed had to be shut down because Hamas was diverting aid from it. No evidence for this has been provided. from the centres and other humanitarian convoys, according to the UN. The sites’ opening times are usually announced in posts on a and, more recently, messages sent through a Telegram channel. A WhatsApp channel was also set up in the first weeks. People have been warned not to approach the centres until they open. As the chart below shows, for the site Jamal visited, the amount of time between the site’s opening time being announced and the opening itself decreased dramatically in June. Mahmoud Alareer, a 27-year-old living in a tent in western Gaza City, says the opening time announcements for the aid site he uses – Wadi Gaza – have become useless, because of the distance from where he is living. Instead, he travels to the edges of the site in the middle of the night and gambles on it opening at 2am, as it has on every visit so far. First he climbs on to the back of a truck for the long ride south from Gaza City through the militarised Netzarim corridor. Then he waits in the dark until Israeli forces allow him to enter. “You get there and you slowly, slowly advance,” he says. “You always know that it could be you who gets shot, or it might be someone next to you.” Alareer says chaos always ensues when the aid point opens, as people start running towards the packages, which are left in the middle of the distribution zone. People trip over craters and tangled wires. GHF has faced severe criticism from the humanitarian community due to the dangers posed to Palestinians both at the sites and on the roads around them. In early July, , accusing it of violating the principles of humanitarian aid, and calling for the resumption of non-militarised aid in Gaza. Médecins Sans Frontières’ (MSF) emergency coordinator in Gaza, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, says night-time distributions are particularly dangerous because so many roads in southern Gaza have been made unrecognisable by Israeli bombing, making it hard for Palestinians to stick to routes designated by GHF. Zabalgogeazkoa is scathing about the GHF system. “This is not humanitarian aid,” he says. “We can only think that it was designed to cause damage to the people seeking aid.” A GHF spokesperson denied that their system was unsafe, claiming that the danger was outside their distribution zones. They also accused the UN of using “exaggerated” casualty figures. The IDF have been contacted for comment. GHF has previously defended its operations and accused its critics of engaging in a “turf war” over humanitarian supplies. It says it bears no responsibility for deaths outside the perimeters of its sites. at Palestinians who it says have approached its forces in a suspicious manner. It has also disputed some of the death tolls provided by the Palestinian authorities. GHF runs only four sites to feed 2 million people, in a territory where extreme hunger is widespread and . According to figures released by Gaza’s health ministry 33 people have died due to starvation and malnutrition since Sunday. It says it has delivered more than 85 million meals “ ” since its operations began. According to these figures, each box would provide a family with about 60 meals. The organisation has posted photos of GHF-marked boxes that have items such as flour, potatoes, beans and oil. However, Palestinians in Gaza have shared pictures showing open boxes at GHF sites containing a smaller range of items. Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, says she could not comment on the specific logistics of GHF, but that aid should go beyond food and should include water, cooking gas or other cooking facilities. “If you look at Gaza now … people have been deprived of everything that sustains life: shelter materials, fuel, cooking gas, hygiene materials, everything that one needs to feel dignified, to have some sort of semblance of normality,” she says. (WFP), nearly a third of Gaza’s population is going several days without food, and 470,000 people are expected to face the most severe levels of hunger between May and September this year. The WFP has also warned that dietary diversity declined sharply in May and continued to worsen in June. Damage to farmland over the course of the war has only increased Palestinians’ reliance on aid. A study published this year using satellite imagery to assess damage to farmland found A Unosat assessment from April found that . This sequence shows damage to greenhouses and orchards in Beit Lahiya. In late March, dozens of bakeries supported by the WFP halted production due to the Israeli blockade. A handful briefly resumed bread production in May when some trucks were allowed into the territory, as this timeline shows. Jamal reiterates that he has no choice but to return to his nearest GHF site, despite the dangers. “I have gone four days in a row and not brought anything back, not even flour – nothing,” he says. “Sometimes you just can’t beat the others. But what else can we do, our life is a struggle.” This article was amended on 22 July 2025. An earlier version said the price of flour in Gaza had risen by 31 May to $420 per kg. This was based on a published UN figure that had later been corrected to $420 for a 25kg bag.",Kaamil Ahmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Kenya-based WorldPath House of Travel, with more than 20,000 followers on the social media platform, promised hassle-free work visas for jobs across Europe. “They were showing work permits they’d received, envelopes, like: ‘We have Europe visas already,’” Lilian recalls. After transferring a deposit of 150,000 Kenyan shillings (£870) – one year’s savings – Lilian received a document with the letterhead of a Netherlands-based recruitment agency, Undutchables, offering her the role of “fruits and vegetable sorter” in Amsterdam. But WorldPath House of Travel is not registered with Kenya’s . And its supposed partnership with Undutchables is nonexistent, the agency’s general manager, Nick van der Dussen, confirmed, calling WorldPath’s recruitment effort a “scam”. As the months dragged on, Lilian realised she had been duped. WorldPath ignored her repeated requests for a refund and claimed its phone number was out of service, according to messages seen by the Guardian. WorldPath is far from the only unregistered recruiter on TikTok. The Guardian identified more than a dozen agencies that are not accredited with the Kenyan government, as they are legally required to be, but which are using the platform to promote warehouse, factory, hospitality and security work around the world. Several accounts linked to alleged scams have since been deleted and apparently restarted under new usernames. Six Kenyans who lost money to such agencies have shared their stories with the Guardian. They paid between 100,000 and 545,000 Kenyan shillings to recruiters, selling their cattle, taking out bank loans and borrowing from family and friends to cover commission fees for jobs that never materialised. to great lengths to convince job seekers of their legitimacy, in one case proffering falsified documents from a Toronto hospital and Canadian immigration authorities, and setting up fake interviews with purported employers in others. “When you’re desperate, you tend to fall for things easily,” says one jobless Kenyan who has not yet told their family they lost more than 350,000 Kenyan shillings to an agency advertising on TikTok. “The office was good, in a good building, nice location, well arranged, several staff – I got the idea that this is something that is good.” Kenya’s economy is stagnant, with the World Bank estimating youth unemployment of and a cost of living crisis that last year. The Kenyan government is facilitating labour export to address unemployment and strengthen its economy through remittances. It plans to place In the meantime, many Kenyans are taking their job search to TikTok. About of the population now uses the platform, according to the Reuters Institute, up from At least one TikToker has faced criminal charges. In March, Maria Kamunge, popularly known as Rish Kamunge, accused of soliciting money from dozens of Kenyans for bogus foreign jobs. She denied the charges. that she closed her offices in Kenya. In May, Kenya’s Ministry of Labour and Social Protection a list of more than 30 blacklisted agencies and said it was investigating more than 150 more amid accusations of illegal recruitment practices. But agencies that are not on Kenya’s public list of registered recruiters have continued to proliferate on TikTok. Halisi Affiliates, which Kenyan business records show was founded in December 2023, used the platform to advertise jobs across Europe and North America as an unregistered recruiter. Nimo*, 27, says she paid Halisi 150,000 Kenyan shillings in October 2024 to secure her sister a restaurant job in Romania. But the sisters grew suspicious during Zoom calls with Halisi and more than 50 other Kenyans who received the same offer, according to screenshots of a meeting. Some had been waiting for months with no update. The sisters demanded their money back, but discovered Halisi had closed down its office and social media. Another jobseeker, Sylvia Wairimu Maina, 31, says she paid Halisi a deposit of 100,000 Kenyan shillings in September 2024 for an assistant nursing role in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, arranged through Halisi’s British partner, Global Employment Consultant, according to documents and messages shared with the Guardian. Halisi and Global Employment Consultant blamed one another for months-long delays, Maina says, and she never received a refund. Because she quit her caregiving job for the promised move, the experience left her with “no money, no savings”. “It was devastating,” says Maina. “And very draining.” Global Employment Consultant is not registered under UK business records, nor do any registrations containing “GEC” match its activities or address, which its website lists as a residential London building with an incorrect postcode. In November 2024, as Maina and Nimo’s families began questioning the delays of their placements, four of Halisi’s five founding officers registered a new company called Fly With Halisi, records show. By September this year, a Fly With Halisi account on TikTok came online, using a tweaked version of the Halisi Affiliates logo. A Facebook account appeared a month later. In a statement, Halisi told the Guardian it was “a victim of fraud by an overseas third-party partner” in Romania and that it left TikTok “to allow for internal review and cooperation with Kenyan authorities”, including filing a police report, refunding several clients and facilitating jobs for two people. It said its office closure was “not an attempt to evade clients”. The company denied any connection to the new TikTok account, but did not answer follow-up questions about its offices’ new business with the same name, or Maina’s case. TikTok did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including a list of the accounts tracked by the Guardian.

On one side are the Sudanese armed forces who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militia who follow the former warlord The RSF was founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia. Bashir wanted to crush a rebellion in the region of that began more than 20 years ago due to the political and economic marginalisation of the local population. , the RSF quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into a semi-organised paramilitary force and gave its leaders military ranks before deploying it to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. Hemedti’s power struggle with Burhan can be traced back to 2019 when the RSF and regular military forces cooperated to from power. When attempts to transition to a democratic civilian-led government faltered, many analysts felt an eventual showdown between Burhan and Hemedti was inevitable. The conflict has plunged Sudan into what the “one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”. Tens of thousands have died, millions have been displaced, and hunger and disease are rife. According to the most recent figures, about 26 million people face severe food insecurity. Famine has been declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in Darfur. About 11.3 million people have been forced to flee the fighting, including nearly 2.95 million who have fled across the country’s borders. Most have gone to Chad and South , where underfunded aid agencies say they are struggling to meet basic needs. A UN appeal for $1.51bn to support Sudanese refugees and their hosts in the region through the end of the year remains just 27% funded. In its latest humanitarian update, published on 1 October, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said significant declines in vaccination rates and the destruction of health infrastructure resulting from the war mean Sudan is grappling with multiple disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, dengue fever, measles, and rubella. An estimated 3.4 million children under the age of five are at high risk of epidemic diseases, according to Unicef. The conflict has also robbed huge numbers of an education. More than 90% of the country’s 19 million school-age children are unable to access formal education. Schools have been targeted in airstrikes, occupied by armed groups and used to store weapons. The UN has accused the army and the RSF of carrying out indiscriminate attacks in residential areas, committing acts of sexual violence, arbitrarily detaining and torturing civilians and recruiting child soldiers. Both parties may have committed war crimes, a UN report in February said. They have denied the claims. The US went a step further last year, declaring that both had carried out war crimes and that the RSF had committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Some of the war’s worst atrocities have been committed in Darfur, western Sudan. As many as 15,000 people were killed in the city of El Geneina in West Darfur last year by the RSF and allied Arab militias in violence targeted at the Masalit people. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the violence carried “haunting echoes of the genocide that began almost 20 years ago”. In June, pro-democracy activists said the RSF killed more than 100 people in an attack on a village in central Sudan. In recent weeks, the RSF has launched a full-scale attack on El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur it is yet to control. The attack follows a months-long siege. The city’s last hospital was after the paramilitary group stormed it in June. The RSF is also advancing in regions south of Khartoum. In the capital, which fell to the RSF early on in the war, the armed forces have gone on the offensive, pounding the centre and south of the city from the air this month. Several rounds of negotiation efforts have so far failed to end the fighting. Home to about 9 million people, Darfur, the vast and largely arid swath of western and south-western , has been at the centre of the conflict largely because it remains the stronghold of Hemedti. Many of the RSF’s recruits are drawn from the region and from Hemedti’s own Rizeigat tribe. For years, the RSF has terrorised communities in Darfur and much of the region is lawless: militias and other armed groups attack civilians with virtual impunity. In recent years, the RSF has invested significant resources in Darfur in an attempt to control its strategic assets, such as airstrips, mines, water sources and major roads. Analysts trace many of the roots of the latest conflict back to the appalling violence and human rights abuses in Darfur about 20 years ago.",Rachel Savage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can other countries follow suit? t was the 2000s, and fossil fuel prices were rising worldwide. After a period of volatility in the 1980s, the crude oil price per barrel had reached one of its lowest points – $20 – at the end of 2001 but then, over the course of six years, it tripled before a new oil shock saw prices surpass those of the 1970s, Uruguay imports its oil, so it had a problem. Demand for energy in the country had grown by 8.4% the previous year and household energy bills were increasing at a similar rate. The 3.4 million-strong population was becoming restless. Lacking alternatives, at higher prices, even though Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay To escape the trap, Vázquez needed rapid solutions. He turned to an unlikely source: , a physicist who would transform the country’s energy grid into one of the cleanest in the world. Today, the country has almost phased out fossil fuels in electricity production. . In some years, that number has crept as high as 98%. was a central issue at Cop28. After a week of tense negotiations in Dubai, countries – but campaigners, governments and environmental experts continue to debate how to make that transition. One answer could lie in what has achieved within a decade and a half. “I had been working abroad for 14 years, and when I came back, there was this energy crisis, but the only solution people were giving was to install a nuclear power plant – that was it,” Galain remembers. “I was a nuclear physicist, so I thought I could understand a little about this problem.” The more Galain researched the issue, the more he became convinced that nuclear power was not the answer for Uruguay. Instead, he argued, it was renewables. He published his findings in a paper that laid out his belief that the country should go all in on wind power. Soon after, he received a phone call inviting him to become Uruguay’s energy secretary and to implement his plan. “Imagine my surprise,” Galain says. “This was crazy. But I did something even more crazy: I accepted.” Uruguay is a small country – about 26% smaller than the UK by area – wedged between two giants. Argentina’s sprawling capital, Buenos Aires, lies 31 miles (50km) south of the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, which forms part of the border between the two countries, while Uruguay shares its northern border with Brazil. In this context, the country is easily overlooked. However, economically it is a South American success story. , according to the World Bank, the highest on the continent; only a tiny fraction of its population lives in extreme poverty. – and there are high expectations for lifestyle and opportunities. Such demographic change has driven demand for the trappings of a contemporary, 21st-century lifestyle. Homes are fitted with washing machines and dishwashers, and air-conditioning units have become commonplace, as have vast flat-screen TVs and connected devices. All of that requires power. Over the course of about a decade, Uruguay, under the stewardship of Galain, installed about 50 windfarms across the country, decarbonised the grid and bolstered its hydropower. The biggest challenge, however, was to change the “narrative” about renewables. Back then, sustainable energies were still surrounded by many misconceptions, says Galain: they were too expensive, too intermittent or would raise unemployment – and changing these stories proved vital to getting buy-in from all levels of society. “No one believed we could do it. We needed new solutions. We needed to do things differently,” he says. “Today, even members of that cabinet say to me: ‘When you were saying those things on TV in 2008, we were thinking, how are we going to explain this when we fail?’” Galain says there needed to be a “strong national narrative” to make it work. “I told people this was the best option even if they don’t believe climate change exists. It’s the cheapest and not dependent on crazy fluctuations [in oil prices].” With that narrative, the government set about winning over a sceptical populace. One initial concern was that jobs would be lost in the energy sector. – a large number in a country with such a small population. , and some workers were offered places on retraining schemes to adapt to the new normal. Others were able to take advantage of the changes. Santiago Revello, 52, owns a beef farm in central Uruguay, about 175 miles north of the capital, Montevideo. Beef production is a primary industry across the country, owing to its vast swathes of grasslands. The farm broke even financiallybut in 2009, the Revello family was debating whether to sell its farm. That was when Revello met Fernando Schaich, who ran what was previously a small energy-efficiency consultancy, and had learned about the country’s transition to renewables. Schaich had spotted an opportunity in the transition plan early on. His company had previously made its money by advising businesses on how they could cut their energy usage, but it moved into windfarm development. He told Revello that his family’s farm could be a site for an onshore windfarm – and that building one need not affect his cattle. The pair prepared a bid for a contract and went to a developer, but lost. “Fernando was gutted by this,” Revello says. “He told me: ‘You can go with another company.’ But he had always been honest with me, so I told him: ‘It’s not all about money.’” Today, Revello’s farm is home to 22 wind turbines, a side business that gives the family a healthy source of income. ruguay’s green transition has not been without its challenges, however. One was logistics, according to Gonzalo Casaravilla, who served as president of the state energy company UTE between 2010 and 2020. Outside cities, Uruguay’s roads are small, with few motorways. The parts of wind turbines are anything but small, and moving them into position a difficult undertaking. This was achieved by means of rolling roadblocks and convoys to create minimum disruption when new windfarm projects were built. “It was funny. In the beginning, the technical people in my company were saying: ‘Whoa, be careful.’ A year and a half later, they said: ‘OK, it’s a good idea,” says Casaravilla. “There was friction at the beginning, but then it was the best team we could have had.” The transition has not been universally popular. There are occasional grumbles from people who wonder why their energy bills have not fallen if renewable energy is “free”. This is a complaint that Galain shrugs off. “People are wondering what happened and why their bill isn’t lower,” he says. “But in that same time period, we had 40% poverty; now it’s 10%, and extreme poverty has almost disappeared. “People now have air conditioning that they didn’t have before, using more and more electricity.” Xavier Costantini, a partner at the consultancy McKinsey, based in Montevideo, says that the idea that renewable energy is free is a misconception. There are maintenance costs – although relatively modest – but crucially, the initial investment needs to be paid back. The question of whether Uruguay’s transition provides a vital blueprint for the world is not a simple one. Some characteristics gave the country an advantage, Costantini says. It is “blessed by nature” with strong winds and considerable hydropower, which is sometimes sold to Brazil when in surplus. An alternative energy source such as hydropower is vital to plug gaps in a renewable grid as wind and solar are intermittent. Unlike some countries in the region, Uruguay is very stable politically, which made investing for the long term much more palatable for foreign companies, Costantini says. It also had relatively high tax rates on imports, a lever it was able to use to encourage foreign investment. However, such conditions can be found elsewhere. In the UK, for example, Scotland has considerable hydropower potential. “Full decarbonisation is expensive, but you could get to a high level of decarbonisation,” Costantini says. “I’d say by the end of the next decade, there’s certainly [scope] for a country such as the UK to have a highly decarbonised grid at a very cost-competitive rate.” Uruguay, meanwhile, has moved on to what is becoming known as the second stage of its transition. It is gradually moving its buses and public vehicles over to electric, and incentivising taxi and minicab drivers to switch. How well this works could provide a global roadmap for how other countries can decarbonise their economies.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/10/father-ken-saro-wiwa-died-fighting-clean-enery-nigeria-thirty-years-oil,"My father, Ken Saro-Wiwa, died fighting for a clean Nigeria. Thirty years on, it’s time to stop sucking on the dirty teat of the oil cash cow",2025-11-10T12:15:48.000Z,"In 1995, as one of the Ogoni Nine, he was hanged after protesting against Shell’s oil pollution. With education and a move towards renewable energy, we can honour his legacy , and his eight colleagues, known collectively as the , were pardoned for a crime they never committed. After peacefully campaigning against environmental degradation of Ogoniland in Nigeria at the hands of the oil industry, they were imprisoned by the military dictatorship on false charges of treason and incitement to murder, following a trial condemned by the international community as a sham. On 10 November 1995, the men were executed by hanging. Thirty years on, the government of President Bola Tinubu granted a pardon to the Ogoni Nine. While our families welcome this as a step in the right direction, it is not enough – a pardon suggests that these nine innocent men committed a crime. Although the court of public opinion recognises their innocence and courage, it is important that they are officially exonerated. The refusal of successive governments to do this speaks volumes. It speaks of a corrupt cabal that has ruled directly and indirectly over the past few decades and continues to stifle any attempt to honour my father’s memory. But that legacy can never be suppressed. Ken Saro-Wiwa and thousands of brave Ogoni protesters ensured that Shell Oil pulled out of Ogoniland in 1993. Since then, the multinational for some of its environmental damage and was ordered to pay compensation for oil spills including earlier this year and sold its onshore leases to a local consortium (which ). My father’s death led to the creation of the , which continues its task of cleaning up the hydrocarbon pollution in Ogoniland, albeit with mixed results. Pollution levels are still unacceptably high. Militancy, the sabotaging of pipelines and illegal refining have further damaged the environment, and now, high unemployment and the cost of living crisis have compelled some Ogonis to call for the resumption of oil extraction. While I fully sympathise with their wishes, welcoming back the oil companies would be an insult to my father’s memory and a huge step backwards. The industry, even if properly managed, is not labour intensive and it benefits a relative few. Its continued extraction elsewhere in the delta offers a cautionary tale. Last year, I drove through the Obrikom oil and gas field, about 50 miles (80km) northwest of Ogoniland, where I saw crude petroleum gushing furiously from a broken pipe and into a river. The sight of that blackened water was horrifying. That the pipeline wasn’t fixed for months was even more appalling. Ironically, I witnessed that leak while on my way to visit a renewable energy project that I was involved with as a consultant. A solar power plant has now been , enabling the remote riverine community to rely entirely on clean energy. There are no oil spills and no tensions about who will be employed by the energy company. Residents fish and farm the land, which is how it should be. Why suck on the dirty teat of the petroleum cash cow when we have incredible natural assets? In September, I visited a conservation project, the , where Rachel Ashegbofe Ikemeh and her team are doing a sterling job of conserving a slice of the Apoi Creek, a primary rainforest that is home to the last most-significant population of the Niger Delta red colobus monkey, bush pigs, the African pied hornbill, water chevrotains, the mangabey and other species. The forest is a glimpse into our beautiful ecological past and a preview of what could be regained under the right stewardship. Ikemeh’s team have successfully educated the Apoi community about protecting the forest and its wildlife rather than eating it. It is an education sorely needed elsewhere in the region. Just a few weeks ago, on an Ogoni Facebook group page, I saw a photo of a live giant leatherback turtle that had been dragged into a village after washing up on shore. I was amazed and excited, yet in the comment section people discussed whether it should be eaten or not. Meanwhile, in places such as Tobago and Costa Rica, tourists pay thousands of dollars to come and see turtles like that. The animal’s appearance on our shores, though rare, proves that wildlife still exists in the Niger delta’s lushly vegetated creeks, rivers and beaches. Accommodating nature and farming is a huge conundrum, of course, but there’s an economy that can be created by leveraging our natural assets. Crucially, it requires moving towards non-polluting, renewable energy that can power our small businesses cleanly and reliably, and boost the economy. My father understood that our wealth lies in our ecology and in education, and that we could one day move away from oil, especially if it enriches everyone else at the Ogonis’ expense. I remember him showing me and my siblings around the garden in our house in Port Harcourt, teaching us about the flowers and the fireflies. Through the Ken Saro-Wiwa Foundation, which will relaunch in the coming months, I hope we can boost education and bring solar energy to Ogoniland and gradually transform it into a place of non-oil entrepreneurship, agriculture and natural beauty that will honour my father’s legacy.",Noo Saro-Wiwa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their defiance comes more than three years after the killing of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman taken into custody by the “morality police” for allegedly breaching the dress code rules. Her death led to the for years in Iran and a crackdown by security services in response, with , which came into force in 2024, women caught “promoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing” face severe penalties, including fines of up to £12,500, flogging and prison sentences ranging from five to 15 years for repeat offenders. The authorities have also encouraged members of the public to become “ ” through a state-backed reporting platform that allows them to report women for alleged violations. Two young female friends meet up in Laleh park to rest and drink tea together after a long working day. They used to be classmates studying English In December, the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said the hijab was crucial “to preserve the dignity of women and to restrain very strong and ”, heralding the start of a new push to enforce the dress code laws. Within days, the security forces intensified their hijab enforcement. The organisers of a popular marathon race in Kish Island, off the southern coast of Iran, of “violating public decency” for allowing women to run unveiled. But speaking to the Guardian, women in say public opinion has shifted and even more women are open to flouting the dress code rules despite the increase in arrests and penalties. “We never needed Khamenei’s permission, nor do we need it now. The scenes you are witnessing are because we do not care what he has to say,” says Hoda*, a Tehran-based journalist. A young couple share a kiss while picnicking in Tehran’s Laleh Park “We are running out of water [ ], there are growing labour protests and the war with Israel has left the administration weak. Hijab is an easy distraction while they deal with all these serious issues.” Although Hoda accepts that more women will be arrested, she says the Iranian authorities would avoid mass arrests because “last time they did it, they looked like fools across the world”. In Tehran, Golnar*, a visual artist, believes young Iranians will not return to previous norms. She recently filmed a police officer warning teenagers who were playing music; the group ignored him. She says the regime, weakened by war and sanctions, “needs good PR” and cannot risk viral images of hijab arrests. “Do I have it in the back of my head that I will be at any time dragged into a van? Yes, I am not going to lie. But the plan is to push the boundaries collectively, so they can’t break a few of us,” says Golnar.

Women cannot obtain bike licences in Iran, yet her group rides weekly. “They have become very lax and don’t stop us any more,” she says. Shaghayegh says she no longer wears a headscarf off the bike. “If I wear a hijab now, I feel I’m undoing all the sacrifices so many Iranians have made. There’s no going back.” While most viral videos come from Tehran, women in other provinces also report a shift in attitudes. Leyla*, a business owner in the central Iranian city of Shiraz, says she has never seen the city so energised. “Honestly, it’s really hopeful to see. The fact that more and more women choose how they dress is exactly what makes them braver. These visuals are a proof of our bravery and not the reform that many pro-regime folks are pointing to.” Two girls view Picasso’s Guernica at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, where a large number of the artist’s original works are on display. Many of these pieces are being exhibited for the first time In Iran’s northern Kurdistan region, Zerin*, a student says “morality police” presence is minimal but broader targeting continues. “In Kurdistan we are targeted by the authorities for our Kurdish identity and hijab isn’t the only concern. “I fear when they start enforcing hijab in Tehran, they will use that as an excuse to make mass arrests of our men and women simply over our identity, and make up national security and spy charges like they have been doing before and after Mahsa Amini’s death.” Skylar Thompson, deputy director of Human Rights Activists in Iran, says the authorities lack the capacity to enforce hijab consistently and are, perhaps, reluctant to confront women amid domestic and international pressures. “The political, security, and economic climate is fragile and even a small provocation could trigger new unrest.”",Deepa Parent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/03/prison-feminist-issue-jailing-marginalised-women-ruins-lives-children,‘Bad girls’ is how society labels women in prison. But what if that label is a lie?,2025-12-03T06:00:56.000Z,"Incarceration should be a last resort, yet this broken and brutal system punishes marginalised women, most of whom are inside for non-violent crimes hen you imprison a woman, you imprison a family,” a young woman in Sierra Leone told me, cradling her small baby in a damp cell. My mind flashed back to being a teenager, hearing my mother sob after receiving a phone call to say that my father had been arrested in Zambia for political reasons. I understand how children are collateral damage of imprisonment, and over 20 years as a lawyer, I know that is even more true when women – primary caregivers – are arrested. I have witnessed the devastating impact of incarceration on hundreds of women and their children but also how their voices are ignored, even in women’s rights spaces. “Bad girls” is how society labels women in prison. But what if that label is a lie? The majority of women are imprisoned for non-violent offences, and , conducted by Women Beyond Walls and Penal Reform International over the past two years, shows that in most cases women are criminalised due to poverty, mental illness, abuse or discrimination. , as opposed to less than a third of men, have a drug dependence in the year before imprisonment. In Pollsmoor prison in South Africa, where Nelson Mandela was once detained, a woman told me how she had been arrested for shoplifting, as she tried to feed her family. In Sierra Leone, I documented countless women who were arrested for owing money. In Kenya, I heard stories of women being arrested for “hawking” – selling food without a licence – to survive. Women from Mexico explained how the US-led “war on drugs” is fuelling a rise in the number of women behind bars, especially in Latin America and Asia. Many women sell drugs due to poverty and coercion; though not major players in the drug trade, they are easier to apprehend by police trying to meet quotas. The small proportion of women who commit violent crimes are usually survivors of violence themselves. Women such as 21-year-old Chisomo from Malawi, who was arrested for the murder of her ex-partner. He sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she left him. Chisomo finally fled after he attempted to stab her. However, he later attacked her, stabbing her in her arm and chest. She grabbed the knife and struck back in self-defence. I have collaborated with lawyers across the world who fight for legal processes to take into consideration a woman’s background of poverty and abuse. But despite these efforts, a legal system built by men and for men continues to fail women through sexism and gender bias. Those who do not fulfil traditional stereotypes of the moral and motherly woman are often punished more harshly. Prisons are not safe spaces for women. Vulnerable women go into prison and come out further traumatised. I have documented cases where women have experienced sexual violence and heard how practices such as invasive strip-searches and solitary confinement cause further harm to women with histories of sexual abuse or mental health challenges. Imprisoned women’s rates of self-harm are often higher than in men’s prisons. Despite international standards mandating that prison should be a last resort, especially for pregnant women and women with young children, I continue to encounter tragic stories of women who miscarry and of babies who die in detention. Children – inside and outside prison – are invisible victims. There are at least detained in prison with their mothers and The intergenerational harms of parental imprisonment on children are well researched. I will never forget trying to trace the children of a desperate mother in Sierra Leone, who had no idea what happened to them after she was arrested. A neighbour had taken them in but the nine-year-old girl went to sell items on the street to make money and was never seen again. One of my biggest frustrations is how women’s incarceration continues to be a blind spot. High-level forums on women’s rights, where policy and funding priorities are set, continue to overlook this issue. There was no mention at all of incarcerated women in the political declaration at the Women Beyond Walls’ research indicates how organisations working with and for incarcerated women are critically underfunded, even by donors to human rights and women’s rights causes. For too long, stigma, a desire to promote only “sympathetic victims” and sidelining those who do not fit into neat narratives has meant that marginalised women and their children are ignored, despite pledges by the UN to “leave no one behind”. But despite witnessing suffering, I also see hope. Around the world, women are reimagining what justice could look like, from inside and outside prison walls. , a Colombian organisation that campaigns for female prisoners, joined other activists to help pass an innovative law allowing women to serve community sentences rather than imprisonment in certain circumstances. In Sierra Leone, I worked with a feminist legal group, AdvocAid, to challenge colonial-era loitering laws. In the UK, women’s centres offer a model of community support that is more effective and less costly than prison. Two years ago, I was at the first convening of the , which brings together women from more than 30 countries. I wept to hear stories of women turning years of pain into something empowering, providing each other with solidarity and working together to reshape systems that affect them. As the number of women in prison continues to grow at an alarming rate – – and we look set to reach more than one million women in prison, this is a wake-up call. Next year offers advocacy opportunities to redress this omittance – from the UN Commission on the Status of Women to the States must be held accountable for their failure to implement UN standards and lack of investment in alternatives to incarceration. Donors need to resource the vibrant movement of women with lived experience, lawyers, family members and activists, who are chipping away at a broken and brutal system. Prison is a feminist issue and is deeply intertwined with other women’s rights struggles, including gender-based violence, reproductive rights and poverty. Reducing women’s mass incarceration must be a global priority so that marginalised women and their children stop being punished for systemic injustice.",Sabrina Mahtani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/15/health-why-ghana-losing-nurses-emigration-who-medics,‘It’s a timebomb’: Ghana grapples with mass exodus of nurses as thousands head to the west,2025-12-15T13:00:01.000Z,"An estimated 6,000 nurses left in 2024 for roles in countries including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Three nurses explain what made them decide to leave or stay hen Bright Ansah, a nursing officer in Accra, goes searching for colleagues who have failed to show up for a shift at the overstretched hospital where he works, he knows where to look. “When you see ‘In God we trust’ on their WhatsApp status, that’s when you know they’re already in the US,” he says. The motto of the US has been co-opted by Ghanaian medical professionals who are leaving the west African nation in droves. Many believe their faith has finally been rewarded when, after years of planning, they reach the promised land of the well-equipped, well-resourced hospitals of the US. Since the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc on global healthcare systems, the number of nurses, midwives and doctors to have left has risen exponentially. It is estimated that at least 6,000 nurses left in 2024, driven by factors such as low wages, unpaid salaries and worsening infrastructure. While the US is a huge draw, nurses are also migrating to other countries including the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and the UAE. Meanwhile, in May and October, Ghana’s foreign ministry signed agreements with to send hundreds of nurses to the Caribbean islands, expanding on . In July, the health minister announced that The government’s justification for the schemes is that Ghana , with tens of thousands unemployed. But Ghana is also one of 55 countries on the , which identifies nations facing the most pressing workforce challenges related to universal health coverage. And those working on the frontline of healthcare feel they are on the precipice of a crisis. “It’s a timebomb,” says Ansah. “In Ghana, you have a population of 35 million, and the nurse-to-patient ratio is so wide that the nurses are overburdened; they are burnt out. Yet the government wants to export its most experienced nurses to a place like , which has a population of 125,000. “I agree that most of our nurses want to go,” he says, “but we don’t have to intentionally push them out.” Nursing has long been considered a desirable profession in Ghana, offering job security in a country where steady employment is in short supply. It has also become increasingly attractive for other reasons. An established route to migration, it has seen an increase in new entrants as people seek to move, although the schemes are open only to experienced medics. Three nurses who have chosen different paths explain why they decided to stay, go, or wait and see what happens. “I’m personally excited to stay because I still feel there’s a lot I can do for my country,” says Ansah, who receives messages daily from former colleagues, now abroad, showing off their state-of-the-art equipment and comfortable lifestyles. While he understands the frustrations that led them to leave their jobs, families and country, he remains stoic about his decision to stay. “I believe I can help save lives. If we all leave, who will look after our mothers and fathers when they need medical care?” he asks. Although he calls the average monthly salary of 3,000 Ghanaian cedis (£197) “demoralising” and concedes that some nurses have resorted to selling medications to patients as a means of survival, he has managed to make things work by taking an entrepreneurial approach to his career. With a PhD in public health, he combines teaching at a university with nursing, hoping to equip the next generation with the skills and mindset necessary to stay. He has also established a healthcare firm providing consultancy services. “We need a multisector stakeholder approach. We shouldn’t just be interested in scoring political points but in addressing the problems. Why are they leaving? What can we do to retain them as much as we can? Even those who are emigrating are interested in returning to contribute to nation-building. These are things that we need to look at. “I’ve had a couple of colleagues who vowed to be in the country, whatever happens, but when the pressure exceeded what they could bear, they all left. We have to do better.” Nana Yaa Mills, a mother of three, is happily taking her family and leaving Ghana for good, but her mother and sister are dreading having to say goodbye. “They’re so sad,” says Mills. “They say, ‘But you’re here every time we call. Now you’re going, who are we going to call?’ I tell them, ‘You can still call me. I’m leaving, but life goes on.’” For Mills, that life is now in the US. Though she has spent the past 12 years nursing patients in various hospitals in Accra, she has had enough of the stress and chaos, and she is not alone. Of the 15 nurses she started with in 2017 at the hospital where she worked, only three remain in Ghana. “The majority have gone to the US,” she says. “Three are in the UK, and one is in Ireland.” The move has been a long time coming. In 2022, Mills travelled to South Africa to take the required to work as a nurse in the US and Canada. The offer of a job came earlier this year but Mills believes she can still make a difference. “The authorities only respect you once you go,” she says of her hospital managers. “We diaspora nurses have big plans to use our influence to make things better. We are organising ourselves; we want to make a change.” Mills is part of a group of more than 1,000 nurses that began as a learning platform on WhatsApp but has since evolved into a support forum for those wanting to migrate. Many feel they have been forced into leaving and there is genuine bitterness and anger towards the system and patients. “The same people we are advocating for don’t do that for us. When we go on strike, they are the same people who insult us. So everyone is on their own now.” Though hostility towards immigrants is high in the US, Mills is not concerned. “I’m just happy. Even here we face it. Relatives of patients will just come and insult you, so it’s normal. Racism is everywhere. We just have to develop tough skin.” “Sometimes they don’t understand how they’ve taken you through school with the expectation that, when you finish, some of the burden will come off, but you’re still dependent on them for food, transportation and rent,” Afua Tetteh says of her parents. “And you’re working. So it just doesn’t make sense to them.” Tetteh is part of a cohort of nurses who took to the streets in October to protest over months of unpaid wages, although she did not participate herself, despite her own grievances. She had to wait for nine months after graduation before being allocated a hospital placement. Five months later, she has only just been paid, but not in full, despite going to work every day, travelling 13 miles each way on public transport, and returning home late after her shifts. Tetteh’s aunt, who is also a nurse, has been instrumental in helping her adapt and stay the course. One of the biggest problems caused by the flight of experienced nurses is that new recruits such as Tetteh have no one to look to for advice and support. They are having to learn processes and procedures on the job that would normally be performed by senior staff. “There are about 30 patients on the ward and only two nurses, plus two of us service personnel and maybe one or two students. It’s extremely stressful. “I’m lucky I have my aunt, so if I have any difficulties I just pick up the phone and call her. When you see the nurses, you realise how tired they are of the entire job. I really don’t want that to be my portion working in this country.” Age and inexperience prevent Tetteh from leaving Ghana in the short term, so she is facing her immediate future pragmatically. Asked whether she has considered a career change she says that, although it has crossed her mind and some of her peers have abandoned nursing for less stressful jobs, she hopes to stick with it. “Life goes how God wants it to go,” she says, “but, hopefully, in five years’ time I should have been able to leave the country or maybe have a side-business so I can get my life together and know where I’m headed. Right now, things look very unclear for someone who is starting out.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/04/families-ultra-processed-food-uganda-nepal-parents-children-healthy,"‘One bite and he was hooked’: from Kenya to Nepal, how parents are battling ultra-processed foods",2025-12-04T12:00:21.000Z,"Five families around the world share their struggles to keep their children away from UPFs he scourge of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is global. While their consumption is particularly high in the west, forming more than half the average diet in the UK and the US, for example, UPFs are replacing fresh food in diets on every continent. on the health threats of UPFs was published in the Lancet. It warned that such foods are exposing millions of people to long-term harm, and called for urgent action. Earlier this year Unicef revealed that for the first time, as junk food overwhelms diets, with the steepest rises in low- and middle-income countries. Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, and one of the Lancet series’ authors, says that profit-driven corporations, not individual choices, are driving the change in habits. For parents, it can feel like the entire food system is working against them. “Sometimes it feels like we have zero control over what we are putting on to our kid’s plate,” says one mother from . We spoke to her and four other parents from around the world on the growing challenges and frustrations of providing a healthy diet in the age of UPFs. today often feels like trying to swim against the current, especially when it comes to food. I cook at home as much as I can, but the moment my daughter steps outside, she is surrounded by brightly packaged snacks and sugary drinks. She constantly craves cookies, chocolates and packaged fruit juices – products aggressively advertised to children. A single pizza commercial on TV is enough for her to ask, “Can we have pizza today?” Even the school environment reinforces unhealthy habits. Her canteen serves sweetened fruit juice every Tuesday, which she eagerly awaits. She receives a six-piece biscuit pack from a friend on the school bus and chocolates on birthdays, and faces a chip shop right outside her school gate. Some days it feels like the entire food environment is working against parents who are simply trying to raise healthy children. As someone working in the Nepal Non-Communicable Disease Alliance and leading a project called Promoting Healthy Foods in Schools to Reduce NCD Risk Factors, I understand this issue deeply. Yet even with my expertise, keeping my eight-year-old daughter healthy is incredibly difficult. These repeated exposures at school, in transit and online make it nearly impossible for parents to limit ultra-processed foods. It is not just about children’s choices; it is about a food system that normalises and promotes unhealthy eating. And the data reflects exactly what families like mine are experiencing. The 2022 found that 69% of children between six and 23 months ate unhealthy foods, and 43% were already drinking sweetened beverages. These numbers echo what I see every day. conducted in the Lalitpur district, where I live, reported that 18.6% of schoolchildren were overweight and 7.1% were obese, figures closely associated with the rise in junk food consumption and increasingly inactive lifestyles. Another study showed that many Nepali children eat sweet snacks or processed savoury foods almost daily, and this regular consumption is tied to high levels of tooth decay. Nepal urgently needs stronger policies, healthier school environments and stricter marketing regulations. Until then, families will continue fighting a daily battle against junk food – one biscuit packet at a time. My situation is a bit unique as I was forced to relocate from an island in our archipelago that was devastated by Hurricane Beryl last year. But it is also part of the stark reality that is facing parents in a region that is feeling the very worst effects of climate change. Even before Beryl, as a food nutrition and health teacher, I was deeply concerned about the increasing proliferation of fast food restaurants in . Today, even smaller village shops are complicit in the transformation of a country once defined by a diet of healthy locally grown fruits and vegetables, to one where greasy, salty, sugary fast food, packed with artificial ingredients, is the preference. But the situation definitely worsens if a hurricane or volcanic eruption wipes out most of your vegetation. Fresh, healthy food becomes scarce and very expensive, so it is really difficult to get your kids to eat right. Despite having a steady job I wince at food prices now and have often resorted to choosing between items such as peas and beans and meat and eggs when feeding my four children. Serving fewer meals or smaller servings have also become part of the post-Beryl coping strategies. Also it is quite convenient when you are juggling a demanding job with parenting, and rushing around in the morning, to just give the children $2 or $3 to buy snacks at school. Unfortunately, most school tuck shops only offer ultra-processed snacks and sugary sodas. The result of these challenges, I fear, is an increase in the already epidemic rates of lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The KFC sign looms large at the entrance of Akamwesi, a mall in Mpererwe neighbourhood in Kampala, daring you to pass by without stopping at the drive-through. Many of the children and parents visiting the mall have never gone beyond the borders of . They certainly don’t know about the Great Depression that inspired Colonel Sanders to start one of the first American international food chains. All they know is that the three letters KFC represent all things sophisticated. In every mall and every market, there is fast food for every pocket. As one of the more expensive options, KFC is considered a treat. It is the place Kampala’s families go to celebrate birthdays and baptisms. It is the children’s reward when they get a good school report. In fact, they are hoping their parents take them for Christmas at KFC. “Mom, do you know that some people pack KFC for school lunch,” my 14-year-old daughter, who attends a school between Mpererwe and the more upscale neighbourhood of Acacia, tells me. She says that on the days they do not pack KFC, they pack food from Café Javas, an east African fast-food chain selling everything from fried breakfasts to burgers. It is Friday evening, and I am only half-listening as I struggle to do the weekend shopping at Acacia mall while steering her and her brother away from the restaurants suggesting that life would be so much easier if we bought chips and chicken and ate in front of a Netflix movie. When we get home, I find my husband has already slaughtered one of the free range chickens in our back yard. I hope the aroma of chicken slow boiled for hours and served with fresh vegetables from the market will triumph over the allure of fast food. When I was growing up, we literally ate everything. There was not much awareness about what was healthy and what was unhealthy. Today, what children can and can’t eat it is a constant conversation – in school, at home, in the news. My daughter loves ice-cream and chocolates. Her grandparents are very indulgent, and I often have to put my foot down. I try to rationalise the amount she eats, but it is difficult. What I hate most are lollipops. They are sticky, messy and she keeps them in her mouth for hours. Sometimes I give in because it is tiring to constantly be on top of this. As working professionals, it is not always possible to do everything from scratch, such as paneer (homemade cottage cheese). However, a surrounding synthetic paneer had me concerned for days, as we source store-bought paneer on a regular basis. It also does not help that when we go shopping all the treats and chocolates are right at the checkout. My daughter often accompanies me to the store and asks me to buy chocolates or some other packaged snack. Even things like peanut chikki (like a brittle) that I grew up eating are highly processed today. If I say no, she sulks a little, saying I always say no. The rule in our home is no refined sugar, no fizzy drinks. That means no biscuits, which are basically made of maida (refined flour) and palm oil. My doctor tells me it sticks to children’s teeth and gives them cavities. But when someone else offers them, she goes nuts. I try to read the ingredients on the packaging, and anything that lists more than 10, I don’t buy. Sometimes it feels like we have zero control over what we are putting on to our kid’s plate and that sense of helplessness is very frustrating. Moreover, there are very few options available for wholesome snacks in the Indian market and they are very pricey. So, economically speaking, it is also a constant challenge to ensure my child is eating healthy and balanced meals all the time. My son says it all started when he saw his friends eating things he knew he wasn’t allowed to. One bite and he was hooked. He was probably nine. The Indonesian noodles were one of the tastiest things he had ever eaten, he told me. Having heard and read what these foods were doing to the health of young people around the world, I was not happy. But that initial taste piqued his curiosity and he started trying to introduce to the weekly shop – by stealth. Our nearby mall was the crime scene. During one visit, he snuck a pack of beef-flavoured noodles from either Singapore or South Korea, burying it under other items. I was too distracted to notice. He repeated the move during another shopping trip. This time I was keen enough to notice not one, but three packets of UPFs in the trolley. He had to return them to the shelves, much to the consternation of other shoppers queueing at the checkout. But just removing such items from the shopping basket is not enough. What do you replace them with? So many exotic treats that appeal to children carry health risks. I sat in a recent media briefing where an eye doctor said that many young people presenting with eyesight issues are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. “They come for an eye checkup but unknown to their parents, diabetes is the root cause of the eyesight issues,” she said. “Junk food is at the centre of the declining health among young people in While local markets abound with healthy foods such as tubers and traditional vegetables, it has been a constant battle getting my son, now 14, to eat them. Happily, he is slowly adjusting to healthy eating habits. “It comes with age,” he joked recently. “Junk food is really appealing but it doesn’t help much. You could eat all you want but after about an hour you’ll have to eat [stiff dough made of maize flour] and [a dish made using greens] – to fill you up.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But good things have still been happening in vaccine research and the development of new and improved treatments for some of the most intractable illnesses. A target to protect 86 million girls against cervical cancer by the end of 2025 was achieved ahead of schedule, boosting hopes among experts that cervical cancer can be Gavi, the vaccine alliance, launched its human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme in 2014, when vaccine coverage in Africa was just 4%. By the end of 2022, it was only 15% – but scientists had discovered that to the two doses originally used. That would make it simpler to deliver vaccination programmes, and stretch supplies twice as far. In 2023, Gavi announced its ambitious and a concerted push saw coverage in Africa rise. By the end of 2024 it was at 44% – higher than Europe’s 38%. In November, Dr Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s chief executive, credited “countries, partners, civil society and communities” for reaching the 86m target early, and “driving major global progress towards eliminating one of the deadliest diseases affecting women”. Cervical cancer remains widespread and deadly in poorer parts of the world – 85% of new cases – and a woman dies from the disease every two minutes. But a jab against the virus can avert 17.4 deaths for every 1,000 children vaccinated, according to Gavi, meaning the 86m vaccinations will prevent an estimated 1.4m cervical cancer deaths. After successful clinical trials, the first new type of malaria treatment in decades is to seek regulatory approval. GanLum, from pharma company Novartis, outperformed the standard treatment by demonstrating a cure rate of 99.2% compared with 96.7%. Crucially, it should also be effective against malaria parasites that have developed resistance to artemisinin, a component of the current standard treatment. is a growing concern. In the 1990s, , then the standard malaria treatment, led to millions of deaths, says Dr George Jagoe of the Medicines for Malaria Venture. The prospect of an antimalarial such as GanLum gives a “sense of relief”, he said at the ’s annual meeting, like “having a fire extinguisher” ready to use. Researchers also hope GanLum will be more effective at stopping transmission, because of how it affects parasites at certain stages of their life cycle. “GanLum could represent the biggest advance in malaria treatment for decades,” says Dr Abdoulaye Djimdé, professor of parasitology and mycology at the University of Science, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali, who was involved in the drug’s development. “Drug resistance is a growing threat to Africa, so new treatment options can’t come a moment too soon.” Cape Verde, Mauritius and Seychelles became the to officially eliminate measles and rubella. The milestone came despite a surge in measles cases worldwide, with an estimated 11m infections in 2024. In November, the Americas region because of outbreaks in Canada, while the US is facing its worst outbreak in decades. The three African countries’ success was described as “a major public health achievement”. “It shows what’s possible when countries put prevention first and make vaccines a priority,” says Dr Mohamed Janabi, the World “We must build on this success so that every child in Africa can grow up healthy and protected.” Twenty-one Pacific island countries also eliminated measles and rubella this year. The status means they have interrupted endemic transmission for more than three years, and also have surveillance systems to rapidly pick up and contain any cases coming into the country. Botswana and Rwanda have achieved 95% coverage with measles and rubella vaccination, the benchmark needed to interrupt transmission. , with a WHO report finding nearly 59 million lives had been saved by the measles vaccine since 2000. A drug described as a potential “gamechanger” for the HIV epidemic arrived in sub-Saharan Africa Lenacapavir, given as an injection twice a year, can almost completely prevent HIV infection. It was approved by US regulators in June and recommended by the WHO in July. Manufacturer Gilead has signed agreements with six manufacturers of generic drugs, allowing them to produce cheaper versions for use in 120 countries. Those will be provided at about $40 (£30) for each patient for a year under deals struck with Unitaid and the Global Fund. Until that production comes online, Gilead has committed to providing lenacapavir at no profit for up to two million people over the next two years. In November, . Rollout is expected to begin in early 2026. Campaigners say access needs to go further – poor communities in countries excluded from Gilead’s generic agreements will still struggle to afford the drug, at a list price of $28,218 to treat one person for a year. The drug will need to be rolled out at vast scale to turn the tide of new infections. And funding for HIV services is fragile. Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund, said the introduction in low- and middle-income countries “nearly simultaneously with high-income countries […] alone is a breakthrough, as previous drugs for HIV prevention have taken an average of five years to become available in these settings after evidence of their efficacy is first known”. Since it was named in 1882, tuberculosis has killed and remains the world’s leading killer from infectious disease. But treatment options are advancing at pace. Four vaccines are stages; easier to use tests, including could boost cure rates and shorten the time needed to treat TB. A new antibiotic, sorfequiline, showed stronger action than existing treatments in trial results presented at the Union World Conference on Lung Health in November. “Science continues to surge forward, to the benefit of healthcare systems, people with TB, their families and their communities,” says Dr Mel Spigelman, president of TB Alliance, which developed the drug. The advance builds on a new regimen for people with more complicated forms of TB, introduced in 2019, which itself shortened treatment from more than 18 months to six. Replacing one drug in that regimen with sorfequiline could shorten treatment further, with more trials planned for 2026. “Goals that once seemed wholly aspirational, such as the eradication of TB, are made increasingly possible because of advancements like sorfequiline,” says Dr Rod Dawson of the University of Cape Town Lung Institute. “But we have a lot of work ahead of us and cannot stop until TB is no longer a threat.”",Kat Lay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maia, nine, and her brothers, aged 11 and seven, huddle by a campfire. Their mother, Gisel, rummages through bags that smell of rotten fruit and meat. Situated at the northern end of Argentinian Patagonia, 100km (60 miles) from – one of the world’s largest fossil gas reserves – children here roam amid twisted metal, glass and rubbish spread over five hectares (12 acres). The horizon is waste. ?” Maia asks, using the local slang term for searching out cans, wires or sellable items. She grabs sticks to open bags, looking for toys, false nails, or items to sell. She is saving to buy her mother a gift. Her brothers sit by the fire; the youngest sleepy, the eldest angry. near me,” says Gisel. Slipping on a glove full of holes to dig through the bags, she expects the supermarket truck before noon and hopes for canned or frozen food. Perhaps they will eat meat again, after washing and frying it. From atop the rubbish mountain the dirt tracks and tin-and-wood shacks of her neighbourhood, Manzana 34, can be seen. About 400 families live there, 300 metres from the piles of refuse. For many, the dump is not just a permanent health and environmental hazard, but also a means of survival: they find food, school supplies, furniture and construction materials. In Neuquén and hundreds of Argentine towns, live within 300 metres of rubbish dumps in households where families cannot meet their basic needs. Children here often go hungry, drop out of school or finish without having learned the essentials, according to the . In many of them, children scavenge daily – a source of revenue in a country where under 17 live below the poverty line. “Children who live or work in landfills are invisible,” says Sebastián Medina, chief of staff at the After inspecting 11 open dumps, his team found no government protocols in place to protect these children, whose living conditions contravene the UN , which is constitutionally recognised by Argentina. that municipal, provincial and national governments establish care centres for children whose parents work in dumps, and develop plans to close the sites and provide alternative employment. When asked whether specific policies exist, they cited “different care programmes, such as early childhood centres” as already in place. The provincial government of Neuquén declined to comment on the landfill beside Manzana 34. n the absence of solutions, the problem goes on. On a spring afternoon in Manzana 34, the heat presses down and the few trees offer no shade. The acrid smell of the dump drifts in on the wind, as Gisel drinks mate at her neighbour Johana’s home. Johana has four children between the ages of nine and 15. The women’s houses are constructed from recycled materials: sheets of metal, cardboard, plastic and demolition debris. Beds are wooden pallets. Last night, Gisel and her partner searched through rubbish from midnight until 7am, while their children were looked after by her sister. “It was a good day,” she says. Selling aluminium cans earned enough for noodles and tomato puree. “Yesterday, I only had two tins of tuna from the rubbish tip. The children went to bed hungry,” she says. She found clothes to sell at a flea market. With the money, she will buy cold cuts from a neighbourhood WhatsApp group: “There are neighbours who sell everything they find in large quantities and in good condition. It’s like a small online market.” Faced with the shortcomings of the state, charities and community organisations are stepping in to ensure a better future for the local children. Amid rough gravel roads, a patch of green synthetic grass stands out: the football pitch of Club Deportivo La Colonia. Until February, it was bare dirt. The municipality of Neuquén provided turf and a fence. Four parents founded the club to keep children off the streets. From 6pm to 9pm, 140 children play and eat a snack – often their only evening meal. Three hundred metres away, the dump smokes on the plateau. On windy days, the fence catches clouds of plastic bags, and when the smoke thickens, football is cancelled. When there is no wind, the smell of burnt cable can drift over. Scrap collectors burn insulation to extract the copper inside. “The worst is when the rubbish explodes – the smoke burns your throat,” say neighbours. Living near poorly managed landfills poses . These sites release toxic leachate that contaminates and produce gases such as methane and CO , contributing to the climate crisis. , including respiratory, skin, gastrointestinal infections, congenital disabilities and . Exposure to heavy metals and organic compounds can cause toxicity and long-term health problems. Nazarena Bauso, a researcher at the UCA, says that poverty is not merely income-based but also reflects living conditions. “A child exposed to a rubbish dump and who doesn’t eat well gets sick more often. If they share a bed and lack space to study or play, they don’t develop privacy or intellect. If they drop out of school to work at the dump, they never know other realities, such as aspiring to a formal job,” she says. “When they take them to the rubbish dump, parents don’t realise all this because hunger is more urgent.” he little monkeys,” Johana points from the pitch toward the dump. That’s what they call the children who climb lorries to grab expired goods dumped by supermarkets. “Once, a child lost four fingers. A few years ago, another was run over and killed. The lorries don’t check if there are children there,” she says. Until recently, Johana scavenged with her children. “Thank God my partner got a job at a sawmill and we don’t go any more,” she says. Children suffer most from existing alongside the dump as it affects everything: the air they breathe, the food they eat, and the dangers it creates where they play. “They have cuts from glass, bronchospasms, gastrointestinal diseases and skin allergies,” says Dr Ignacio Veltri, who runs a health post in a container near the dump. Veltri and student volunteers from the National University of Comahue set up the post to offer medical care, vaccinations and check-ups. “Many parents bring their children to the dump because they have nowhere else to leave them. When there is such scarcity, it’s better not to judge but to help,” he says. Despite the vulnerabilities they face, Maia, her siblings and Johana’s children have big plans. Their mothers love to talk about dreams: a stable job, happiness for their children. Gisel wants to leave the dump and open a bakery. She shows photos of decorated cakes. Maia also wants to be a baker. The other children dream of being footballers, architects or police officers. When the dump swelters under the sun, whipped by the Patagonian wind, Maia and her siblings stay home in the neighbourhood below. The streets are deserted. Within an hour, a yellow weather alert will be issued due to strong Patagonian winds that amplify the environmental problem. On the plateau, the storm begins: copper-coloured dust and flying plastic bags shrouding those who scavenge. Two thin boys, 11 and 14, struggle forward with burlap sacks heavy with their day’s haul. Some would say they have had a good day. For Maia, a good day is finding false nails or toys. A bad one was when her mother pricked her hand with a syringe. Still, she prefers to talk about her dream – shared with her mother – of apple pies, sweet white cream and the scent of vanilla.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/07/genocide-sudan-zamzam-camp-timeline,‘They slaughtered us like animals’: the inside story of how one of the biggest atrocities of the Sudan war unfolded in Zamzam,2025-08-07T04:00:26.000Z,"As the UK prepared to host a global summit on bringing peace to Sudan, the RSF paramilitary began a ‘genocidal’ massacre in Zamzam refugee camp. But when reports emerged of the killings, London held its silence. For the first time, using intelligence reports and witness testimony, we piece together what occurred during the April atrocity – and why it was not stopped At just 22 years old, nurse Hanadi Dawood was an expert in the myriad ways poverty could kill. She knew straight away if a child would last the day; you learn such skills in a place where an infant dies Hanadi ran a small health centre in Zamzam, a sprawling displacement camp in Sudan’s Darfur region, the heart of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe. Her clinic was already busy before breakfast on 11 April. But there was every chance it would get a lot busier. Outside Zamzam, the notorious Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group was massing on three sides, preparing for a possible ground assault. Some believed the RSF might hold off. Even for a group , Zamzam, they felt, was too soft a target. Its 500,000 residents – predominantly women and children – were virtually defenceless. They were also starving to death. “Inside Zamzam you’d find one of – if not – most vulnerable populations on the planet,” says a UN war crimes investigator, requesting anonymity. Even so, soon after 8am heavy artillery jolted Zamzam. Drones buzzed above. The offensive had begun. Attacking on multiple fronts, RSF units breached the camp’s defensive berm. Near its southern entrance, up to 50 teenage girls sat staring at their phones. Witnesses saw them being bundled into RSF pickup trucks, and driven away. None have been seen since. Two hundred metres east, 30 RSF pickups entered Ahmadai neighbourhood. Sixty homes belonging to the ethnic Zaghawa tribe were set ablaze. Women were shot as they fled. Six stayed, and burned alive as a consequence. Five minutes north of Ahmadai, Fatima Bakhit was lying beside her husband, two sons and her uncle, who was blind. Through a fence, the pregnant 25-year-old could peer into the courtyard of Zamzam’s last functioning international clinic, run by Four RSF Toyota Hiluxes smashed through the gate to the clinic’s compound. Bakhit watched the medics scramble into two foxholes, the subterranean hideaways residents had dug to survive artillery attacks. Five staff squeezed inside one, four into the other. [slaves]!” shouted a fighter. A doctor, injured by shelling, emerged. He was shot in the stomach and tumbled back into the foxhole, wounded but alive. Two more shots. “The others were told to lie on their backs. They were killed,” says Hafiza*, another witness. The occupants of the second foxhole were lined up at gunpoint. They too were executed. Bakhit’s husband was shot dead. More gunfire followed. Her five-year-old son was struck in the back. “Parts of his body fell in my hand,” says Bakhit. Her other son, aged three, crawled towards her, spattered red with the blood of his dead brother. Bakhit was shot in the right leg and hand. “Hey! I told you not to shoot women and children,” yelled an RSF officer. He turned to Bakhit. “Your men are Stand up!” Bakhit’s blind uncle stumbled. He was killed. The RSF entered the Sheikh Farah Quranic school next door to the clinic. It was packed with students and residents seeking shelter. Among them was Sumaya Adam. “We hid, but the attackers dragged the men out.” Bakhit watched at least 15 children and men being led outside. “They got them standing in line and shot them all dead.” The killing spree, by turns methodical and frenzied, would last another 70 hours. Until now, what unfolded at Zamzam has largely remained a mystery: many of those who witnessed the atrocities were killed. However, testimony from scores of survivors along with intelligence and UN sources offers an intricate insight into one of the most shocking episodes of Sudan’s Pieced together, the accounts portray an ethnic slaughter of such magnitude that the Zamzam attack is likely to have been the second biggest war crime of Sudan’s catastrophic conflict, behind a in West Darfur nearly two years earlier. Official estimates indicate up to 400 people were killed in Zamzam. A committee set up to investigate the true number has so far identified more than 1,500 deaths. Committee member Mohammed Sharif says the final figure will be significantly higher: hundreds are yet to be accounted for. A Darfur atrocity expert who has interviewed scores of Zamzam survivors is “certain” more than 2,000 died. But the RSF wanted one resident dead more than any other. From the start, paramilitaries identified Hanadi as a priority target. Senior RSF figures were incensed by footage of the young nurse beseeching Zamzam’s residents to stand their ground. An extraordinary plot involving undercover agents, bribes and plain-clothed assassins had been hatched to silence her. “They hate women,” said Manahel, a friend. “Especially ones that stand up to them.” At about the moment that the staff at Relief International were executed, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) forwarded details of a press briefing about a forthcoming conference. In four days’ time, on 15 April, nearby Lancaster House would host a global summit aimed at bringing peace to Sudan. The date was seared on the Sudanese psyche: the of the war between the military and RSF that had The briefing made no reference to the nightmare evolving in Zamzam. Yet real-time updates were already provoking panic among Sudan’s diaspora. UK officials began receiving “atrocity alerts”. Two days before the Zamzam offensive, sources say the UN security council was briefed that a large-scale assault on the camp was imminent. had told the council in person that Zamzam was at risk, one of five face-to-face warnings it shared in 2025. , at Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab, says: “We made concerted efforts to warn the international community that a full-scale assault on Zamzam was both imminent and inevitable.” Less than 24 hours before the attack, sources say FCDO officials were taken aside by concerned experts at an event at the Chatham House research institute in London and told of fears of an impending ethnic massacre at Zamzam. An attack on Sudan’s largest displacement camp was the scenario everybody dreaded. Two decades earlier, it had been conceived as a haven for the ethnic African tribes being slaughtered by Arab militias – the same militias that would become the RSF. Few Darfuri families had avoided the genocidal violence that began, Hanadi chose nursing because of the suffering she saw as a child. The violence has rarely subsided since. Zamzam expanded with each spasm of fighting. Now 4 miles (7km) long, its proportions did not prevent it being surrounded by the RSF. Besieged since June 2024, food was beyond scarce. Residents were forced to eat leaves to survive. In August that year, famine was “There was a moral obligation for the London conference to There was, however, a complication. Among the 20 countries invited to the conference was the UAE, one of the west’s most coveted economic partners. Although the UAE “firmly rejects any claims of providing arms or military equipment” to the RSF, allegations to the contrary are . Critics allege it is plausible that weaponry linked to the Gulf state was used at Zamzam. The UAE says the claims are unfounded. Campaigners, though, sensed a unique opportunity. The timing of the assault, on the eve of the London conference, would surely persuade the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to call out the UAE. “Lammy could have used his leverage to tell his Emirati counterpart to cancel the outrageous attack on a displacement camp: ‘If you don’t, you are not invited to London,’” says a UN expert. Such a warning would have had merit. Sources reveal Emirati officials are in “constant contact” with the , among others. Sources, in fact, reveal the UAE had already moved to prevent another massacre. Sources say in June 2024, Abu Dhabi called Hemedti and “told him to stop” a planned assault on El Fasher, after the UN security council introduced a demanding the RSF cease fighting around Zamzam and El Fasher, the neighbouring city. In Sudan, the RSF continued to push deeper into Zamzam. House to house searches were carried out. Occupants were summarily executed. Tayseer Abdalla saw two of her aunts and their young daughters killed inside their home near the central market. Mariam watched the militia enter her sister’s house. “They dragged her out and killed her. They slaughtered us like animals,” she says. Ruqayyah and her family were leaving when the RSF entered their home. Wordlessly, they opened fire. Ruqayyah was able to limp away. Three others were left to die. Meanwhile, across south Zamzam, RSF fighters offered bribes for clues to Hanadi’s whereabouts. “They were offering huge amounts,” says Ismail Idris, a relative who lives in the British town of Reading. Kaltouma, another camp resident, describes the fighters arriving at her door. “They were shouting: ‘Where is she? Where is she?’” For all the efforts to locate her, Hanadi was often directly in front of them. “She was present on the frontlines, treating, bandaging,” says friend Mohamed Afandy. The casualties mounted. Defended by a ragtag mix of volunteer resistance units and – whose remit was to protect civilians – the camp was hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered. About 200 RSF pickups had attacked Zamzam, seven times the number defending it. By midday, the RSF had crossed the B26 highway, entering the main camp. A call had gone out for civilians to defend Zamzam. “Hanadi was among the first to answer,” says Muhammad Effendi, a resident. Hanadi headed to the frontline armed with a modest kitchen knife. Up against hi-tech drones and guided bombs, Hanadi’s father, Juma, says her unit repelled at least one attack. By early afternoon, Hanadi’s unit was pinned down near the central market. Witnesses describe the nurse laying down her knife to tend to the wounded. Mohammed Sharif, 27, ran past her position under ferocious fire. “I saw her saving injured people, giving them medicine.” Hope rested with a sizeable Sudanese military garrison seven miles away in El Fasher. If soldiers were sent, Zamzam would be saved. “We were waiting for support from El Fasher but didn’t get it. We still don’t know why,” says Mohamed Adam, a teacher. The central market was not the only place under pressure. Mustafa Bora saw RSF fighters heading for the camp’s community kitchen. Bora sprinted there, imploring everyone to evacuate. Hasanat Musa – seven months pregnant – and her friend, Nana Idris, refused to budge. “Why are you cooking for slaves?” asked fighters as they stormed the kitchen, smashing pots. Musa’s late-stage pregnancy offered no protection. She and Idris were executed. The attackers closed in on Hanadi’s new position: a makeshift health centre north of the market. Hisham Mohamed was fighting alongside her. “She told us: ‘Die with honour. I will be here until the end.’” Hanadi may not have noticed the men approaching. Only when alongside her did they reveal their weapons. She was shot at close range. “Their operatives infiltrated the camp disguised in civilian clothing to carry out her assassination,” says Juma. Chaotic footage shows her being carried by friends to another rudimentary clinic. A soundtrack of gunfire is constant. By now, much of Zamzam was hurrying north. Shells fell on fleeing families. RSF snipers climbed trees, picking them off. Mariam witnessed children flattened by a shell as they fled. “Nobody will ever bury them,” she says. Others described leaping over body parts. Bleeding children lay waiting for help that never came. Hundreds hid underground in cramped, sweltering foxholes. “They were quickly filled with women and children,” says one witness, Adouma Ali. RSF death squads combed the area. Anyone found in a foxhole was shot. Further south, Bakhit lay frozen beside her dead husband and child. At 3pm a neighbour attempted to reach her but was shot in the hip. Darkness fell. The RSF retreated. “Suddenly it was quiet. People emerged from foxholes, shellshocked,” says Ali. As the cacophony of gunfire subsided, children could be heard crying in the dark. Next, the scraping of shovels as bodies were placed in shallow graves. Bakhit laid her five-year-old son and husband in an enlarged foxhole. In Zamzam’s southern neighbourhoods, the night brought terror. Fighters wandered devastated streets, looking for women to abduct. In Hamaday and Karaba districts, they began raping. Elsewhere, residents headed towards Saloma, Zamzam’s northern neighbourhood. Many passed the makeshift clinic where volunteers were battling to save Hanadi. Back in London, as night fell, the mood among humanitarians was febrile. Attempts to cajole FCDO officials into making a statement on Zamzam ahead of the conference had foundered. “Everybody was raging, asking: ‘Where’s Lammy?’” recalls a prominent human rights expert. They could not even pressure Sudanese diplomats attending the conference: none had been invited. Details of the atrocities, delivered to western policymakers, were politely dismissed. “Evidence of genocide was met with: ‘Thank you for sharing. Keep us updated,’” says a prominent humanitarian. ” on Sudan – meaning it leads the UN security council’s activities on Africa’s third-largest country – nothing happened. Many felt the timing of the offensive before the conference was deliberate. “It was beyond provocative. The RSF – and its alleged backers, the UAE – were saying: “Go on, let’s see what you can do,” says the UN investigator. Zamzam shuddered again under a ferocious artillery bombardment. One resident counted 250 shells. Tens of thousands of residents began moving towards Saloma. Leaving her home in Jafalo, Nafisa encountered devastation. “I saw 18 dead bodies, including a child killed by shelling.” Drones targeted main roads. At 11am, Bora saw a girl staggering around Labado neighbourhood. Shrapnel had speared her face. She had lost an eye. Qismah, an aid worker, watched adolescent fighters targeting whoever they came across. “They didn’t even try to communicate. They just shot at anyone.” Across Zamzam, a huge game of cat and mouse unfolded. Jamal, a health worker, and his family were near the almost deserted Jamal ran into a house, joining 50 other people hiding inside alongside a flock of sheep. He peered into the street. Residents were being dragged outside. “I saw them kill six civilians; five young men and someone over 80 years old.” The RSF came closer. More shots reverberated outside. The door swung open. “They entered, saw the sheep, took them and forgot who was in the house. But they were killing anyone, even children. My cousin was killed that way,” says Jamal. Some people headed east, seeking refuge in a nearby valley. Halima and her three children ran there, pursued by RSF pickups. They had no chance. “Before they spoke, they shot my 16-year-old son in the head. I attacked the person who fired, but four men grabbed me: two by the legs, two by the hands. The man who killed my son raped me,” says Halima. Then they raped her teenage daughters. “I could hear their screams, especially my youngest, who was 13. After an hour and a half, [the RSF] left.” Halima laid clothes over her dead son. She carried her youngest daughter, who could not stand, to Saloma. Some crimes were thwarted by women who, inspired by Hanadi, had joined self-defence units. Fatima Ramadan was being pursued by the RSF when self-defence recruits “no older than girls” intervened. “The girls gave us advice and guidance on how to get out.” By mid afternoon, the central market was ablaze. Bleaker news followed: attempts to save Hanadi had proved futile. At about 3pm, the nurse was buried in a secret location to prevent the RSF desecrating her body. Ammunition, fuel and food supplies were perilously low. Joint forces commanders told relatives they were contemplating a full withdrawal. Reports began to surface of children being executed. In one account, RSF had converged on a straw hut in west Zamzam. Several infants were hidden inside. Fighters stood in the doorway and “opened fire on the children”. Nightfall prompted a procession of people to move silently towards Saloma. The joint forces retreated to El Fasher. The failure of the Sudanese army to help Zamzam hurt. One theory suggests the military sat back and allowed the RSF to rampage, assuming the politicians gathering in London would have little choice but to censure the militia and its Gulf ally. The weekend began with the firm expectation Lammy would issue an early, robust statement on Zamzam. WhatsApp exchanges between atrocity experts and FCDO officials urged the foreign secretary to act. Although officials “acknowledged” the dire situation in Darfur, for the first time humanitarians began to think that they might do nothing about it. “Zamzam obviously framed the conference. Were they deliberately trying to ignore it?” says a source in frequent contact with Lammy’s advisers. As the hours ticked by, and the litany of RSF brutalities grew ever longer, a decision was seemingly made by the UK government to say nothing. No emergency meeting was convened; no face-to-face with groups collating evidence of war crimes from Zamzam. Repeatedly, officials were told they risked ignoring possible genocide. Messages between advisers to the UN security council compared the attack to Bosniak Muslim men and boys were slaughtered by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. Did Lammy pressure his Emirati counterpart over Zamzam? Did he even raise Zamzam? The FCDO declined to comment. “Ultimately – by pen and by sword – the RSF was doing its thing in Zamzam while the UAE did its thing in London. Both components were working to keep a genocidal project going,” says a prominent human rights analyst. Tempers flared. “At one point officials felt the burgeoning atrocity wasn’t worth contacting Lammy for,” the analyst claims. The UAE told the Guardian: “We categorically reject any claims of providing any form of support to either warring party since the onset of the civil war.” At a time delayed for colleagues in the US, campaigners met online to strategise how to challenge the inertia. Journalists received details of “genocidal” violence. Darkness came with no response from the UK. Similarly, no emergency UN security council meeting had been called. Those monitoring the atrocities in Zamzam from London were consumed with helplessness. “Help! This is hell!” read one WhatsApp message. Then, something: Lammy sent a tweet. “Shocking reports” from Darfur, he wrote, giving impetus to the impending conference. “All sides must commit to the protection of civilians.” Daybreak saw thousands huddled around Saloma Square, northern Zamzam. Hundreds more squeezed inside the grand mosque for protection. Shortly after 8am, RSF fighters flooded the square. Those sheltering inside the mosque were ordered out. “The RSF began dividing people based on their ethnic groups and physical strength. They started with young men,” says Ibrahim. The men were told to stand in line. It is not known how many were massacred. “A large number were executed by gunfire,” says Ibrahim. Elderly men and women were split into groups. Individuals identified as Zaghawa and linked to the joint forces were, he says, brutally beaten. Community leaders and teachers were humiliated. Unrestrained violence was reserved for another young nurse, called Mihrab. Upon finding surgical gloves in her bag, she was beaten repeatedly for treating Women and children, say witnesses, were separated based on physicality; those deemed sufficiently sturdy were forced to walk livestock to Kabkabiya, 105 miles away. Testimony then describes eight shells thumping into Saloma Square. Fighters charged the crowd from east and west. Amid the pandemonium, Bakhit lost her three-year-old. Panicking, she limped south to find him. Bodies littered the landscape. “Vehicles smelt, bodies were still inside,” says Bakhit. “An RSF commander said: ‘Throw those bodies in the Satellite images confirm widespread destruction. As Zamzam burned, RSF units started shelling El Fasher. The camp was now in full retreat. At 1.45pm the received a message from colleagues in Darfur. “Zamzam under the control of the RSF,” it read. Women trapped in the camp became increasingly vulnerable. At least eight were raped that afternoon. Others were abducted. Eleven were reportedly trafficked 19 miles south. Families were asked to pay a ransom equivalent to £6,000 for their release. Back in Saloma, gigantic crowds were hemmed in by the RSF. “Severe shortages of food and water led to the deaths of many children,” says Jamal Abdullah, a teacher. When eventually allowed to leave, more than fled Zamzam. Tens of thousands walked 30 miles to Tawila. Among them was Hanadi’s family. It was a hellish journey. Women and girls were raped at checkpoints. Men walked away from the road to avoid execution. But the main killer was starvation or thirst. Sources estimate hundreds may have died making the journey. Ethnic prejudices underscored the enmity. Marchers were asked in Zaghawa: “How are you?” Anyone who responded was beaten. Bakhit, unable to find her toddler in Zamzam, joined the throng to Tawila. She felt numb. “I had lost my husband, my children. I felt nothing. Not even hunger.” Multiple accounts, though, detail extraordinary acts of kindness: thousands of children and elderly people were carried by strangers. By most metrics the London conference on Sudan flopped, torpedoed by bickering between the Emiratis and opposing Arab states. The concluding conference ignored Darfur’s horror. Zamzam was not even mentioned. “It was like they pretended it never happened,” says a UN source. UK officials say the conference “substantively advanced international coherence” on Sudan. Lammy did not dedicate 15 April to Sudan, finding time to secretly meet his Israeli counterpart. The FCDO would not say for how long, why or where the meeting occurred. “Why wasn’t every diary slot that day devoted to civilian protection in Sudan?” says a diplomat. The conference also sidelined the most important group in Sudan: its women. says: “Sudanese women form the backbone of their communities. They smuggle food and medicine, risking their lives. Yet we have no presence in policy and political settings.” Abdallah Abugarda, of the UK’s Darfur Diaspora Association, believes Zamzam proves the UK chose the Emirates’ economic muscle over human rights. Of 30,000 Darfuris in his organisation, he says 4,500 know a friend or relative killed in the attack. Leeds-based Suleiman Yousif lost eight family members. “They were murdered together in one location,” he says. On 17 April, as the enormity of the massacre started to become clear, the UN security council a statement, saying the attack carried the “hallmarks of ethnic cleansing”. He has released no official statement on Sudan since then. An FCDO spokesperson, referring to the Zamzam attacks as “abhorrent”, said: “The UK and foreign secretary are at the forefront of efforts to keep the conflict on the international agenda.” Already the slaughter feels like a footnote. An all-party parliamentary meeting on Sudan after the offensive provoked dismay. “None of the speakers mentioned what happened in Zamzam,” says Abugardh. A subsequent request to hold a special session on the attack was, he claims, rejected. Meanwhile, an unpublished UN report on atrocities in Sudan contains, say sources, “half a line reference to what occurred at Zamzam”. Thirty-seven days after Zamzam fell, the UK declared its desire for a Back in Darfur, Hanadi is still celebrated. Her killers, however, will probably never face justice. Her former home stands largely deserted: Hanadi’s family are split between Tawila, Chad and their original North Darfur village. UN investigators believe such “deliberate displacement” was the motive for the attack. Others believe Zamzam was ransacked so the RSF could pay fighters. Residents are adamant the attackers wanted to “exterminate” them. Sporadically, cheering news comes from Darfur. After 18 days trawling Tawila for her toddler, a chance encounter with an injured woman revealed Bakhit’s son was safe, 12 miles away in Shagra. They were reunited in May. But another ethnic slaughter is looming. El Fasher – with a population of over a million – is surrounded, starving and under attack from the RSF. As the fighting intensifies, new heroes like Hanadi will inevitably emerge. They, too, will be buried in secret graves, legends in a war with no end.",Mark Townsend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet climate change and industrial exploitation are pushing this ocean-based culture to its limits. Coastal villages around Toliara, a city in southern Madagascar, host tens of thousands of the , who make a living from small-scale fishing on the ocean. For centuries, they have launched , small boats carved from single tree trunks, every day into the turquoise shallows to catch tuna, barracuda and grouper. “We rely solely on the ocean,” says Soa Nomeny, a woman from a small island off the south-west coast called Nosy Ve. “Whatever we catch today, we eat today. If we catch nothing, we don’t eat.” A boat near lines of seaweed, which has become a main source of income for Ambatomilo village as warmer seas, bleached reefs and erratic weather accelerate the decline of local fish populations That dependence is becoming precarious for the 600 or so residents of Nosy Ve. Michel “Goff” Strogoff, a former shark hunter turned conservationist from the Vezo hamlet of Andavadoaka, says fish populations began collapsing in the 1990s and have declined sharply over the past decade. Rising sea temperatures, coral bleaching and reef degradation have destroyed breeding grounds, while erratic weather linked to warming oceans has shortened fishing seasons. “There’s no abundance near shore any more,” he says. “We’re forced to paddle farther.” Soa Nomeny, wearing traditional sunblock, prepares the family’s main meal of rice and fish or octopus. The Vezo only eat that day’s catch, ensuring their meals are connected to the sea’s bounty In Nosy Ve, fish are often cooked with tomato, onion and garlic; salted sardines are laid out to dry before being sold in Andavadoaka; Soa Nomeny applies , traditional sunblock made from ground , a fragrant bark; and the catch is taken to market from Bevohitse village by zebu-drawn cart, the main form of transport in remote areas Local fishers echo the same concern. “There are simply too many nets out there,” says Hosoanay Natana, who now travels hours beyond traditional grounds to make a viable catch for him and his fellow fishermen. Industrial trawlers – Malagasy and foreign – often enter near-shore waters despite a national ban on the ships coming within two nautical miles (3.7km) of the coast. Weak enforcement means violations are common, leaving small-scale fishers with dwindling returns. The environmental group Blue Ventures, which has worked in the region for two decades, reports that by more than half since the 1990s. The organisation that help communities set their own fishing rules, restore reefs and look for alternative ways to make a living. Some of the most promising of these include imposing temporary closures, which have allowed octopus stocks to rebound, and the new practice of seaweed farming, which acts as a commercial buffer against overfishing and climate shocks. Hosoanay Natana tightening the net around a school of barracuda. Divers direct boats to form a circle with the net. Once the fish are trapped, the divers retrieve them and bring them to the boat, ensuring more sustainable fishing Even young children must help get the catch in Farther down the coast, the village of Ambatomilo, known locally as Seaweed Village, has embraced this shift. Overseen by its LMMA committee, it is among several communities cultivating seaweed as a supplementary income for fishers whose traditional grounds are overexploited. Families lay freshly harvested seaweed out to dry before selling it to local cooperatives. Fabricé and his wife, Olive, who began farming five years ago, harvest every couple of weeks. “The market pays around 1,500 ariary [25p] per kilo,” says Olive, spreading red seaweed across bamboo racks. Depending on the season, families can produce up to a tonne a month, offering significant extra income that helps cushion households’ living standards when fishing falters. “We still depend on fish for daily needs,” she says, “but the seaweed helps us plan ahead.” Seaweed farming is now one of Madagascar’s fastest-growing coastal industries. The crop is exported mainly for carrageenan – a gelling agent used in food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals – but also serves locally as fertiliser and livestock feed. Fabricé gathers in the seaweed harvest. Depending on the season, they can harvest up to a tonne a month. With his wife, Olive, he carries the seaweed to prepare it for market. It is also eaten or used as seasoning, and serves as fertiliser or animal feed when dried. Soa Nomeny with an octopus she has speared to supplement the fish catch Environmental studies have shown that seaweed farms also help stabilise coastlines by , contributing to erosion control and carbon sequestration. he Vezo people’s adaptability, once a source of pride, has become a condition of survival. Outside the cyclone season, some families still undertake long fishing migrations, camping on sandbanks and uninhabited islets as they follow fish along the coast. “Extended migrations are always an option,” says Natana. “Whether we embark or not depends on the fish stocks nearby.” Such journeys can last weeks or months, depending on catches and resources. The lure of high-value commodities – such as shark fins or sea cucumbers bound for Chinese markets – draws some to more distant waters up to 1,000 miles (1,600km) away. “Some even venture all the way to the Seychelles,” says Strogoff, a nod to the Vezo people’s enduring nomadic spirit: always chasing the next opportunity to make a living. ritual, performed to invoke blessings, honour ancestors and seek protection, good health and plenty. People are possessed by spirits, a goat or even a zebu is sacrificed, and other offerings made, such as rice, bread or rum. The ritual is also performed at times of crisis, before a journey, or for marriages Cultural traditions remain central to community life. On Nosy Ve, families still gather for annual blessing rituals, seeking protection and prosperity. During one such ceremony, elders invoke ancestral spirits in a possession rite while villagers sacrifice a goat or make other offerings to ensure safety at sea. Life on the island reflects both endurance and fragility. Homes built from pounded seashells and palm fronds line the beach; nights are lit by torches instead of electricity. After a day at sea, the fish catches are shared equally among crews, with the surplus sold or traded for rice or solar batteries. Meals rarely change: rice, beans and grilled fish. For now, the Vezo people continue to depend on the ocean that shaped them. Yet each year, the distance they must travel grows and the risks mount. As industrial fleets expand and reefs decline, an ancient seafaring culture faces an uncertain horizon. Their struggle reflects a wider challenge across coastal Africa: how small communities can endure when the sea that sustains them is changing so fast. The daughter of Hosoanay Natana and Soa Nomeny plays with her ‘sunglasses’. When she is older, she will help the other girls and women to look for octopuses, sea urchins and sea cucumbers",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the radio soap opera is the longest-running drama in the world, and depicts life in an English country village, it will next year tour as a “live theatrical experience”, set at the Ambridge Flower & Produce show. There, fans will be able to take part in a pub quiz at the Bull, grill a BBC archivist with deep-cut trivia questions and sing along to the show’s theme tune. Comedian Angela Barnes will host the live show and each performance will feature a rotating cast of Archers actors who will be announced in early 2026. Longstanding Ambridge favourites and newer voices from the drama will make an appearance. The Archers is one of the BBC’s most popular programmes and is the top on-demand show for listeners of all ages on BBC Sounds, including among listeners under 35. Barnes said: “I am not just an Archers superfan, I am obsessed with all things Ambridge. So to be asked to host The Archers: Live at 75 is like winning a prize at the Flower and Produce show and being cast as the lead in a Lynda Snell production, all rolled into one. I can’t wait to hang out with all of my favourite characters and really immerse myself in Borsetshire life.” Alison Hindell, the drama and fiction commissioner at BBC 4, said: “The Archers is one of the BBC’s most-loved programmes and we are tremendously proud of it as it reaches the astonishing broadcasting milestone of its 75th year. We hope that The Archers live show will give fans even more of what they love, joining in the celebrations with an extra slice of Ambridge life.” James Albrecht and Serena Brett, the directors of Fane Productions, said: “Marking 75 years of The Archers is a rare privilege, and we’re thrilled to work with the BBC to create a live experience that honours the programme’s extraordinary legacy. “Taking one of the BBC’s most precious and established brands, which has lived almost entirely in listeners’ imaginations, and working so closely with Angela, the editorial team, and the cast to make it leap out of the studio and on to the stage is a wonderfully fun creative challenge. We can’t wait to share this special experience with the audiences who’ve loved The Archers for generations.” This is not the first time The Archers has left the medium of radio. In 2019, the Birmingham studios where The Archers is recorded was made to fans, who were given the opportunity to recreate iconic scenes from the long-running drama. They were also given a behind-the-scenes look at the show. Among the glamorous titbits they were made privy to were the collection of doorbells for each Archers’ property and the glass of small lego bricks used to recreate clinking ice cubes in the Bull. Fane Productions, the company behind the long-running radio drama, said The Archers: Live at 75 will run from June to November 2026 at 29 venues, starting in Manchester, then hopping around the country, stopping in Oxford, Stockton-on-Tees and Glasgow, among other towns and cities, before ending in Wolverhampton.",Sammy Gecsoyler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/myanmar-junta-prepares-elections-legitimise-power,‘Not for the people’: Myanmar junta prepares for elections designed to legitimise grip on power,2025-12-26T00:01:53.000Z,"Elections will be first since military seized power in 2021, but analysts say vote is far from a step toward democracy yanmar is preparing to go to the polls for the first time since its military seized power in a coup in 2021, but with its former leader behind bars, its most successful political party disbanded and roughly a third of the country either disputed or in rebel hands, few believe claims by its military rulers that its 28 December election will be “free and fair”. “This is not for the people, this is for themselves,” says Pai, 25, who fled Myanmar after the military seized power. “They [the ruling junta] are looking for a way out of the trap they are [in].” When polls open on Sunday, almost five years after the , the generals will be hoping the vote legitimises their grip on power – and allows them to repair their image of international pariahs. The military has rejected criticism of the vote, saying the election was not being conducted through coercion and that it has public support. “The election is being conducted for the people of Myanmar, not for the international community,” said the junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun. “Whether the international community is satisfied or not, is irrelevant.” Many western governments, and the United Nations, have dismissed the vote as a sham. However, the junta’s most important ally, , which has helped the military claw back from the brink on the battlefield, is backing the election, which is being held in three phases. Commentators say that China views the vote as the country’s best path back to stability. Analysis shows the conflict has only intensified over the past year. From 1 January to 28 November 2025, military air and drone strikes increased by about 30% compared with 2024, according to , which tracks conflicts around the world. Civic infrastructure such as schools and medical facilities have been hit in near-daily strikes. This month, on a hospital in Rakhine state, which is mostly controlled by the Arakan Army, an opponent of the military. Conscription-related abductions increased by 26% compared with 2024, with the military and forcing them to serve, in a desperate attempt to boost their dwindling ranks. Young people who have the means to do so have fled military-controlled areas such as the former capital Yangon, fearing they could be forced to serve. There is such intense paranoia among Myanmar’s ruling military that a new election protection law has been passed, under which any criticism of the election can lead to a minimum sentence of three years in prison, and even the death penalty. Since July more than 200 people have already been arrested, including for merely liking social media posts criticising the vote. In cities such as Yangon residents report the authorities going door-to-door instructing people to vote. People may have little choice but to obey, activists say. “Everybody knows well how this military is ruthless and will continue to be very ruthless. Anyone who’s seen as disapproving of the junta’s sham election are at a very high risk,” says Khin Ohmar, a pro-democracy activist who lives in exile, citing the use of repressive laws to arrest those who criticise the vote or the military’s rule. There will be 57 parties on the ballot on Sunday, but the majority are perceived as being linked to or dependent on the military. Analysts say they create only the illusion of choice, but do not represent any true opposition to military rule. Only six parties are running at a nationwide level, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development party, which has fielded the largest number of candidates and is effectively running uncontested in dozens of constituencies. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, which , was dissolved after it refused to comply with a demand to register with the junta-backed Union Election Commission. Dozens of ethnic parties were also dissolved. According to election monitoring group Anfrel, 57% of the parties that ran in the 2020 general election no longer exist, even though they received more than 70% of votes and 90% of seats. Large strips of territory will be excluded from the elections, illustrating how much ground the junta has lost since the coup – even as it has regained momentum on the battlefield. The military has said there will be no voting in 56 of 330 townships. Voting has also been cancelled in an additional 3,000 wards and village tracts, with analysts estimating about a third of the country will be excluded from the vote. Many areas are in the midst of intense fighting, or under the control of opposition groups. The country has been locked in a fierce conflict since the 2021 coup, when the military and opened fire on protesters calling for the return of democracy. Communities took up arms and formed people’s defence forces to fight against military atrocities, while older, ethnic armed groups that have long fought for independence also launched attacks, leaving the military desperately overstretched. Despite relentless airstrikes and violence that UN experts have described as likely war crimes, the . Some began to speculate the military could even be overthrown. Support from Beijing has allowed the generals to fight back. China, which feared even greater instability were the junta to collapse, cut off cross-border supplies to some of the military’s most formidable enemies in northern Shan state. Two of these powerful ethnic armed groups, the TNLA and MNDAA, handed territory back. The military, freed up to fight elsewhere, has also adapted its tactics, enforcing mandatory conscription, making better use of drones and reforming its chain of command to allow it to deploy airstrikes more quickly. In the run-up to the election, it has intensified its bombardments, seeking to cement its power in areas where it plans to hold voting. That is unlikely to ease after the vote, said Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser at the Crisis Group. The military may seek to agree to ceasefires with some groups after the election, he said, but any such deals will be tactical in nature, to give the military respite in certain areas so that it can target its force elsewhere. They are determined to continue pressing their advantage and clawing back as much of the territory that they’ve lost since the coup as possible,” said Horsey. “This isn’t about a new civilian government shifting to a more soft approach.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 7 million viewers tuned in to the BBC, ITV, Sky News or GB News to watch , which was recorded in Westminster Abbey. Charles praised the “great diversity of our communities” and used his Christmas address, to urge the nation to “cherish the values of compassion and reconciliation”. Although the king’s address was watched by roughly the same number of people as last year, it was Gavin and Stacey that won the festive TV ratings battle in 2024, with becoming the most watched Christmas Day programme in 16 years with an average of 12.3 million viewers. The Scarecrows’ Wedding, based on the picture book by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler and broadcast on One, was the second most popular programme this year, watched by 4.3 million people. – which Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman hosted together for the last time – was the third most popular programme, with 4.2 million tuning in. During the send-off, both outgoing presenters received Christmas gifts from the judges – a dance for Daly and a comedy skit for Winkleman. Their final dance ended with a tearful embrace, with Daly saying: “It’s our final time. So let’s make it count,” before the pair signed off with the catchphrase “keep dancing”. EastEnders had a drop in viewers compared with last year, with the first of two Christmas Day episodes becoming the eighth most-watched this year, with 2.85 million viewers. The second episode did not make the viewing figures top 10. , however, BBC executives will have been pleased to note that programmes from the public broadcaster made up nine of the top 10 most watched programmes across the day. A festive episode of The 1% Club, the quiz hosted by Lee Mack on ITV1, was in ninth place with 2.75 million watching. The BBC’s chief content officer, Kate Phillips, said this was “a timely reminder that shared moments really do still matter even in a world of so much choice”. All figures are based on official “overnight” TV ratings from (Broadcast Audience Research Board), which uses a panel of homes to measure what people watch across TV sets, online and via other devices. The overnight figures from Christmas Day do not include viewers who watch Christmas specials on catchup services during the rest of the festive period and do not include the small number watching the king’s message on Sky Showcase, Sky Mix HD or other non-TV platforms.

The change marks a turning point for an industry that used to reject the idea of interrupting viewing with ad breaks as a relic of broadcast TV – “We’re now reaching an inflection point in the streaming world,” said Richard Broughton, the executive director at Ampere Analysis. “This is a significant about-turn from the earlier years of streaming, in which streamers eschewed advertising for a pure ad-free subscription model.” launched its streaming service almost two decades ago, one of its biggest pitches to viewers was that they could watch whatever they wanted, when they wanted, without being interrupted by ads. As recently as 2019, Netflix’s then chief executive, Reed Hastings, said: “We want to be the safe respite where you can explore, you can get stimulated, have fun and enjoy – and have none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising.” However, three years ago the company dropped its resistance to the idea and led a streaming shift, seeking to reverse a Now the total number of UK subscribers on such plans is forecast to reach just under 26.5 million by the end of this year – up almost 7 million on last year – as new streaming subscribers opt for the cheapest viewing option, or those on more expensive ad-free packages decide that a few ads are worth the trade off for lower bills. In contrast, the number of UK streaming subscribers taking an ad-free package fell from 26.7 million to 23.1 million over the same period, according to Ampere Analysis. In the case of Netflix, for example, the cost of paying for its cheapest ad-free package is more than twice the price of its ad-supported tier. With the proliferation of streaming services, the cost for a “typical subscriber” – someone taking the standard monthly tier directly from the main players Amazon, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, Discovery+, Paramount+ and Sky’s Now TV – runs to £64 a month. This is up 14% from £56 a month in 2022. “Ongoing macroeconomic pressures mean that UK consumers are seeking more cost-effective ways of getting their entertainment services,” Broughton said. To date the impact of streamers introducing advertising has had a limited impact on traditional broadcasters such as ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Wary of the impact on their subscribers, who for more than a decade had become accustomed to streaming being an ad-free environment, the number of breaks appearing in films and TV shows has been low so far. Many advertisers were also initially put off by the high pricing that players such as Netflix and Disney+ tried to command, backed by the argument that for the first time they would be able to target audiences watching hit shows such as Rivals, Adolescence and Stranger Things. However, while Netflix has said it does not expect ads to be a “primary driver of revenue” until at least 2026, the increasing number of subscribers on ad-supported plans means the market for streaming adverts in the UK is growing rapidly. The market – which includes ITVX, Channel 4 and Channel 5’s streaming services as well as players such as Pluto TV, Tubi and the smart TV operators such as Samsung – will reach £1.38bn this year. It has more than doubled in size over the past four years, and is almost half the £3.15bn ad spend on traditional UK linear TV. Among the top 10 streaming advertisers are Apple, Tesco, McDonald’s and Subway, according to Ampere’s analysis of the UK market in November.",Mark Sweney,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2025/apr/18/how-to-beat-the-far-right-global-left-mexico-politics-morena,What can the global left learn from Mexico – where far-right politics hasn’t taken off?,2025-04-18T09:00:05.000Z,"Thomas Graham, a journalist based in Mexico City, explains how the leftwing governing party, Morena, has promoted social justice but diluted principle with pragmatism If you were to summarise the 2024 election year, you might say: grim for incumbents, good for the far right. Yet Mexico bucked both trends. Its governing party, Morena, not only retained the presidency but – along with its in the Sigamos Haciendo Historia coalition – gained a two-thirds supermajority in the chamber of deputies, the lower house, while the far right failed to even run a candidate. That a self-described leftwing party could have such success by fixing on Mexico’s chasmic inequality has drawn attention from hopeful progressives worldwide. But Morena’s programme has some not-so-progressive elements too. It is not necessarily one others could – or would want to – copy in its entirety. Morena first notched a historic result in 2018, when Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an old face of the left who ran for president twice before founding the party, won a record 55% of the vote during the general elections. Mexico’s constitution limits presidents to a single term. But this time, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of López Obrador’s, of the vote. Her victory was reminiscent of the heyday of Latin America’s “pink tide”, when leftist leaders like Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales were reelected for a second term with more votes than their initial victories. Meanwhile, the far right didn’t even get on the ballot. Eduardo Verástegui, an actor turned activist who produced , the surprise box office hit about a US federal agent busting a child-trafficking ring in Colombia, sought to bring Trumpian politics to Mexico but failed to collect the signatures required to run as an independent. Rather than developing a Mexican brand of far-right politics, Verástegui tried to transplant a distinctly American flavour that was heavy with God, guns and individualism. It didn’t take root. Morena’s success in building a leftwing movement stemmed from the party’s focus on socioeconomic justice. López Obrador developed a simple and powerful populist narrative, arguing that the country had been captured by corrupt elites, including the old political parties and their national and transnational business partners. This resonates for people in Mexico, a palpably unequal country in which roughly 27% of income López Obrador promised to change that. His charisma and his long track record in made him a convincing vehicle for the message, which he hammered home in trips to every corner of the country and daily press conferences known as the . In these, he touted his government’s achievements and lambasted its critics, shaping the media agenda. Morena’s message was amplified through state and social media, creating a kind of personality cult around López Obrador. And he delivered. López Obrador’s government doubled the minimum wage in real terms, while expanding social programmes and cash transfers for pensioners and the young, among others. It on the practice of outsourcing workers to avoid paying benefits and legislated that union contracts be put to . And it focused infrastructure projects on the historically marginalised south, building trains and a new oil refinery. From 2018 to 2022, the percentage of the population living in poverty fell from roughly 42% to 36%. By putting inequality at the centre of his discourse, López Obrador created a committed base of supporters who were willing to overlook the Although he came to power promising to improve corruption, insecurity and impunity, he achieved none of these things. His government had its own , and Mexico’s homicide rate remained high, with about 30,000 murders a year. In some ways, the situation worsened: extortion is now rampant. Despite this, large parts of the population felt increasingly confident in democracy. By 2023, 61% of Mexicans in their national government, compared with 29% when he took office. But progressives elsewhere shouldn’t be too sanguine about the prospect of copying Morena’s model. While doing all the above López Obrador also made expedient moves to the right. He cut deals with big business and swerved on tax reform. He kept fiscal austerity, meaning boosted social spending was funded with cuts elsewhere. He for political capital in Washington, and he refused to take a position on , presumably to avoid limiting Morena’s appeal. And he , a popular but opaque institution with a record of . And although López Obrador set up several commissions to investigate historical abuses by the army, Criticisms came from across the political spectrum, but López Obrador brushed them off – and often insinuated they came from actors in hock to the corrupt elites of his narrative. By the end of his government, he had lost support from some , to name a few. Yet his base continued to grow. He left power with approval ratings of about 70%. Once it became clear that Morena was on the up, politicians of all stripes, including some dubious characters, sought to join. Morena welcomed them, diluting principle with pragmatism. This shortcut to electoral success came at the cost of internal tensions. Still, Morena maintains a membership and grassroots activity that no other party can match. It has registered members, and wants to make that the party’s activists to get out to every part of the country. (It is an article of faith in the party that López Obrador’s success was born of visiting each of Mexico’s nearly 2,500 municipalities.) All of this no doubt helps ground Morena in local realities – in contrast to the fledgling far right. The party’s connection to local contexts limits how much progressives outside Mexico can draw from Morena’s example. Mexico is marked by its colonial history, and was under one-party rule for most of the 20th century before it transitioned to democracy in the 1990s. Today, organised crime exerts immense influence through violence and corruption while Mexico’s economic dependence on the US is extreme. This sharp sense of injustice is a mobilising political sentiment. It would be tempting to frame Mexico’s political landscape as a story about the left successfully resisting the right. But progressives elsewhere must ask themselves how much they would want to draw from Morena. The focus on socioeconomic justice, the narrative control and the party organisation were tied up with some uglier aspects of populism, and an expedient adoption of rightwing positions. It’s hard to say whether the latter were necessary for Morena’s electoral success. But there is dissent on the Mexican left, where some, having weighed the results against their values, are no longer on board with the party.

The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk f AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised. just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at . Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is . This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash. Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining. Economic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble. Altman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way. The bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology. At its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence. The company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier. The US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI. Since the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or sign up to international protocols restricting the uses of AI and mandating transparency in its development. Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners. In the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education. Earlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “ ”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of Not all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information. On this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing. The real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.

Look no further – a novel explained it all 20 years ago,2025-12-18T08:00:29.000Z,"The racism, the predatory politics, the banality and cruelty: we struggle to make sense of it, but JG Ballard foretold everything we are living through now n Englishman drives into a new town and can’t see the warning signs. Richard Pearson is visiting Surrey to close down his late father’s home and settle his affairs and, everywhere he looks, the flag of St George is flying “from suburban gardens and filling stations and branch post offices”. How nice, he thinks, how festive. So runs the opening not of a recent piece of journalism, but a novel by , Kingdom Come, which despite being almost 20 years old anticipates today’s Britain with eerie precision. In the mid-2000s, Pearson reads up on his new surroundings, only to find the same headlines that assail us in the mid-2020s: “Every day the local newspaper reported attacks on an asylum hotel, the torching of a Bangladeshi takeaway, injuries to a Kosovan youth thrown over the fence into an industrial estate.” The crusader crosses of St George, the hair clay and bloviating of GB News and the live-streaming, selfie-gurning, hate-spewing of – their spirit is better captured in this last fiction by the late Ballard than in many more recent and more breathless titles clogging up the annual best-of lists. At the fag-end of 2025, the UK stands possibly only three-and-a-half years away from electing rightwing extremists to power, led by a man among whose sparse credentials for office are that he has never “ ” anyone. To explain this, analysts and campaigners often reach for stories of Russian money or US networks, or for analogies with German nazism. Such accounts emphasise how unusual and exotic such movements are in Britain, how positively . The land that once boasted it couldn’t happen here can now only splutter that at least it didn’t begin here. This is bad history and worse politics. Analogies can never pass for analysis. Nor does studying the rich funders of or Robinson explain their hoi polloi followers. Fittingly for a writer who titled one of his stories Myths of the Near Future, Ballard observes the country of his time to glimpse the society of our times. Everything in Kingdom Come happens in Brooklands, a suburb that wants to pretend nothing is happening. We are not in some supposedly benighted outpost of the north-east or south Wales, with cheap sentiment about the snaggletoothed “left behind”, but a junction off the M25. Rather than Epping, the centre of last , we’re out west, among the “orbital cities of the plain, as remote as Atlantis and Samarkand to the inhabitants of Chelsea and Holland Park”. Out here are forests of business parks and convention centres, thickets of discount furniture warehouses and cheap takeaways. The great leisure activity is the gleaming giant shopping mall, which boasts “more retail space than the whole of Luton”. Amid this yawning suburbia, Pearson starts to come awake. One evening, he sees an old Volvo up in flames, and an angry mob about to storm a “shabby house”. Inside, he supposes, must be “a released murderer or a paedophile exposed by the local vigilantes”. But no. Out come Muslim women, who have been praying in a makeshift mosque and who must rely on a police line against violence from their own neighbours. As for the white locals, they have taken to wearing red crosses – not for football matches but for an entirely different kind of kickabout, where they set on Asian shopkeepers. It’s a mark of Ballard’s powers of observation that he spotted as far back as the 2000s that it would be to London’s perimeter where ethnic minorities would now be moving. The centre of the capital is not only turning whiter and richer, but the author could see how, a full decade before the Brexit vote, its enemies were defining the place as anti-English: “The West End, Bloomsbury, Notting Hill, Hampstead – they’re heritage London, held together by a dinner-party culture. Here, around the M25, is where it’s really happening. This is today’s England.” Today, politicians, economists and journalists talk of the 2000s in tones of pure elegy. Imagine! One prime minister who spent more than a decade in office. House prices always rising. Flights to third-tier European cities for 99p. Easy credit and ever-cheaper goods coming in from China. Coalmines were turning into call centres, factories were becoming malls and a productive economy was turning to consumption. In the middle of the 2000s, the former mining town of Barnsley began planning to turn itself into a , ringed by a circle of torch lights. Yet before the decade was out came an almighty crash, from which the UK has never recovered, and even before that living standards for middle- and working-class households were starting to deteriorate. In the middle of the 2000s, the going was good only for those Britons who didn’t look down to see the sands on which their lifestyles were built. Ballard was one of the very few who did look down. In his telling, Brooklands is a bubble land, and the air is already escaping. Its landscape is post-industrial Britain, built on Westminster renewal funds and property developers promising regeneration. Still, shoppers aren’t going to the mall, he notes, they’re starting to trade down. Meanwhile, the town’s top brass think the solution is to clear the mall’s hinterland of migrants, so that it can be expanded. And so they incite race riots. Near the apex of this brand-heavy, unproductive society is a guy who used to act in EastEnders and The Bill and now presents on the mall’s own cable TV channel (which gets better nightly ratings than BBC Two). But David Cruise has his eye on Westminster. As spin doctors and columnists talked about “retail politics”, an actual retailer fancies a crack at parliament. Cruise is defined in terms that could apply to many of those at the top today: “Today’s politics is tailor-made for him. Smiles leaking everywhere, mood music, the sales campaign that gets rid of the need for a product. Even the shiftiness. People like to be conned. It reminds them that everything is a game.” Twenty years after this story was printed, we are just starting to write the history of the strange death of neoliberal England. Yet Kingdom Come demonstrates that our current mess has a long, long history. The bleakness that surrounds today’s politics stretches back to when the sun was out all day long and not a cloud was to be seen. Especially if you didn’t bother looking.

But, as our new series uncovers, it doesn’t have to be this way , writers discuss the causes of – and solutions to – the housing crisis in key European cities ousing is as personal an issue as it gets. Homes are where we take refuge from the outside world, express ourselves, build relationships and families. To buy or rent a house is to project your aspirations and dreams on to bricks and mortar – can we see ourselves sitting outside in the sunshine on that patio? It can also be a deeply frustrating process – can we afford that house? For more and more of us, the answer is no. Experienced at such an individual level, it’s easy to think that rising costs are a problem particular to your community, city or country. But unaffordable house prices and rents are a continent-wide issue. According to the European Parliament, from 2015 to 2023, in absolute terms, house prices in the EU on average. From 2010 to 2022, rents rose by 18%. As an editor, I wanted to know some of the stories behind these stats and, as a person who lives in a very expensive city (hello from London!), hear some solutions. I commissioned a range of housing experts to contribute to a series, , describing what the situation looks like in some of Europe’s most expensive cities. about how changes to policy after the 2008 financial crisis encouraged wealthy foreigners to buy second homes or short-term rentals in Lisbon, pricing locals out of their city. Now some Portuguese families rent rooms, not flats. In a reversal of roles, it’s the newcomers who have it worse in Amsterdam, according to Amber Howard. Older, long-term residents live in secure and affordable social housing while younger people and recent arrivals, often on lower incomes, are left to the costly and insecure private housing sector. While social housing stock has dropped over time, private stock has increased as politicians sought to encourage wealthier residents to move into the city. It’s a similar story in Budapest, says Csaba Jelinek. Social housing was sold off after the end of the cold war, and private ownership was championed as a rejection of socialist values. What this has meant in practice is older Hungarians investing in housing and driving up prices and rents for younger generations. One city not facing an affordability crisis is Vienna. As Justin Kadi writes, since the 1920s the city has had a stable stock of social housing for tenants of all incomes. Like in Amsterdam, newcomers rent privately, but social housing has had a damping effect on rents. You don’t need to be a housing expert to see the dynamics playing out in Europe’s housing market. Over more than 40 years, housing policy has favoured those who invest in homes at the expense of those who live in them. This power imbalance is at its most stark in countries with big institutional investors – such as private equity, hedge, insurance and pension funds – as Tim White explores in his piece. When houses are not homes but assets, there is a transfer of wealth from those who have not to those who have. Across Europe – and much of the rest of the world – property has become a driving force of inequality. In turn, inequality is a driving force of resentment. Far-right politicians have tapped into this anger for their own political gain, as reported by the Guardian in a previous series of reports from the frontlines of . As the European commissioner for jobs and social rights, Nicolas Schmit, commented: “The housing problem , and it may be a risk for our democracies.” Housing policies are set at a national level, but the European Union can set frameworks and support access to finance. In 2024, all housing ministers from member states signed a declaration calling for a “ ” on affordable and social housing. There are solutions, and there is political will, and in the meantime let’s hope this series will go some way to helping those who face unaffordable housing across Europe realise they’re not alone.

They are surrounded by modern-looking housing developments – architecturally smart, medium-rise, expensive-looking in their design. This appears to be just another 21st-century development in a major city, a development that a builder has made a tidy profit out of, and flats that will have inevitably been snapped up by landlords and rented out at the highest market rate. But look a little closer, and things are different. There are more children, more families than you would find in a development like this in London. People seem to know one another, neighbours greet each other warmly and are sitting together outside, rather than dashing to the metro station with earbuds jammed in. Inside, some of the flats are arranged in clusters: eight bedrooms opening out into a communal space where neighbours cook, chat and share meals. There are a larger number of working class, poorer and ethnic-minority residents than you might expect to find in a development like this in a major city. in Zurich, Switzerland: a collection of 13 blocks of apartments that represent a different way of developing housing in major cities across the country. The buildings are all owned by a cooperative, which developed them. And the cooperative is owned by the people who live in the flats and have bought a share in the business. The result is no landlord, no speculative property developer, no soaring housing prices, no profit, no need for evictions and a structure that supports genuinely affordable housing and communal living. The cooperative includes shops, workspaces, a restaurant, a children’s nursery and a hotel. It has a no-car policy, supplemented by electric car and ebike rental systems. It could not feel more different from the UK. In many parts of the world, a cooperative such as this is not some kind of utopian dream. Actually, it’s the primary means societies from Scandinavia to South America use to provide housing for people who can’t afford outright market rates. Zurich is fast becoming a modern exemplar of how to use this model to build a different kind of city. in Zurich now lives in a cooperative – meaning they have bought a share in the company that built and owns their apartment block. This means that despite being a major global financial hub and pleasantly located on the edge of a large lake, poorer, younger people, families and students can still find somewhere they can afford in the centre of the city. The model today involves members buying a returnable share between 7,000 and 25,000 Swiss francs (about £6,500 to £23,500) to join a cooperative and get a home. They then pay a “cost rent” which reflects the cost of repaying debts and maintaining the property. Swiss cooperative housing has a long history. The movement began in the late 19th century, through workers’ movements pooling their wealth to buy houses that could offer them security amid the housing speculation which was starting to take off in urban areas. In Zurich, the city’s first housing cooperative, Waidberg, was founded in 1907, and others soon followed, including , which was founded in 1916, when 15 members started paying 20 cents each into an account. As soon as enough money had been raised, a new house would be built. ABZ still exists today, owning 5,000 homes which house 12,000 people. The movement grew after the second world war, supported by national and local governments, which offered favourable land leases and loans. The businesses became more sophisticated from the 1990s onwards, clubbing together to raise development finance. A full-scale renaissance of the movement kicked off in Zurich in 2011 after a city-wide referendum set a target that a third of the city’s housing be cooperative-owned by 2050. Since then, cooperatives have had priority access to land that is either leased to them by the city or gifted. They get low-interest loans and favourable treatment in the city’s zonal planning system. They also have access to some globally respected architects, with the developments In some instances, the city also buys up to 20% of the shares in a cooperative, which gives it rights to housing that it then offers to homeless households for lower rents. which demands the adoption of principles such as “no speculative profits, good-quality affordable and sustainable housing, integration of disadvantaged households and tenant participation and self-determination”. The legal structure of cooperatives means each member has a single vote in decision-making, which means the collective cooperative is democratically run by its residents. This can be difficult: managing a building is hard, and the democratic model is a commitment of time that UK citizens would not be used to. But it does mean that decisions about their buildings are taken by them – not imposed by a landlord or freeholder. It is also not always an easy model to make work financially: older buildings will eventually need improvement work, which causes rents to rise. And for newly built projects, rising construction costs have pushed up rents, while a scarcity of land means growth is slowing and demand is outstripping supply. This has led to accusations that they are not affordable, and in fact cater to wealthier renters and drive gentrification. Even with these flaws, the model is cheaper than it would have been if a landlord’s profit margin also needed to be factored in. Could such a model work in the UK? There is no reason to think it wouldn’t. Indeed, there is of small, thriving cooperatives here, which trace their history back decades. Part of the reason why it has never become mainstream is that we arguably did something better – council housing – so we didn’t need it to grow. But with social housing provision stalling and housing demand higher than ever, the cooperative model provides a glimpse of an alternative to our broken system. It is one we could at least explore.

Just don’t mention beef tomatoes or buffalo wings ost of what you eat is sausages. I mean, if we’re going to get literal about it. Sausage derives from the Latin , which means “seasoned with salt”. You might think of a sausage as a simple thing, but on this reading it is everything and nothing, a Borgesian meta-concept that retreats as you approach it. From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine, or the macerated parts of an electrocuted or asphyxiated pig or other animal – generally parts that you wouldn’t knowingly eat – mixed with other ingredients that, in isolation, you might consider inedible.

Never mind that cylindrical objects containing no meat have been marketed under names such as “ ) for at least 150 years.

A of 20,000 Dutch people found that 96% are not confused by such terms, which is probably a higher percentage than those who can readily distinguish left from right. The consumer must at all costs be protected from an imaginary threat. For the same reason, members of the European parliament decided, . It happens that no one is sure why a burger is called a burger. They were once called “Hamburg steaks”, but no clear link to Hamburg has been established. Nevertheless, before the term was abbreviated, meat patties were widely known as hamburgers, whose literal meaning is an inhabitant of Hamburg. If “veggie burgers” are misleadingly marketed, so is any burger not made from the minced inhabitants of a north German city. Last week, the European Council and European Commission to make sense of all this. They were unable to agree a common position with the European parliament, and bumped the decision to January, when a new council presidency will have to deal with it. I can’t blame them. You cannot make sense of a senseless policy. The parliament’s food literalism is remarkably selective. Given the time of year, perhaps I should point out that there is no meat in mincemeat, which is used to fill mince pies. Many years ago there was, but the meat component fell out of fashion. Minced meat, by contrast, meat – I’m sure that’s not confusing. Similarly, sweetbreads are meat, but sweetmeats are not. None of these terms appear to cause any problems for legislators, though they have insisted that the only of meat is “edible parts of the animals referred to in points 1.2 to 1.8 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004”, which is, let’s face it, how it’s commonly understood by shoppers across the EU. If a vegetarian hotdog is to be ruled out, as the parliamentarians demand, on the grounds that it contains no meat, the meat version should be ruled out on the grounds that it contains no dog (hothorse should in some cases be permissible). They might also be shocked to discover that there is no beef in beef tomatoes, butterfly in butterfly cakes, cottage in cottage pie, baby in jelly babies or finger (mostly) in chocolate fingers. And don’t get me started on buffalo wings. All this must be deeply confusing to shoppers. Like Wednesday Addams, who, when , asked whether they contain real girl scouts, we puzzle every day over what such names really mean. Human beings are entirely incapable of pattern recognition, derived and secondary meanings, metaphor or conceptualisation. Language never evolves, and nor does food. This is why, when confronted with “pigs in blankets”, “toad in the hole” or “spotted dick”, people curl up on the floor, banging their heads and moaning weakly (OK, there might be other reasons). Everything can have only one meaning, and this meaning must be what legislators say it is. If you are thinking “benefit of Brexit”, I’m sorry to disabuse you. If the European Council and Commission eventually decide that terms such as veggie burgers and vegan sausages are to be banned in the EU, they are as well, for fear of jeopardising trade agreements. Already, after a of a previous European decision, terms such as oat milk, soy butter and vegan cheese are , but not – because consistency is for suckers – coconut milk or peanut butter. . The decision in the European parliament is a response to , which have long been seeking to . It has no more to do with preventing confusion than a has to do with a marine bivalve. It’s about protectionism. This is why peanut butter and coconut milk are still legal: they seldom compete directly with animal products. These anti-competitive practices have a long history. In the 19th century, the US dairy industry managed first to get margarine declared a “ ”, then had its sale restricted under the 1886 Oleomargarine Act. It’s reassuring to know that legislators made just as good use of their time then as they do now. . Its campaigns are reinforced by rightwing influencers, who against a wide variety of plant products ( ), often on entirely spurious health or environmental grounds, while conveniently ignoring the far greater The food industry knows that words are a powerful weapon. If Moses had promised the Israelites a land of mammary secretions and insect vomit, I doubt many would have followed him to Canaan, though these are accurate descriptions of milk and honey. It knows that if plant-based foods have to be marketed under alien and alienating names, this will depress their market share. The livestock lobby seeks to normalise and naturalise the cruel, grotesque, planet-wrecking realities of its industry, while casting plant-based foods as unnatural and wrong. As usual, it has made minced meat of European legislators. Though I should point out that I don’t mean that literally.

I saw how one community came out on top",2025-12-20T08:00:26.000Z,"A social housing victory at the ‘luxury’ Battersea power station development shows the power of grassroots politics – and holds a lesson for all of our cities hat happens when international capital arrives on your doorstep and threatens to devour your home? The residents of the housing estates surrounding Battersea power station in London, including the Patmore where I was raised, faced that prospect when, in 2012, a consortium of bought the derelict power station, decommissioned since 1983, for £400m. Two years earlier, David Cameron had launched the Conservative manifesto in the ruined power station. He promised to increase foreign investment into the UK, and so the international investors came and bought the thing and much more. Over the years, Battersea and the adjacent Nine Elms area was refashioned as a playground for oligarchs and other international elites. The US embassy arrived, a shopping centre opened in 2022, it came with Rolex and Cartier stores, luxury private members’ clubs and apartments with multimillion-pound price tags. The whole assembly looks like a Dubai waterfront, and for a fear emerged of being forcibly displaced as occurred in . In these areas of London, regeneration had become a byword for the social cleansing of working-class communities and their replacement by affluent residents. Yet a quiet victory has occurred that shows how communities can bargain with developers. Last month, Battersea power station that it would be working in partnership with Wandsworth council to build 203 council homes as part of the development’s 17-hectare (42-acre) master plan. This win is a genuinely radical vision of what local government can achieve. And it matters because it is a radical assertion that mixed-income communities should continue to exist, and be actively facilitated, in the centre of London. Mixed communities have increasingly come under attack as ire against the housing crisis is directed at social housing tenants occupying central London locations, particularly if the household is born overseas. As Henry Hill : “Even without the immigration angle, it was only a matter of time before voters noticed that broad swathes of central London and other prime locations are currently used to house others at taxpayers’ expense.” This is a particularly personal grievance for me. I grew up in this patch of Battersea when it was seen as a relic of industrial decline, a sad and neglected avatar of inner-city roughness. Yet now that it’s been put on the map, neoliberals and cynics of state support would have it that these communities and families should uproot their foundations to make way for those with deeper pockets. It is worth considering how Wandsworth council fought back against this tide. In 2017, the then Conservative-run council approved a in the provision of “affordable” homes to be built on the site from its own 33% target at the time of the 2010 planning application to only 9%. In 2022, Labour ended the 44-year Conservative-majority control of Wandsworth. With this came the appointment of the socialist councillor Aydin Dikerdem. “As a local representative, I thought the local government should be acting almost like a trade unionist on behalf of the residents,” Dikerdem tells me. Developers went from playing on easy mode with neoliberal conservatives to having to wrangle with municipal socialism. Shunning champagne and freebies, Wandsworth Labour councillors controversially over the low levels of social housing. The council housing agreement was won after robust negotiations, aided by the Greater London authority, which included the council ending all collaborations until the housing question was addressed. Eventually a deal was brokered, because even if the primary pursuit is profit, developers still want to be seen to be building and facilitating “a vibrant and friendly community”, as is said in one of the The neighbouring Embassy Gardens in Nine Elms, with its , had already been viewed as an almost dystopian symbol of the UK’s grossest inequalities and prioritisation of global elites, and example of how not to do a local development. Community simply cannot exist without the presence of existing long-term residents. I am reminded of that whenever I pass the roadside memorial for Patmore estate legend and footballing talent Theo Porteous, who was in an unprovoked and senseless attack by a man not from the area. When he died, my entire estate poured out to pay tribute, light candles and lay flowers. There was a strong sense that the community had lost someone precious. It was an expression of familiarity and local love that is built up over years and generations, and cannot be replicated by brownfield developments. The council’s efforts go further than the power station. This year, it has built 57 new council homes for rent on the Patmore, an estate not far from the power station. There are also new outdoor play spaces, including a multi-games area named in honour of Theo. It has been beautiful seeing new families and children move to the estate and have a better start in life, as had been the case for mine 27 years ago. I hope that future residents of the power station development will be able to enjoy their new homes, playground and all the other amenities that will surely come. If you have lived in an area all your life, through its roughest periods, why should you not feel the benefits when development turns up at your door? I wish this could be rolled out across London, but the unilateral from 35% to 20% in the capital proposed by the housing secretary, Steve Reed, could scupper any future wins for local councils. The policy has been proposed as a way to get shovels in the ground and stimulate the economy. However, this is short-termist. As Dikerdem tells me, “when the market slows down (as the housing market has) and building costs go up and developers are struggling, it’s precisely the moment when the state should step in”. That could allow local government to stimulate housing demand, provide workers and cover construction costs, so long as certain social obligations are met or increased. If government could take a leaf out of Wandsworth’s book and stand up to developers, rather than rolling out the red carpet, then perhaps local communities would be all the richer for it.

But acts of courage and solidarity can point the way to a better future , the great Christian theologian and philosopher Paul Tillich asked: “Do we have a right to hope?” As an army chaplain to German forces during the first world war and a refugee from Nazi Germany, Tillich had witnessed first-hand some of the horrors of the 20th century. But his answer to the question he posed in 1965 was yes. Nobody could live without hope, Tillich told his Harvard audience, even if it led “through the narrows of a painful and courageous ‘in-spite-of’”. Sixty years on, a similar spirit of defiant optimism is needed to navigate our own era of conflict and anxiety. The fourth anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is approaching, and dark political forces menace the social fabric of western liberal democracies. More widely, a fracturing multilateral order is delivering a more unstable and threatening world. published in June by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, the number of state‑based conflicts in 2024 was higher than at any time since 1946. In Gaza, the declaration of a ceasefire in October has brought partial relief. But amid the ruins, a suffering population scandalously short of food and cruelly exposed to the ravages of winter. In Sudan, a relentless and brutal civil war continues to be stoked by outside powers in pursuit of their own interests. The shocking terror attacks at Islamist plot to launch another attack on British soil, confirm a global rise in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of 7 October and Israel’s war in Gaza. Across Europe, fear of conflict is more acute than at any point since the cold war tensions of the 1980s. In her first major speech as the head of MI6, Blaise Metreweli a new “age of uncertainty” as Russia and other hostile states refine techniques of hybrid warfare. An end-of-year by the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, in which he suggested that Russia could attack the west within five years, reflected the increasingly febrile mood of the times. Yet it remains possible to find reasons in the present to believe in better human futures. The selflessness and remarkable courage shown by Boris and Sofia Gurman, a Jewish couple, and Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Muslim, in confronting the Bondi beach gunmen, was inspiring. So too the resolve and endurance of Ukrainians who have lived of local volunteers has kept community kitchens going across the country, offering a lifeline amid a desperate hunger crisis. As Tillich in a radio broadcast during the second world war: “Love breaks out of the prison of individualism and nationalist stupidity. Love goes to another person, even one with a different language or of a different race, and returns from him richer.” A sense of the power of collective human endeavour will be felt in quite another way on Wednesday as millions tune in to the Christmas Eve at King’s College, Cambridge.

Among them, my own custom of devoting the last column before Christmas to reasons to be hopeful. In recent years, amid war and bloodshed, that task has been especially challenging – and this week was no exception. It began with the news from Bondi beach, where 15 people were gunned down and dozens more injured, most of them Jews celebrating the festival of Hanukah. That came just two-and-a-half months after in Manchester, on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur. To be a Jew at the end of 2025 is to fear that to gather together, whether at moments of joy or sorrow, is to take a mortal risk. That even to do relatively ordinary things together has become a matter of life and death. But Hanukah is not over, and its defining theme is finding light in the darkness. And so, in that spirit, I’ll keep up my own little tradition – and, as it happens, the massacre in Sydney is the ideal place to start. For there, in the pitch black of a murder spree fuelled by hate, were multiple points of light. The global imagination has been captured, rightly, by the heroism of Ahmed al-Ahmed, the passerby who, with no weapon of his own, , even wresting his gun from him. In an instant, al-Ahmed disproved the very case the gunmen were doubtless trying to make: that Muslims are somehow commanded to see Jews as their enemy, a foe to be destroyed. In an act of mind-boggling courage, he showed that the human urge to save the life of a fellow human being is more powerful. Al-Ahmed was not the only one to feel that urge. Footage of a retired couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, both in their 60s, making a similar move, tussling with one of the gunmen and grabbing his rifle. For a moment Boris seemed to succeed, wrestling the man to the ground. But the attacker apparently had another gun, and he used that to shoot Boris and Sofia dead. found – hiding under a bench as the bullets flew – to heed the plea of a mother desperate to save her children. Chaya came out from her spot under the bench and lay her own body on top of the little ones, shielding them from the gunfire until, a few moments later, she herself was shot in the leg. In each case, and during a moment of absolute terror, these people demonstrated immediate, instinctive and unfathomable courage. If there is a reason for hope this year, this might just be it: that courage is to be found, even in the bleakest places. So it’s easy, when following the , to forget that the people of Ukraine have been enduring persistent Russian bombardment for nearly four straight years. Just to keep living, as deadly drones circle overhead, requires a bravery those of us who live in a country that last came under attack 80 years ago can scarcely imagine. Or think of the people of El Fasher, the Sudanese city where huge piles of bodies are , from where more than 150,000 residents are missing, feared dead – with as many as 60,000 believed to have been killed in three weeks. Humanitarian observers say El Fasher now looks “like a slaughterhouse”, even as the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces are hard at work destroying the evidence of the massacre they committed. Think of the strength it must take to keep going, day after day, in Sudan, where this latest round of bloodletting has gone on since April 2023 but which has known brutal conflict for decades. The same is true of the Palestinians of Gaza, many of whom have spent the past two months returning to homes utterly destroyed by an Israeli bombardment that went on for two years, after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel of October 2023. Just to endure, to put one foot in front of the other amid so much grief, with as many as 70,000 killed and whole neighbourhoods obliterated, is an act of bravery. Imagine, then, the courage of those who have not only withstood the Israeli onslaught, but have dared to protest against their Hamas masters. According to , hundreds if not thousands of Palestinians demonstrated against Hamas rule, only to face “interrogations and beatings by Hamas-run security forces”. After the Hamas-Israel ceasefire and partial Israeli withdrawal in October, the punishment became more severe: footage emerged of Hamas in a Gaza City square. And yet, there are still Palestinians in Gaza who dare stand up and say no. I think of someone I have got to know these last two years. On 7 October 2023, Sharone Lifschitz learned that her parents had been seized from their kibbutz, Nir Oz. Her mother, Yocheved, then 85, was held hostage until she was released 16 days later, famously parting from her Hamas captors with : peace. In February of this year, Sharone received confirmation that her father, Oded, had been killed. Throughout, Sharone campaigned for the return of the Israeli hostages – but she also campaigned, tirelessly, for an end to the war. You would find her outside Downing Street, standing among those Israelis holding photographs of Palestinian children killed by Israeli airstrikes. Her family has been stricken by terror conducted in the name of the Palestinians; but she has never stopped demanding justice and statehood for the Palestinians, even when that puts her at odds with many of her fellow Israelis. She is brave. And I think of those not confronted by war, but who nevertheless find the strength to face down the mighty. It could be the Indiana Republicans by refusing to go along with that would have handed him a partisan advantage. Or the Scottish couple, Ros and Mark Dowey, now taking on one of the world’s most powerful corporations, for the alleged wrongful death of their 16-year-old son, Murray, who took his own life after falling prey to a “sextortion” gang on Instagram. The Doweys know what they’re up against. But they are determined that a seemingly all-powerful body finally be held to account. This week and last, I saw what that kind of courage looks like. I sat in on several sessions of the public inquiry into undercover policing, watching as one of the women deceived into a long-term relationship with a man who turned out to be a cop told her story – and as that former police officer through his own testimony, repeatedly confronted with the hard, documented evidence of his deception. Full disclosure: the woman, known as “ ”, is an old friend of mine. Even so, I was awed all over again by the courage she and the other women have shown for decades in refusing to be cowed by the Metropolitan police, insisting instead on hunting down the truth and demanding that a police force that countenanced this sex by deception – which the women involved regard as rape by the state – explain itself. For much of the past three years, I have been immersed in the story of a handful of anti-Nazi Germans who dared resist the tyranny of the Third Reich, several of them paying for their defiance with their lives. I’ve told their story in a book, The Traitors Circle. Many readers, daunted by the jaw-dropping bravery of those long-ago men and women, have assumed such courage exists only in the past. But that’s wrong. It lives on now, all around us. It’s there if we look for it – lighting up the dark.

Which will succeed?,2025-12-22T13:00:28.000Z,"While the country’s capital is loosening regulations, the Catalan city is strengthening social housing. Their outcomes will affect all our futures n Spain, two cities face the same crisis, but are responding in fundamentally different ways. Over the past decade, the cost of housing in Madrid and Barcelona has soared – with rents rising by about – leaving young people, working families and retired people in their homes or even find one. Yet, while one city is betting everything on construction and giving free rein to big investors, the other is cautiously trying to steer the housing market towards the public good, despite political and institutional constraints. This is more than a national contrast. It’s a story of two cities and two competing visions now taking root across on paper, the reality on the ground tells a different story – one of worsening inequality and housing exclusion. In the past decade, more than half of all homes have been bought , a sign that many are being acquired not by those in need of housing but by those who already own property. The number of people who own at least 10 homes has jumped by 20%. This is what I call the . Since the mortgage crisis of 2008, more than have entered Spain’s rental market. They weren’t newly built, but homes lost by working-class families and scooped up by investors, including large private equity firms. The conservative government in power between 2011 and 2018 not only handed out tax breaks and public money through a massive bailout of the banks, but also rewrote tenancy laws to turn tenants themselves into profitable assets for those institutions. The ideal of a middle-class society of homeowners is collapsing. Those already asset rich are buying up more homes and outcompeting working families. And those families, if lucky, now rent those same homes back at inflated prices, enriching the wealthy. For many, the only hope is to inherit, assuming their parents don’t have to sell their home to live out their later years with dignity. The current crisis didn’t appear overnight. It’s the product of decades of government intervention designed to turn housing into a financial asset. Since the 1980s, Spain has followed a familiar playbook: (now barely 2-3% of all homes), removing This model triggered successive construction booms that were accompanied by steep price increases. As long as everyone seemed to benefit from ever-rising asset values, few questioned the model. But it eventually proved unsustainable, pushing younger and poorer households out of the market. The 2008 crisis became a stark reminder that the neoliberal recipe had ultimately failed. Since the great meltdown, those left behind have fought back in successive waves. After years of tenant mobilisation, the Spanish government – led by a progressive coalition – finally passed a in 2023. For the first time, it gave regional and local authorities the power to cap rents, raise taxes on vacant homes and ban agencies from charging tenants fees. Additional measures in 2024 and 2025 have marked a shift away from neoliberal orthodoxy, such as extending the social housing system, ordering the removal of real-estate companies that charge unlawful fees. Despite the new law, loopholes and tax rules that encourage speculative investment are still in place, undermining efforts to reshape the housing market in the public interest. And, while the central government partly sets the framework, it is in the regions and cities where the real battle is fought – and their responses could not be more different. Madrid, long governed by the conservative People’s party, has openly boycotted the new law. Its leaders present the whole urban region as a haven where developers and funds face “no limits, no intervention”. The regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has personally at events organised by the Blackrock investment company, assuring them, “You are in the best place, at the best moment, to invest.” These words are not empty rhetoric. Madrid has to private equity funds, opposed rental regulation and is promoting . Under the mantra of “build, build, build”, it hopes supply alone will solve the crisis, easing land-use rules and fast tracking permits, claiming that red tape is to blame. Yet this approach has a track record of failure in Spain and beyond. Recent studies show that do not explain house prices, and that simply Some 400 miles to the northeast, in Catalonia, the approach couldn’t be more different. The Catalan government quickly adopted the new rules and the first results suggest they are having an effect: average rents for new contracts in Barcelona , whereas in Madrid they have continued to rise. : mid-term contracts (up to 11 months) and room rentals were left unregulated. As this gap, converting standard leases into temporary ones, quadrupling rents and charging exorbitant fees. After months of political uncertainty and repeated announcements, the Catalan government has recently approved new regulations to bring both temporary rentals and room rentals under price controls. At the same time, the Catalan government has recently approved new measures to curb speculation and strengthen social housing. These include a in 140 municipalities – a move Barcelona has also , to be implemented by 2028; that deter large-scale speculation and help first-time buyers, provided the homes they purchase in the future; and the public acquisition of private homes through the are also being designated as permanently protected housing, ensuring long-term affordability for both public and private housing. Barcelona and Madrid represent not just different policies, but different futures. One builds under public-interest rules, requiring part of new developments to remain permanently affordable, and combines this with rent controls and tax measures that aim to curb speculation. The other builds under the banner of “abundance” and increasing supply, loosening land regulations, speeding up permits and cutting taxes for developers. It’s too early to say which model will prevail, but experience and research show that simply building more and leaving housing to the market does not bring prices down. Barcelona’s story shows that regulation matters, but it is not enough. Without strong enforcement, and without tackling the incentives that reward the use of housing as a financial asset, even the most well intentioned reforms fall short. These two cities offer a choice between two paths: one where housing remains a source of unlimited profit, and another that tries – though so far inconsistently – to rebuild it as a social good. Because, at its core, this is not just about housing. It is about whether we stop the spiral of inequality that enriches the few while eroding the living standards of a growing majority, and the future of the cities we live in.

He must take up the baton for the arts,2025-12-18T06:00:28.000Z,"Not all of the problems of Britain’s cultural sector come down to funding, but an awful lot do. That’s where leadership comes in s you listen to a Christmas performance of Handel’s Messiah, it is easy to persuade yourself that all is still well with music and the arts in Britain. I again felt the familiar potency of both Messiah and of music more widely in London’s St Martin’s-in-the-Fields on Tuesday this week. When the musicians and singers launched into the fabulously affirmative final chorus, Worthy is the Lamb, towards which Handel and his librettist Charles Jennens have all along been building, the annual ritual poured forth Messiah’s deep sense of shared security and allayed doubt afresh. I’ve been going to Messiah at Christmas for decades now, at one venue or another, and the experience never ceases to lift the spirits in this darkest of seasons. This year, though, more disturbing feelings were also in play. The tender balm of Messiah’s opening lines for the tenor – “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people” – has rarely sounded more necessary and consolatory than it did this week. The austere solemnity of the oratorio’s collective reprimand against “the iniquity of us all” felt very contemporary too, especially at the end of such a dismal, demented and dangerous year. Yet music and the arts are not secure in Britain today. Instead, they are becoming increasingly insecure, as well as more marginal and marginalised. There are lots of different reasons for this process. But there should be absolutely no mistaking that it is happening. It would be dishonest not to admit that the media’s own steady marginalisation of the arts and culture, notably but not only at , is one of the important causes. Britain’s long and stupid psychodrama over so-called cultural elitism certainly doesn’t help. As Someone Else’s Music, the title of Alexandra Wilson’s brilliant new book on Britain’s tragicomic modern agonising about opera, implies, ours is often a society of culturally closed minds. How can an opera ticket costing £100 (and plenty of opera tickets cost less than that) be denounced as elitist when most World Cup tickets are costing thousands of dollars? This country has a pathetic capacity for concentrating on silly partisan squabbles while resolutely ignoring the bigger picture. Educational inequality is fundamental to this. Kids at state schools simply have far less access to the arts than kids in private schools. You can see the results in our often socially top-heavy conservatoires and arts colleges. With a few brilliant exceptions, like Trinity Laban Conservatoire in south-east London (where I was on the board for some years), it’s the expensively educated who get most of the chances, not those from less privileged backgrounds. Labour says it wants arts subjects to be , but until that actually happens and works its way through the system, we will continue to reproduce the widening unfairnesses of today. Not all of the problems of the cultural sectors come down to money. But an awful lot of them do. Whether at the individual, the corporate or the state level, we are simply too mean. Too many rich people do not put anything back (all credit to the few who do, but shame on the rest). Too many companies have minimal sponsorship or charitable budgets (hats off to the exceptions here too). And governments, whether local, devolved or national, are under spending pressures that make it easy to treat culture as an optional extra, which they do. report on the iniquitous work of Arts Council England (ACE) this week, Margaret Hodge reminds us that Britain spends significantly less per head on culture (widely defined) than almost every country in Europe. Greater Berlin alone than the entire combined arts and culture budgets of ACE and the London mayor. German public funding is under a lot of pressure itself right now, but this is a societal choice, and Britain is making the wrong one. There is something depressing about the fact that, in , Britain now has its first prime minister with a musical training since Edward Heath more than half a century ago. I am always pleased when Starmer mentions the importance of music or talks to the media about the music he likes. But the time for talk really is over. It’s time for deeds, commitment and results. Time for leadership. The Hodge report offers a blueprint for overdue change. At its heart is the vital recognition that excellence and access should not be pitted against one another as alternatives. If its findings are to be listened to, it ought to mean the application of the lessons of sports funding to arts funding, in which the best and the rest both matter. For Team GB and your local running track, read English National and your local playhouse. It also ought to mean a clearout of ACE leadership and a restructuring. But will Starmer’s government embrace it, own it and drive it? The suspicion is that the government, struggling in the polls, will neither care enough nor dare enough. Yet government has a unique responsibility that civil society, however strongly motivated, cannot equal. When the audience stands for the Hallelujah chorus at the end of part two of Messiah, we are not just taking part in a quirky British tradition (audiences in other countries tend to stay seated). We are also making a collective avowal. We are recognising the worth of what we have all inherited, should all cherish, and, echoing the lines that bring Alan Bennett’s The History Boys to its close, should all pass on. That is the government’s duty too. Yes, we must all do our bit, but it is government’s turn now.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2025/apr/25/brazil-right-precarious-workers-pay-conditions,A lesson from Brazil – where gig workers have rallied against the right,2025-04-25T07:00:27.000Z,"Rodrigo Nunes, a senior lecturer in political theory, explains how despite harsh economic conditions creating fertile ground for ‘entrepreneur culture’, resistance has sprung up among delivery drivers On 1 April, Brazilian couriers organised a day of action in which thousands of workers engaged in pickets and protests in at least , with places such as São Paulo reporting a sharp drop in deliveries. While companies are yet to respond to the demands for better pay and conditions, the mobilisation was a clear step-up for a process of national organisation that began in 2020. Between 2016 and 2021, the number of people working for delivery apps in Brazil , with the number of delivery and passenger drivers in the sector now around 1.4 million. This boom coincides with the period in which the country finally felt the effects of the post-2008 recession. Economic decline, corruption and the , ended 13 years of successful left-leaning governments by the Workers’ party (PT). In the years that followed, a series of austerity measures and labour reforms were put in place, the political spectrum moved steadily to the right and the far-right libertarian politician Jair Bolsonaro was elected president in 2018. This sequence of events, and the new reality introduced by platform work, added to Brazil’s long-established tradition of informal, precarious labour – a legacy of slavery that, as sociologist Francisco de Oliveira , is not so much an archaic leftover as an enabling condition for a highly unequal form of capitalist modernisation. Since the 1980s, thinkers in Brazil and abroad have spoken of the growing casualisation produced by neoliberalism as part of the ongoing “ The loss of protections and rights did not, however, translate into more support for unions and leftwing parties. On the contrary, it was among the newly emerged mass of platform workers that Bolsonaro found some of his staunchest supporters. In part, this was because many blamed the crisis that led them to this kind of work on the PT. But this phenomenon, which can also be observed in Argentina with Javier Milei and It is a long-term effect of how several decades of neoliberal domination over policy and discourse have impacted the ways in which people relate to themselves and one another. This can be described as an internalised “ ”, in which seeing oneself as an entrepreneur – rather than a worker, or someone who is exploited or poor – is instrumental to navigating a world in which the individual bears all risks, and for sustaining self-esteem in the face of hardship and overwork. Government regulation, from taxes to obligations put on bosses to even traffic laws, appears from this perspective as a hindrance to economic activity. Losing a car, motorbike or phone becomes an existential threat, justifying heavy policing or even carrying a weapon. All this makes the far right’s authoritarian, pro-entrepreneur, anti-organised labour message potentially appealing even to those working in the worst possible settings. Nowhere was this clearer than in the way , the extra-careful approach taken by Argentina’s Alberto Fernández made precarious workers more open to Milei’s hardline laissez-fairism. Although Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to return for a third term in 2022, this tide is still far from its ebb. Even worse, stubborn inflation and a lacklustre performance mean Lula has been losing ground among the country’s poorest for the first time in two decades among those earning less than two minimum wages. Maybe the attitudes of gig workers are not as generalised as they are often thought to be. A 2024 survey shows that , with the number going up to 75.6% among those earning the minimum wage or less. But it is not far-fetched to see the cyclists and (motorbike couriers) who snake their way through congested traffic as the bellwether of a broader social shift towards a more individualistic, cynical outlook. Nurtured by online coaches and the of evangelical churches, it is one that is distrustful of collective solutions, and which accepts the struggle for survival as a natural fact to be gamed, not questioned. All of this means that, even when they organise, couriers’ politics can be ambiguous. It demands better conditions, but rejects the loss of autonomy associated with regular jobs; it slips between seeing couriers as a class and as a collection of individuals. High turnover and little collective identity mean few people stay long enough in the frontline for organisation and experience to flourish. And yet, precisely because they are so numerous and paradigmatic of the way the economy is moving – not just in , but in any country in which casualisation and platform work is thriving – finding ways to reach them is a key challenge for the left. in 2020 suggested a more readily recognisable form of class politics – with the brief emergence of the group – reality has since remained obstinately hard to read. But there are interesting experiments afoot in organising workers more fairly, and away from the call of the far right. that sprung up in the wake of the 2020 mobilisations did not last, some attempts at creating worker-owned, worker-managed delivery services, some of them with their own apps and control over data, have thrived. Among these are , a 2,700-member-strong federation of ride-hailing cooperatives in three states, and , a bike courier service by cis women and trans people that has existed in São Paulo since 2017. Outside the circulation sector, is a chatbot created by the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST) to connect people looking for services from building to education to activists who provide them. In last year’s municipal elections, the scramble for a place in the final round of São Paulo’s mayoral contest between MTST’s Guilherme Boulos, who promised rest stops for couriers where they could access basic services, and internet coach Pablo Marçal, who sells the entrepreneurial dream that lures gig workers and beyond, provided a good picture of the fight over the urban precariat. Boulos beat Marçal, but lost the head-to-head vote against the Bolsonaro-supported incumbent. The hope story, however, came from the success of , which began as an online campaign against the six-day week common in the service sector, and has since collected almost in support of a bill to limit the working week to 36 hours, , who founded the movement while working in retail, with a TikTok video that made him into a viral sensation, was the left’s most-voted-for city counsellor in Rio de Janeiro. While having all the potential pitfalls of internet-based initiatives, the campaign felt like the first time in ages in which the politics of work was back on the agenda, and it was neither neoliberal reformers nor the far right – which struggled to find a position that did not come across as anti-worker – on the front foot. What is more, it thrived on social media, a terrain that since Bolsonaro has mostly served the right. This not only proves that there is much to be gained if the left is willing to go on the offensive, but will no doubt leave important lessons as to how that can be done.

The basic answer probably touches on a few aspects of the 21st-century experience. One is the horror and conflict that seem to define the news almost every day. Another centres around the material pressures that increasingly grip supposedly peaceful countries: the never-ending cost of living crisis, and the impossibility for millions of people of a secure job, a dependable home and some halfway viable idea of the future. Something else demands a mention: the all-pervading mixture of absurdity, nastiness and anger fostered by the internet. Bigotry runs rampant. What we still rather laughably call social media now seem to operate on the basis that the ideal story mixes wildly improbable elements with the kicking-up of moral outrage (witness that ghoulish “online content creator” Bonnie Blue, who, to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, ended the year by for Nigel Farage). You can check your feed in a mood of mild curiosity, but find yourself instantly pulled into what this results in: great storms of mockery, loathing and polarised shouting. The biggest prizes seem to go to the high-profile figures who cynically manage to turn all this to their advantage – which is the essential story of everyone from latter-day porn stars, through extremist “influencers”, to the current president of the US. And the resulting noise seems only to increase people’s feelings of anomie and disorientation, particularly among the generation that was born into a world remade by the internet, and then came of age amid the aftershocks of the crash of 2008. I get emails three or four times a week that paint this picture, crisply summed up in a press release from September, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy: “Young people are surviving, not thriving, with many feeling disconnected and pessimistic about their future.” Journalism can perhaps only scratch the surface. Really evoking and exploring the whole surreal mess is the job of novels, plays, films, TV dramas and records. And when it comes to music, this year has delivered an absolute peach: Euro-Country, by the Irish singer-songwriter Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, better known as CMAT. its 29-year-old creator, “Every song touches on an emotional detail of what it’s like to have come up in this era of capitalism and what it’s done to us all.” It is an album replete with visions of people becoming more and more lonely and alienated, but that also makes a stand for a basic humanity: it , basically, and combines its portraits of an increasingly bleak world with an implied insistence that we could all play our part in something better. Now, you do not necessarily need to know any of this to appreciate CMAT’s brilliance. Plenty of her best songs are about matters of the heart. If you are one of the tens of thousands of people who watched her and her band play over the summer (not least , where she achieved what music-biz cliche would call a career-defining performance), you will know that she is a flamboyant, funny and self-confident onstage presence, and the pleasure of watching her play live is more about dizzying entertainment than social commentary. But the basic point still stands: the best musicians are always lightning rods for their time, and she is easily 2025’s best example. Some of the album’s most incisive lyrics are focused on her home country. Fittingly, the cover of Euro-Country portrays Thompson emerging from a fountain at a retail destination near her home town of Dunboyne, in County Meath: where she comes from, she has said, is increasingly a place characterised by “shopping centres and cement and roads”, where “There’s been years and years of basically no social services … and everyone’s just been by themselves on Facebook, scrolling and getting radicalised by the far right.” These things, of course, are evident in lots of other countries. But if you really want to understand how raw economics can be an offence to the human spirit, on the housing crisis that was then gripping Dublin, and still does. Amid the European HQs of Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and what was then known as Twitter, I experienced a place where, to quote one stock line I heard all over the city, “Homeless families stay in hotels, and tourists stay in houses.” Everyone I met also talked about the “ghost estates” that peppered the country beyond its capital, built in the midst of the so-called Celtic Tiger boom, that were still vacant and had left no end of human wreckage. is all about. “It was normal,” Thompson sings, “building houses / That stay empty even now.” She also makes reference to what happened to some people who bought into the dream and were left wrecked: “I was 12 when the das [ie dads] started killing themselves all around me.” That is quite a line to write and sing. There are other songs that fuse the personal and political. Iceberg is about how insecurity – both financial and personal – breaks people, and about a friend who “used to wanna pick fights and scream about any ol’ thing”, but is now “drowning”. There is a bracing, unsettling examination of the modern male gaze and its sinister consequences titled . But Euro-Country’s key moment of triumph is , which perfectly captures the queasy, accelerated whirl of the 21st century, and how much it can warp how we relate to each other. As the writer and critic Dorian Lynskey , it’s about something quintessentially modern: “the tragicomedy of misdirected anger”. It portrays Thompson pulling in on the motorway for a sandwich, finding an outlet branded with Oliver’s name, and collapsing into a rage that even she doesn’t understand. “I’m wasting my time on seething,” she sings. Her phone is an implied presence: the most barbed lines (“I needed deli but God, I hate him”) might easily have been posted online. And though the lyric is often hilarious, it hints at something incontestably true: the fact that as we rant about other human beings, what really puts us in that mood – which takes us back to housing, jobs and all the rest – grinds on. play almost two-and-a-half years ago. She was performing in a big top at a festival in Shropshire, to an audience of a few hundred. As the show went on, more and more people began to realise the level of talent right in front of us, and responded accordingly. But I now appreciate something else: Thompson does what the best singers and songwriters do, perfectly crystallising their time while inspirationally making a stand against it. In a lot of great art, after all, there is always a sense of defiance. Hers is full of it, which is why it is such a brilliant carrier of something that this year sometimes threatened to snuff out: a very human kind of hope. John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2025/apr/04/bnp-east-london-local-politics-margaret-hodge,"What smashed the far right in east London? A playbook that said connect, connect, connect",2025-04-04T07:00:47.000Z,"Labour peer Margaret Hodge shares how the party tackled the rise of the British National party in Barking before the 2010 general election Once again, the far right is advancing across Europe, emboldened by the outcome of the 2024 presidential election and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. To turn back extremism masquerading as populism, I believe there are lessons we can learn from our battle against the extreme right in Barking in 2010, when The context is different. There was little social media before 2010; we hadn’t been through a pandemic; there was no major war in Europe and no serious challenge to a rules-based international order. But there were factors at play then that are relevant today. Turnout at elections was on the decline. In Barking, east London, the 2001 general election voter turnout was 45.5%, down from 61.7% in 1997. Our research revealed that it was anger, not apathy, that kept people at home. Anger that the politicians were not listening to what mattered to voters; anger at the at Ford in Dagenham; anger that successive governments had not built decent, affordable housing for local families; anger at the way immigration was transforming the local community yet politicians refused to even engage in a debate on the issue. By 2006 this anger found a home as voters began to turn to the BNP. The BNP stood 13 candidates at the 2006 council elections . Had they stood more candidates, we would have had the first BNP-controlled council in Britain. In 2006, the Barking Labour party had lost voters’ confidence. We spent too much time looking inwards, talking to ourselves, and too little time connecting with our voters, listening and reflecting their priorities. And we did far too little to challenge some of the blatant lies that the BNP peddled and that spoke to people’s frustrations, lies of the type now amplified by social media. For instance, the myth that the Labour government was became accepted orthodoxy, just as lies about Ukraine starting the war with Russia are becoming today. Our task was to rebuild trust with our voters, and it took four years of hard and focused work to get there. Had we left it to the short campaign, we would have failed and Barking would have elected a BNP MP. nationally was losing support and we were heading towards the end of the Labour government. So campaigning on national issues in Barking was not our answer. But we understood that all politics starts from the local. People care passionately about what is happening in their immediate environment. They are not interested in the Westminster obsessions; they care about car parking, litter, the siting of a bus stop. National issues are only important to voters if they have a local impact. Between 2006 and 2010, immigration and the lack of affordable housing were the two key national issues my constituents cared about. We focused completely on what mattered to our voters, and I transformed the way I worked. Everything had to help me reconnect with my voters. I stopped attending endless party meetings and town hall events. I focused on connecting with as many voters as I could. I wrote directly and often to voters, asking them to coffee mornings and street meetings. I sought their support on local campaigns, such as getting a bus route diverted to a hospital. Communicating directly with people was central to our strategy. Those that came to our coffee afternoons got a decent cup of coffee and chocolate biscuits, and we listened to their concerns; we did not preach our agenda. Listening was fundamental, and at every coffee afternoon some local issue invariably emerged. We then tried to sort out the problem. We acted on what we heard, then we communicated our action back to all the voters we had invited, even if they did not all attend. We created a virtuous circle through communicating, listening, acting and communicating that helped us rebuild trust. We also engaged openly in the difficult issues, including immigration. Not by labelling those with concerns as racist, not by promising to turn back the clock and cut immigration, but by working to understand what was causing the hostility and trying to respond to legitimate concerns. So, for instance, we argued that with so little social housing available, it was right that a family’s connection with a local community should receive some weighting in the rationing of social housing, as well as the family’s housing need. That was contentious with the left, but we wanted to burst the toxic bubble by responding to what people believed created unfairness. And we always made the positive case for immigration and the diversity it brought, for instance by taking inclusive photos on St George’s Day. The vindication for our approach came with the triumph of smashing the BNP, and creating the circumstances that led to the disintegration of that party. Today, social media has undoubtedly played a significant role in the rise of the populist right, enabling those with extreme political beliefs to find communities of like-minded people who will amplify the hatred and launder it through disinformation and lies. But the current obsession with social media as a channel for political communication should not blind us to the dictum of the great US Democratic politician Tip O’Neill . I hope current politicians and communities, facing the challenge online and on the streets, can draw from our experiences in 2010. It is possible, indeed it is necessary, to channel voters’ concerns into mainstream political discourse; to stop communities being infected with hatred and lies.

Often they are more trouble than they are worth igel Farage is storing up trouble by welcoming . I should know. When I was chief whip, nothing united a party quite as much as a defection. Old enemies call a truce from their daily hostilities to turn all the available ire on the traitor in their midst. Ask Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP for Witney while making all sorts of rather grand demands in the process. He was blackballed by his original party for such a flagrant act of opportunism, and hated by his new family as someone never to be entirely trusted. I remember the shock and anger when entering the chamber in April 2024 for PMQs. Not only had we had no warning, but as he had barely even attended parliament in anyone’s recent memory, we weren’t quite sure whether Labour would know who he was. Only weeks later, Dover diehard Natalie Elphicke and also promptly disappeared from view. How she could have left friends and whips a few hours earlier with the impression that she was voting with the government that day, I am not quite sure It seems that such niceties matter little to the “defector community”, any more than loyalty to the party, volunteers, voters and supporters who gave them such a privileged position in the first place. Why should Reform expect any better? It was those two “left-field” defections that caused us the jitters over in No 10. Were there more? We had heard rumours, but there were always rumours. To be safe, we ran a check on every single colleague, ranking them green, amber or red and sending in the charm police for anyone in the most dangerous category. Losing two colleagues was annoying; lose three and it might start looking careless. Although the date of the election was at that stage still undecided, we all knew that if anyone else went, any plan would go with them. Looking at the names of those who have made the journey to Reform is also revealing. , he was at pains to assure me that he was going nowhere, and we therefore planned a session within days to map out an elegant return. But something happened over that weekend, and he was gone. : all have trodden the same path, all humming to the same old tune that “the Conservatives no longer represent my values blah blah”. This is despite most of them signing up to, and even voting for, the very immigration policies put forward by their hero, Boris Johnson, that they now suddenly find so indigestible. Then, joined the list as the first sitting Tory MP to defect, completing the least surprising collection of the disgruntled it would be possible to find. And recently it’s been the turn of the little-known from the House of Lords and former MP , who had to make a hefty charity donation Can defectors be identified before the act? That’s not easy, but there is a common link, a symptom that might be hard to pick up without a political stethoscope. First, this is a group of people who have always found it hard, impossible even, to operate as a collegiate force. They were loners, the sort of people neighbours describe as “keeping themselves to themselves” hours after discovering that they have committed some misdeed. Some of them, Kruger being one, are driven by such an unbreakable ideological vision that they cannot fully grasp that politics is a numbers game and is annoyingly reliant on consensus and compromise. Second, they often think there will be payback; they may even have been promised it. Perhaps a key seat at the next election, a place on the list for the Senedd elections next May, a mayoral nomination or even a peerage. One thing is certain: these defections are acts of opportunism and therein lies the trouble for Farage. Usually, defectors want something. If they don’t get it, they will react in much the same way as they did when we turned down their similar demands. There will be a petulant outburst, often timed somewhat vindictively to cause the greatest embarrassment for the people whose trust and support they had hitherto relied upon. The recent flurry of defecting councillors and former MPs is a case in point. Each and every one of them owes their well-funded existence to the Conservative party, and its financial and volunteer resources, not to mention voters. If they must defect, couldn’t they at least do it with a bit of class, and retreat quietly into the background after a brief but considered message? Or better still, trigger a byelection, just to make sure that voters are as enthusiastic about their new brand as they were one that actually got them elected? As ever, there are some honourable historical exceptions. Churchill was elected a Conservative but within a few years joined the Liberals on the back of his opposition to a bill to reduce the flow of Jewish migrants fleeing the Russian empire, only to return to the Conservatives about 20 years later. In the more recent political earthquake of 1981, four heavyweight Labour MPs (David Owen, Shirley Williams, William Rodgers and Roy Jenkins) formed the “gang of four” to start the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Kemi Badenoch would be wise to stick to her guns, encouraging other wobblers to step away now.

Yes, the polls look bad – but these days they reflect little more than voters’ passing whims erry Christmas, Sir Keir, and a happy new year. Or as they say in Downing Street these days, make merry for tomorrow you may die. At your drinks for lobby correspondents last week there was reportedly one topic alone. How long had you to go: months, weeks, hours? We all know bad news sells. Political reporters cannot handle prime ministers sleeping soundly at night. But the terminal gloom around Keir Starmer’s position is absurd. Not a morning passes without rivals being declared, and not an evening without the BBC’s Chris Mason dragged from his supper to stand in the cold. He just frowns and forecasts Armageddon. Starmer is variously described as the , most rebelled against, most loathed prime minister of all time. Asked for a prediction, the Westminster lobby grasps the most stinging nettle it can find. It currently rates Starmer as finished. It did the same to Margaret Thatcher after two years in 1981. in the Economist was gripping. It showed that when a party’s share falls below 30%, predicting the outcome of first-past-the-post in any constituency is near worthless. In lobby terms, you can use it to back any story you want to write. At , the surging Reform party got 14% of the total vote but won just five MPs; the Liberal Democrats got 12% and 72 MPs. had Reform winning “between 112 and 373 seats” and Labour winning “between 36 and 295 seats”. This is no use to anyone. Put another way, Starmer needs only to recover seven points to make Labour the largest party in parliament again. Meanwhile, an MRP poll leaked last month had Kemi Badenoch The fact is that when five parties all have between 15 and 30% of the poll, as is roughly the case at present, first-past-the-post makes any election a lottery. As for the leaders, when party affinities are no longer tied to ideology or class loyalty, “popularity” can swing wildly. It goes with charisma or the last appearance on television. I find it hard to “loathe” or “hate” Starmer. Not knowing him personally, I find his decisions inept – but he seems likable and harmless. He sounded most plausible on on Radio 3 in October. He admitted he became prime minister having not made the grade in music college on the flute. I keep seeing him as a failed flautist. Labour is in Downing Street by the wildest of flukes. In 2024, Starmer actually won half a million fewer votes than his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, did in 2019. It also won a smaller share of the poll, 34%, than the Tories and Reform combined at 38%. Last year the British electorate turned right, not left. In other words, Labour’s record majority had nothing to do with democracy. It was first-past-the-post at its wildest. With five parties looking like contenders next time, and a hung parliament most likely, you might as well roll a dice as to who gets to Downing Street. Starmer’s performance as prime minister has not been outstanding, but it’s hardly been disastrous. His devotion to his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has alienated employers, , publicans, landlords, planners and the countryside. He has got little thanks for his and the green energy lobby. But these are hardly hanging offences. In fact, in two important policy areas, Starmer has been in the right. He has restrained public borrowing, which should give him room for manoeuvre down the line. According to the IMF, next year the UK will be the in the G7 after the US, and that is worth a real boast. The prime minister has also started down the vital route to reversing the Brexit disaster, most recently in . That is also good news. Otherwise his foreign policy may be measured only in air miles – but overseas nowadays is mostly about show. He has deftly handled the warmongering of the defence spending lobby. This has simply not been a Liz Truss/Boris Johnson disaster binge. Starmer has made bad appointments and has a ropey Downing Street machine; but if backbenchers are restive, Starmer has enough of them to get by. He performs confidently with Badenoch in the weekly pantomime at the dispatch box. The idea that Angela Rayner or Wes Streeting or even Andy Burnham is massing armies of eager supporters at Starmer’s door is ridiculous. There is no obvious leader of the party yet identified as superior to Starmer. I cannot believe Labour really wants to fall on its sword. The next election is utterly impossible to call. The polls are useless predictors, as will be next May’s local elections. They will be a sign of passing whim, not of who the voter most wants as prime minister. Starmer may not be exciting, but that is hardly new in Downing Street. He has time – and in politics, time is power. He should take a leaf out of Thatcher’s book. Just stay there. Just survive. I predict he will.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/smartphones-photos-filters-pictures-software,"Now that phones alter our photos without us knowing, how do we know what’s real?",2025-12-23T15:00:44.000Z,"Comparing the pictures taken with my camera’s automatic software to those taken with a ‘zero-processing’ app, the results are shocking. Is this a good idea? was flicking through a photo album at my grandma’s when I came across a picture of my mum as a child. I took a photo and sent it to her, but on my phone screen, it looked brighter and more vivid than the physical version in my hand. Adding an Instagram filter is something I would now only do ironically. But is my phone increasing the contrast or making other tweaks without my knowledge? To find out, I downloaded an app with a “zero-processing” feature that claimed to take photos without any software alterations. When comparing the photos my camera takes automatically to the photos taken with this app, the results were shocking. The so-called “raw” photos that lack processing had subtle, muted colours, softer edges – a little grainy – while the processed photos were gorgeous and crisp like the inside of a marble. Why were they so different? The answer to this, like everything else these days, is machine learning, used by virtually every major smartphone-maker to enhance the photos taken with their cameras. Professional photographers have been aware of it for years, as you can readily see on Reddit, YouTube or Facebook. On Aurora-Hunters UK, enthusiasts accuse one another of “cheating” by using phone cameras that “automatically brighten the picture”. But outside these niche circles, it’s rarely discussed. We communicate, build relationships, advertise ourselves through our pictures – and yet they are being heavily manipulated without our knowledge. I told my friend about this on a walk, showed them the two photos side by side, and on the train home they said they “couldn’t stop thinking about it”. Tech companies are making decisions on our behalf about what our photos, and therefore our lives, look like. We’re used to being lied to, and for new technologies to encourage an increasingly smoothed and . It’s a common experience, needing to actively go to our phone settings to turn off smoothing effects on our faces. My sister freaked out when her phone automatically tried out a “jawline enhancer” on her front-facing camera, that she had to turn off. And while the newest phones always come with boasts about improved cameras, this is somewhat deceptive: due to “ ”, phones are physically too thin for the hardware to change dramatically, so instead, it is often computer software that is improving our photos. These decisions, made by expert teams who are designing and programming our phone software, are not taken because they have a specific “photo look” in mind that they want to impart on the rest of the world – in order to control us, leading to world domination etc – but because they are seriously, and religiously, studying . As I take photos without processing, I come to prefer them to the lurid, creepily vibrant photos created by my phone’s permanent settings. I am not alone – everyone I ask, amateur and professional photographer alike, prefers photos taken on a film camera, or even digital camera, to photos taken on our phones. But do these musings and taste preferences matter when I need to capture something quickly? No. Consumers apparently want these bright, lurid photos. They want to be able to capture quickly, and still get non-blurry images. Consumers want their faces to look nicer in the photos, because it will make them feel better about themselves – but not too nice, not too edited, because it will seem fake. Tech companies want us on our phones more, and so making our photos more appealing, in a magpie-shiny-objects-way, is going to do that. This is when it starts to feel like a trap. Even before this kind of automatic processing, the way our photos looked was somewhat pre-decided. Sensors pick up light and behave in certain ways to create certain images. Lenses with specific traits inherent in them determine how colourful the picture comes out, so photos are, to a certain extent, cooked eggs, with huge amounts of processing involved already. The “look” of photos, even in the 1970s with Fujifilm, wasn’t necessarily in the control of the photographer. But there are obvious flaws with tech companies deciding what the “majority” preference is – how do they even decide such things? Consumer research? Data collection? Letting consumer desire – or demand – become the be-all and end-all for our products isn’t ideal. The short-term satisfaction given to us by our tech products has tended to cause long-term problems. My mum has recently been going through boxes of old photos that she hadn’t looked at in decades. There are a few that my grandad took in the 1960s – including one of my mum as a toddler, holding a tennis racket that is bigger than her own body, watched over by my grandma. I showed it to my grandma, who was overwhelmed that she had produced such a little “dote”, and couldn’t believe the young woman’s body in the foreground was hers. She told me how photos such as this are rare because it was typical of my grandad to take shots of views, rather than of his family – which made us laugh. My grandad was putting his personality into his photos – even if most of them were bad, or blurry, or failed to get his own wife in, at least they revealed a crucial element of him, some enthusiasm and eccentricity. Looking through these prints can tell a story about what he was like as a person. Whoever designs the tech, designs the image. With higher levels of control from tech companies – including embedded auto-processing that we cannot turn off – we begin to get narrower limits for us to express ourselves through our photos. When I look at them side by side, it’s undeniable that the processed photos are closer to the vibrancy of what I perceive as real life. They add a light or a sharpness that feels like it reflects what I see in the world around me. But what if that’s not what I want from my photos? If my grandad had grown up with a smartphone, what a bounty of wonderful, ultra-HD, glowy, vibrant photos of birds and planes he would have been able to take – but still, I can’t help but feel that that would have been a shame.

This week, the UK announced it is rejoining the programme. This will open the door beyond the many young people who attend university – its remit includes FE students, apprentices, and youth and school groups. A whoop of excitement , with opportunities for those involved in education, training, culture and sport, and a commitment to maximise take-up by disadvantaged young people. Widening experience, encouraging adventure: Erasmus+ may help cure Britain’s monolingual handicap and the catastrophic decline in language courses. Last year in the UK, less than This all eludes Europhobes such as Andrew Neil, on X that “extra taxes now being inflicted on working people will be used to finance some ‘study’ in Barcelona for gap-year yahs from affluent families”. Our expensive experiment with isolation from Europe is unwinding. Forget Labour’s embarrassingly futile slogan of “ ”, its insistence on “red lines” and fear of doing anything that might reignite Brexit passions. Now it is accelerating from tiptoe to trot towards Europe. Last month, : “We must confront the reality that the botched Brexit deal significantly hurt our economy.” Listen to other ministers’ language. : “The cuts to capital spending and Brexit have had a bigger impact on our economy than was even projected back then.” Wes Streeting said Labour should undo “the economic damage done by Brexit”, while in one interview to rule out reversing a Brexit that had “badly damaged our economy”. This is the new mood music, as Liberal Democrats and Greens eat Labour’s pro-European lunch, with considering fleeing to them as to Reform UK. The Europhobe response to rejoining Erasmus has been as demented as you would expect. The Mail again (Turkey is an associate member of the programme), with the headline “Thousands of Turkish students could come to UK” – a reprise of The Tories and Reform hope Labour is falling into their trap on Europe, reawakening deep Brexit “betrayal” passions. But they sound out of step: the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, says: “Labour continue to betray Brexit … dragging Britain back under the control of Brussels.” YouGov 65% support for rejoining Erasmus with only 12% opposed. Even back in 2020, as the Brexit axe fell, 61% The Tories and their media attack the £570m cost of Erasmus. But if they bandy around numbers they have to answer for the whole cost of Brexit. The National Bureau of Economic Research finds that the UK’s GDP is between than it could have been. The House of Commons library estimates that leaving the EU is costing the Treasury up to in lost tax revenue. Here’s how. Unless lorries are backed up outside Dover, the unseen blockages and deterrents to trade usually go unnoticed, yet an estimated 16,400 companies Here’s an example of the obstacles, reported . Four refrigerated lorries carrying £650,000 worth of Scottish lamb to Europe were stopped at Calais; the meat was rejected by French inspectors despite being stamped as fit for consumption by the UK’s Food Standards Agency. Worse still, the lorries were not allowed to return, either. “They hold all the power. We’re completely helpless,” said West Scottish Lamb. As the meat neared its viable time limit, they said that standoff was “crippling our business”, adding: “The UK government has effectively handed the French authorities the power to control our goods.” Yes, that’s what the disastrous Brexit deal did. They can reject our exports, now we have given up any say. It was sorted last week, at the last minute. Though not accepted into the EU, the meat was finally allowed to return to the UK, after what I spoke to the National Sheep Association’s Phil Stocker, who said: “In the last six months there have been more problems. Our standards have become misaligned. They change some rules and we aren’t told.” This matters as more than a third of lamb is exported, and 95% of that . “We urgently need that trade agreement on food,” he adds. The is that it is negotiating an that will boost trade and remove border checks. Stocker says he’s optimistic it may get done within 18 months, cutting red-tape costs. This example, he says, shows how Brexit makes costs rise and GDP contributions fall. No doubt when that SPS deal is made, Brexiters will protest that we have become rule-takers, obeying Europe’s standards. But that’s what Brexit did, obliging exporters to conform while removing our seat at the table to decide on standards and rules. There will be more trouble ahead, warns Liz Webster of Save British Farming, for as long as the government tries to keep strategic ambiguity with the US. The UK has agreed to allow up to per year (if it conforms to our standards, and is not hormone-fed), to the distress of beef farmers such as her. Donald Trump is pushing Britain for a full food trade deal, chlorine-washed chicken and all, yet that would kill off any deal with Europe. Given Trump’s erratic behaviour over existing deals, and ministers’ and senior MPs’ warning that all agreements with him are only “ ”, the time is rapidly approaching when Britain will have to choose.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/housing-crisis-in-europe-vienna-renters-social-housing,Vienna has been declared a renters’ utopia – here’s why,2025-07-10T06:00:12.000Z,"Social housing makes up almost half of the city’s 1m homes. The system isn’t perfect, but it gets a lot of things right hen it comes to best-practice examples in the housing debate, Vienna is a common reference. Indeed, the Austrian capital features prominently in narratives about successful housing policies. An concluded that Vienna shows “decent homes for all” is not an impossible dream. And the New York Times even declared it “ A considerable part of the attraction of Vienna relates to its large social-housing stock. It accounts for of the roughly 1m housing units in the city. About half of it is municipally owned council housing. The other half is provided and administered by limited-profit housing associations – an Austrian version of social housing providers that are permitted to make a small profit to finance their operations. Social housing is not just for those on low incomes, but also caters to middle- and even some upper-middle-class households. The positive impacts are directly measurable. Rent levels in the social-housing sector are significantly lower than in the private rental market: newly rented units in the limited-profit and council housing sectors cost . Housing quality, meanwhile, is often higher, particularly in the limited-profit housing stock. Moreover, the availability of social housing also dampens rent levels in the private rental market, as a The sector has not grown overnight. It originated in the municipal socialism of “ ” in the 1920s, when the Social Democratic Workers’ party set up far-reaching social policies to improve the living conditions of the working class. Financed through progressive taxes, housing played a large role. Today, the Social Democrats are still in power and social housing provision continues, albeit in a different form. Council housing construction has waned since the 1980s, and limited-profit housing has increased. A considerable amount of the financing comes from a 1% levy on the salaries of every employee in Vienna. A particularly striking feature of Vienna’s social housing sector is its remarkable stability. Whereas privatisation has left large dents in the sector in cities such as London, Berlin and other large cities in Europe, in Vienna, the impact has been much more moderate. In the early 2000s, the Austrian conservative/rightwing coalition government sold federally owned housing associations to financial investors, which affected the stock in Vienna. Meanwhile, in the 1990s, a right to buy was introduced by the federal government for tenants in the limited-profit housing stock. So far, the impact of the programme in Vienna has remained moderate. Many tenants decided to continue renting instead. Along with new construction, this means that social housing has not declined in relative terms, but has retained a stable share of the housing market since the 1990s. as these points may suggest. One issue relates to the accessibility of social housing. In a system where such a large part of housing is distributed through bureaucratic means rather than through the market, allocation is a delicate matter. Applicants can sign up for a waiting list that factors in their housing need and living situation as well as income. Housing associations allocate parts of their stock through their own channel, which makes the system additionally complicated. Moreover, parts of the housing-association stock require tenant down-payments, which can be a financial barrier. Overall, the system is complex, and tends to prioritise those who know how to navigate it and those who have been living in the city for longer. Newcomers to the housing market can rent privately instead. This sector has, however, over the past three decades. Formerly, commentators have referred to it as an “integration machine”, offering low-quality yet strictly regulated and therefore relatively inexpensive housing to those unable to access social housing. In the 1980s, the deterioration of the stock was considered increasingly problematic and the government deregulated the Tenancy Act to make letting more profitable. Rent-setting was made more flexible, temporary rental contracts were introduced and landlords were allowed to charge higher rents in areas with higher land prices. While the stock has since been upgraded substantially, inexpensive housing has been lost, to the disadvantage of housing newcomers who rely on it. One simple takeaway from the Vienna case may be that policy matters. Through long-term commitment to social housing and limited privatisation, housing can be made better and more affordable. An even more fruitful takeaway, perhaps, may be that Vienna, through political choices, has managed to set up a regime of housing provision that prioritises housing as a basic need to a greater extent than other European cities. This regime not only includes policymakers from local to federal level, but also planning authorities, developers, landlords, housing associations, banks and construction companies among others. Understanding how this regime came into being, how it works and how it deals with challenges may be the most useful point to study for cities that want to learn from Vienna.

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/25/the-best-old-music-we-discovered-this-year,"Paranoia, pop-dubstep and perfectly odd gems: the best old music we discovered this year",2025-12-25T14:00:42.000Z,"Strange folk, lost pop, disco oddities and, um, Dido – here are the forgotten tracks that became this year’s most replayed revelations I grew up listening to the Mamas and the Papas’ hits but had never heard their albums before this year. I had no idea anything as creepy as Mansions lurked within their sunny oeuvre. Its sound is ominous, its mood one of stoned paranoia, its subject rich hippies sequestered in the titular luxury homes, haunted by the sensation that the flower-power dream is going wrong. The weirdest thing about it is its eerie prescience. A year after its release, a group of people not too dissimilar to those depicted in the song found out just how wrong the 60s counterculture could go. The spectre of the Manson murders hangs chillingly over the track, compounded by the fact that, on their eponymous 1966 album, the Mamas and the Papas recorded Strange Young Girls, about precisely the kind of lost souls that Charles Manson would ultimately convince to do the devil’s work. A minor but thoroughly unsettling slice of buried pop history. There’s a well-known cognitive bias where, after you become aware of something new, you start seeing it everywhere. It’s known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, but from this year, I’ll think of it as the effect, after Katy on a Mission became the unexpected soundtrack of my summer. Having spent my teens and early 20s in New Zealand, I’d never heard it before; I first clocked it at Glastonbury, when two friends and I stumbled on Katy B’s set at the Shangri-La stage at 4am. “Stumbled” is the word: I didn’t learn its title until three weeks later, at a house party with the same friends. Handed control of Spotify, they agreed: Katy on a Mission. Two weeks later, I caught it again at Brighton Pride, the womp-womp bursting from the tent. Discovering this pop-dubstep classic has made me feel connected to a moment in British culture I missed, while coming across it in the wild 15 years later has felt like a second wind for my own youth. As much as I loved 2010s pop at the time, I now find much of it too saccharine to readily revisit. Katy on a Mission shares the era’s exuberance but tempers it with foreboding that now seems prescient. Since summer, I’ve had it on high rotation, making up for lost time. When Barcelona electro-punk duo Dame Area worked in the tiny club Màgia Roja, a hub for the city’s 2010s experimental scene attended by the likes of Arca and Björk, nights often closed with the dark, pounding Secondo Coro Delle Lavandaie. Sounding like an acoustic version of some industrial dance banger, it’s actually a piece from Neapolitan artist Roberto De Simone’s 1976 folk opera La Gatta Cenerentola, in which several washerwomen discuss a sex dream. Dame Area showed me that track years ago, calling it a major influence, and it’s so good I barely gave the rest of the musical a chance. When De Simone died this year, I finally listened to the whole 1976 recording, and kicked myself for not doing so sooner. This eccentric gem celebrates his city’s folklore – based on Giambattista Basile’s 1630s version of Cinderella – and musical traditions, from the Renaissance villanella to the wild folk dance of the tarantella. I was at a party when the DJ played an unfamiliar song from a familiar voice, which instantly sent my hips swinging as though I already knew every beat. I scrambled for the Shazam app and found that it was I Said It by Opal, a name I recognised from the lyrics of Mr Vegas’s dancehall classic Hot Fuk: “A Opal, Hottaball and Vegas!” I soon had the song on repeat, in love with its incredible lyrics – “Nookie well tight / It nuh quicksand” – then discovered it was from a six-track EP from 2012, You Ready. That record served me the track Physically Fit, set to the English nursery rhyme One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, which has become the soundtrack to my lifting sessions in the gym. What amazed me is how singularly inventive, playful and sexy this tight EP is and how little known it seems to be despite Opal’s voice being familiar to anyone who knows anything about dancehall; you can’t even find the lyrics or much reference to these songs online. It was released on the label Zojak, also home to Vybz Kartel’s global hits Fever and Summertime: I’ll be trawling through its catalogue for more vulgar, frisky, addictive hits. Ulver are the kind of fearless creatives more people should idolise. They started as part of Norway’s black metal scene before escaping not just the borders of that genre, but plenty more as well. Between albums, soundtracks and EPs, they’ve put out more than a dozen studio recordings, and they’ve run the gamut from contemporary classical to post-rock and synth-pop. All of it’s great. So, I was borderline giddy after I stepped into a secondhand shop and stumbled on a tattered copy of this CD/DVD of the band performing at their country’s opera house that I’d never heard of. When I put it on, I discovered that it wasn’t just some oddity, but Ulver in excelsis. It brought their avant garde spirit to new dimensions, using enigmatic video projections as well as interpretive performances from British artist Ian Johnstone. Whether the band were exploring the vaudevillian verve of In the Red or the spoken word of Plates 16–17, it all felt immersive and mystifying. The stats don’t lie: my most-played artist this year is one Bobby Zimmerman, spurred by in January. (In second? America’s next great bard, .) It stuck: on a long drive, Blonde on Blonde or Blood on the Tracks will inevitably find their ways on to the stereo. Last month, I went to see him live for the first time, figuring that his advanced 84 years might limit future chances. I’d heard so much about Dylan’s contemporary shows being formless dirges in which you might, four minutes into a song, suddenly get a recognisable snippet of It Ain’t Me Babe – albeit potentially in the style of Irving Berlin’s Puttin’ on the Ritz, as earlier this year. I was prepared for that to be the whole night, and to enjoy the latter-day Dylan experience for what it was: who am I to argue, showing my face this late in the day? But that night in Leeds, he played pristine versions of It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue and Desolation Row. Witnessing such classic 60-year-old songs feels like the gig equivalent of looking at the Mona Lisa or The Scream – getting to share these unbelievable moments of kismet with timeless, foundational art. (Equally captivating was watching this stubborn legend, who largely performed with his back turned, do human things like scrunch his hair and scratch his nose.) Maybe my favourite bit, though, was the spooked, still rendition of Key West (Philosopher Pirate) from 2020’s Rough and Rowdy Ways. I wish that alone had lasted an hour. Never mind the best old music I discovered in 2025: I sense this is a process that will see me through at least the next decade. four times in 2025. It’s a masterpiece, as is composer Daniel Blumberg’s Oscar-winning score – a sublime kaleidoscope of noise lurching between grandiosity and slipperiness. I listened to it a lot this year, but not as much as I listened to One for You, One for Me by Italian disco duo La Bionda, which plays over the credits. Extremely stupid but extremely catchy, with the squelchiest synth I’ve ever heard, it slaps in the simplest way a song can slap. Every time I left the cinema I was compelled to listen to it over and over, an addictive rush rendering critical thought impossible. The film ends with its complex narrative knowingly forced into a neat conclusion, wryly reflected in its switch from Blumberg’s tricksy score to novelty pop. Perhaps my smooth-brain response was conceptually engineered as part of this tone shift, but I can’t be mad when the song is this good. It’s no secret that I’m drawn to slightly naff provincial guitar music from the early 2000s (I’ve written glowing reviews of Keane and Hard-Fi at recent editions of Glastonbury), but this year I surprised myself by becoming totally enamoured with Once Around the Block by after hearing it played in a park in Serbia. Many will associate the track with singer-songwriter landfill, or the About a Boy soundtrack, which BDB composed and performed, but as someone who missed it the first time round, I find it extremely charming: the jaunty but melancholy melody, Damon Gough’s pained cadence, the airy backing vocals. It’s so twee and understated, you could imagine it being sung by the Marine Girls or some Sarah Records band, if you ignored the very real connotations of flannel shirts, beanies and open mic nights. I’m not bothered about the rest of Badly Drawn Boy’s music, but this song has had me in a chokehold. Despite not having a functioning record player for about two decades, my dad still has boxes of LPs gathering dust in his attic. Earlier this year while I was helping him make space so the ceilings wouldn’t cave in, I came across Labi Siffre’s 1972 album Crying Laughing Loving Lying and, intrigued by the live-laugh-love–style title, decided to take it home with me. Siffre had always been a name I associated with the mighty civil rights anthem (Something Inside) So Strong and had otherwise dismissed as some kind of one-hit wonder. Listening to Crying Laughing Loving Lying, I realised how embarrassingly wrong I was. Armed with an acoustic guitar and his yearning falsetto, Siffre’s 40-minute record led me through the emotions of its title, from crying to the sweet entreaties of My Song, to laughing at the coy lyrical twist of the title track, loving the rollicking rhythm on Cannock Chase – and lying since that I had always known about his masterful songwriting skill. It’s a record that has been on repeat for the rest of the year and has cemented Siffre as a national treasure in my mind. It’s rare that a cover version outstrips the original song, and even rarer that the cover and original are equally good. But the latter happened this year when cosmic techno producer Avalon Emerson did her superb version of Don’t Be Seen With Me by early 80s synthpop duo Oppenheimer Analysis. Using plenty of echo on her vocals alongside propulsive drum programming, her take is psychedelic and relentless, like the lights of a tunnel seen through a passenger window. I could scarcely believe the original, which I’d never heard before, would be a match for it. But it is, while being thoroughly different. It shares the same vocal melody and synth motif, but a heavy, bone-dry snare tolls like a portent throughout, and the production’s stiffer, more uptight bearing is a better match for the lyrics. It’s the tale of a person who, on realising that determinedly keeping people at arm’s length is no way to live, feels their old self disintegrate at the arrival of a charismatic newcomer. “Fresh from the cradle, you’re a passion lethal / Innocent smiles don’t mask the evil to a fool like me.” Is this person trying to exploit our narrator? Or is it all paranoid self-loathing from someone terrified of love and society? It’s a great bit of dancefloor storytelling, whatever form it takes. When I recently joined my 11th band, they gave me a list of 32 original songs to practise plus a few well-known covers they throw in at smaller gigs. On the list was Be the One … which I took to mean Dua Lipa’s hit from 2017. Playing along with it gave me an epiphany. This glorious electro-pop banger had somehow passed me by, although I wasn’t sure how it would transpose to my band’s indie-folk-pop setup. “What song?” they asked me, looking rather befuddled, at rehearsals. It turned out that they’d wanted me to learn the Ting Tings’ Be the One, a 2008 indie-pop hit which had also passed me by but which I’ve now discovered is a little gem. So far, it’s going down really well at gigs, but if the world ever cries out for an acoustic/guitar indie-folk-pop reinvention of Dua’s electro-pop colossus, I’m ready. . It’s not quite fair to say I “discovered” Dido this year. In fact, the first time I heard White Flag, I was roughly five years old and it happened, memorably, as I was tasting Heinz’s new green and purple ketchup. But I listened to her second album on a whim this year after listening to the new Snuggle album and marvelled at what a good Dido approximation their song Woman Lake is. As it turns out, Woman Lake only has the light perfume of Dido. The woman herself contains much more than featherweight power ballads: there’s the harried Balearic grooves of Sand in My Shoes; Mary’s in India, a song about – I believe – stealing your best friend’s man while she’s on holiday; and Paris, a dejected and atonal ballad that’s not too far removed from PJ Harvey at her starkest. I was mainlining Life for Rent for a few weeks, but I had to stop – a friend told me I was beginning to romanticise everyday life too much.",Ben Beaumont-Thomas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/mariupol-bombed-theatre-reopen-russification-ukraine,‘Dancing on bones’: Mariupol theatre to reopen with staging of Russian fairytale,2025-12-25T11:00:39.000Z,"Restoration presented as rebuilding, but many see it as part of a broader Russification effort in occupied Ukrainian city while hundreds of civilians were sheltering in its basement, is to open its doors again, with Russian occupation authorities heralding the reconstruction as a sign of renewal, while former actors at the theatre denounced the reopening as “dancing on bones”. The Kremlin has made the reconstruction of Mariupol a calling card of its rule in occupied , but Moscow’s oversight is accompanied by arrests or exile of critics, along with property seizures that have stripped thousands of Ukrainians of apartments they legally owned. The Mariupol Drama Theatre is due to reopen by the end of the month with a performance of The Scarlet Flower, a Russian fairytale, after being rebuilt almost from scratch over the past two years. “The theatre is being reborn together with Mariupol. Russian and Soviet classics have returned to the stage,” said the theatre in a statement about its plans for the future. Evgeny Sosnovsky, a photographer from Mariupol who worked extensively with the theatre but moved to Kyiv after the Russian takeover, said: “I can’t think of any other word for it than cynicism. There should be a memorial at the site in memory of the Mariupol residents who died during Russia’s capture of the city, not an entertainment venue.” The strike on the theatre remains one of the most notorious incidents of Russia’s war in Ukraine, with the building targeted despite the fact that “CHILDREN” had been painted in block letters in the square in front of it. At least a dozen people are confirmed to have died, but the real number is likely much higher. Russia has denied hitting the theatre and claimed the damage was caused by an explosion detonated inside the building, but several independent investigations have suggested Russian air bombs were responsible. Amnesty International concluded that the devastation was “likely caused by Russian forces deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians” and said the attack should be investigated as a war crime. “Having entertainment, songs and dances on top of all the bones? I have the feeling that the souls of the people who died there won’t let them perform well there,” said Vira Lebedynska, a former actor at the theatre. , in the western Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod. The calling card of the theatre-in-exile has been a play called Mariupol Drama, which is based on the events in February and March at the Mariupol theatre, and which has toured across Europe over the past year. “At the beginning, it was really difficult to perform in this, and I wondered why I have to remember all of this, but I carried on and I realised it was my mission to tell the world about what happened there in the theatre,” said Lebedynska. However, many other actors have remained in Mariupol and are collaborating with the new theatre. “For them, the main thing is acting on stage, and everything else is irrelevant. ‘We are outside of politics’ is their principle. They don’t care where they are, in Russia or Ukraine,” said Sosnovsky. The theatre’s former director stayed in Mariupol but has been demoted to run the orchestra, while Russian authorities have appointed Igor Solonin, formerly the deputy director of the Donetsk Circus, as the new head. In an interview earlier this year with a Russian journalist, Solonin repeated claims that the building was blown up from inside. “It was an internal explosion. It was a bomb or an explosive device inside the building, or maybe careless handling of ammunition,” he said. Several people who were in the theatre at the time of the explosion have told the Guardian there were no soldiers or military equipment there. Russia has undertaken a huge reconstruction programme in Mariupol, after its invasion reduced much of the city to rubble. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this month a decree allowing officials in occupied areas of Ukraine to confiscate homes left empty after their owners fled or were killed during Russia’s invasion. According to the document, dwellings deemed to show signs of “ownerless property” will be recognised as the property of regional authorities. Compensation is possible only for those who obtain Russian citizenship. There are now more than 12,000 apartments listed as ownerless, according to publicly available files from the Russian-installed Mariupol authorities. The Guardian spoke to several former Mariupol residents who said their property had been confiscated or was about to be. One, Volodymyr, said he owned an apartment in a building that was destroyed in the fighting and has since been rebuilt by Russian authorities. “On the door of the entrance, they posted a notice that they were waiting for the owners of the flats, who urgently needed to confirm their ownership or their apartments would be ‘nationalised,’” he said. The only way to make the confirmation would be to travel to Mariupol and take Russian citizenship. Sosnovsky said he had found his Mariupol apartment on the “ownerless” list, and has accepted he will lose the property. “I know that I will never return to Mariupol. In my lifetime, it is unlikely that it will return to Ukraine,” he said. “My wife and I are already over 60, so it’s unlikely. We are trying to start our lives from scratch in Kyiv. But there is absolutely no help or support from the state.” he added. One woman from Mariupol, who asked not to use her name, said she had managed to buy “the apartment of my dreams”, a modest flat in a Soviet-era apartment block in Mariupol, and had planned to begin renovations on it a few days before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The apartment block was damaged during the fighting, but has since been repaired. The woman asked her father, who still lives in the occupied territory, to take possession of the apartment, but was told that even with a power of attorney, she cannot transfer ownership to her father. “As far as I can tell there is no possibility if you don’t go there and take Russian citizenship,” she said, a step she is not willing to take. It is not only those who have left Mariupol for Ukrainian-controlled territory who are struggling to establish their property rights. Earlier this month, a woman who identified herself as Anna Guzevskaya, a Mariupol resident with three children, recorded a video appeal to Putin saying her house had been destroyed. Although this should have made her eligible for a new apartment, she had instead only been offered cash compensation which was nowhere near enough to buy a new apartment. “How should I explain to my children, that in the newly built apartment block there is no longer our apartment, where they have lived since their birth,” she asked Putin. Lebedynska, the actor, said her apartment in Mariupol had survived relatively unscathed, with just a few smashed windows. She heard in 2022 that other people had moved in, and has not made efforts to contact them since. “I’m not interested in who is there. Even if there was a theoretical chance I wouldn’t want to sell it. I have closed that place in my life, I have built a wall. The place is dead to me. Let them enjoy their ‘Russian World’,” she said.",Shaun Walker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/26/radu-lupu-the-unreleased-recordings-album-review-treasures-from-the-vaults-are-a-wonderful-surprise,Radu Lupu: The Unreleased Recordings album review – treasures from the vaults are a wonderful surprise,2025-12-26T06:00:01.000Z,"This six-disc collection to mark the late pianist’s 80th birthday is full of treats and includes rare ventures into Chopin and Copland, along with Lupu’s legendary rendition of Bartók at Leeds in 1969 irst, a personal declaration. Of the many hundreds of pianists I must have heard in more than 50 years of recital going, a multitude that has included many of the greatest names of the 20th century, none gave me more consistent pleasure or a greater sense of wonder than Radu Lupu. If ever a pianist’s appearance, especially in his later years, belied the character of his playing it was Lupu: that the intensely serious, heavily bearded figure who hunched over the keyboard in a way more appropriate to a seance than a recital could produce playing of such velvety tonal beauty was extraordinary enough; that such a beguiling sound world was allied to a mind of such penetrating musical intelligence sometimes seemed miraculous. Lupu died in 2022, at the age of 76. He had retired from the concert platform three years before, and had ceased to make studio recordings some years before that. Decca, for whom he recorded exclusively for over two decades, released his complete recordings in 2015, and with that comprehensive box, one thought, the legacy would be complete. But now, to mark what would have been the pianist’s 80th birthday, the company has produced this wonderful surprise: six discs made up of unreleased studio sessions and BBC, Dutch and SWR radio tapes, dating between 1970 and 2002, of works that Lupu otherwise did not record. The set begins with Mozart’s G minor and E flat piano quartets, for which Lupu was partnered in 1976 by members of the Tel Aviv String Quartet, in performances of such pristine studio quality – Lupu at his most inward in the slow movements, dazzlingly buoyant in the finales – that it’s mystifying they have never previously been released. A 1990s disc of Schubert sonatas – the unfinished C major D840, and the D major D850 (in a surprisingly downbeat, almost angry performance) – complements the Lupu Schubert already in the catalogue, while a sequence of Haydn and Mozart sonatas from the 1970s and 80s ends surprisingly with Schumann’s Études Symphoniques, complete with its five “posthumous” variations. If those discs remain on more or less familiar Lupu territory then much of the rest of the set does not. He recorded little Chopin, but here is a thrillingly vivid (if not always technically immaculate) performance of the B minor Scherzo, while Lupu learned Bartók’s Out of Doors suite especially for the 1969 Leeds International Piano Competition, of which, half a century on, he remains the most celebrated winner. More uncharacteristic still is Copland’s Sonata, fierce and majestic, from the Aldeburgh festival in 1971, while Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition sees Lupu making a rare venture into the Russian repertory; it comes from a 1984 Dutch broadcast, his tone noticeably rawer, almost strident at times. In general, though, the recording quality serves the exemplary playing well enough; every track is a treat. This article includes content hosted on .

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/cp-scott-centenary-essay,CP Scott's centenary essay,2017-10-23T16:19:42.000Z,"In May 1921, the great Manchester Guardian editor CP Scott wrote a leading article to mark the centenary of the paper. The essay, published under the headline “A Hundred Years”, is still recognised around the world as the blueprint for independent journalism A hundred years is a long time; it is a long time even in the life of a newspaper, and to look back on it is to take in not only a vast development in the thing itself, but a great slice in the life of the nation, in the progress and adjustment of the world. In the general development the newspaper, as an institution, has played its part, and no small part, and the particular newspaper with which I personally am concerned has also played its part, it is to be hoped, not without some usefulness. I have had my share in it for a little more than fifty years; I have been its responsible editor for only a few months short of its last half-century; I remember vividly its fiftieth birthday; I now have the happiness to share in the celebration of its hundredth. I can therefore speak of it with a certain intimacy of acquaintance. I have myself been part of it and entered into its inner courts. That is perhaps a reason why, on this occasion, I should write in my own name, as in some sort a spectator, rather than in the name of the paper as a member of its working staff. In all living things there must be a certain unity, a principle of vitality and growth. It is so with a newspaper, and the more complete and clear this unity the more vigorous and fruitful the growth. I ask myself what the paper stood for when first I knew it, what it has stood for since and stands for now. A newspaper has two sides to it. It is a business, like any other, and has to pay in the material sense in order to live. But it is much more than a business; it is an institution; it reflects and it influences the life of a whole community; it may affect even wider destinies. It is, in its way, an instrument of government. It plays on the minds and consciences of men. It may educate, stimulate, assist, or it may do the opposite. It has, therefore, a moral as well as a material existence, and its character and influence are in the main determined by the balance of these two forces. It may make profit or power its first object, or it may conceive itself as fulfilling a higher and more exacting function. I think I may honestly say that, from the day of its foundation, there has not been much doubt as to which way the balance tipped so far as regards the conduct of the paper whose fine tradition I inherited and which I have had the honour to serve through all my working life. Had it not been so, personally I could not have served it. Character is a subtle affair, and has many shades and sides to it. It is not a thing to be much talked about, but rather to be felt. It is the slow deposit of past actions and ideals. It is for each man his most precious possession, and so it is for that latest growth of time the newspaper. Fundamentally it implies honesty, cleanness, courage, fairness, a sense of duty to the reader and the community. A newspaper is of necessity something of a monopoly, and its first duty is to shun the temptations of monopoly. Its primary office is the gathering of news. At the peril of its soul it must see that the supply is not tainted. Neither in what it gives, nor in what it does not give, nor in the mode of presentation must the unclouded face of truth suffer wrong. Comment is free, but facts are sacred. “Propaganda”, so called, by this means is hateful. The voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard. Comment also is justly subject to a self-imposed restraint. It is well to be frank; it is even better to be fair. This is an ideal. Achievement in such matters is hardly given to man. Perhaps none of us can attain to it in the desirable measure. We can but try, ask pardon for shortcomings, and there leave the matter. But, granted a sufficiency of grace, to what further conquests may we look, what purpose serve, what tasks envisage? It is a large question, and cannot be fully answered. We are faced with a new and enormous power and a growing one. Whither is the young giant tending? What gifts does he bring? How will he exercise his privilege and powers? What influence will he exercise on the minds of men and on our public life? It cannot be pretended that an assured and entirely satisfactory answer can be given to such questions. Experience is in some respects disquieting. The development has not been all in the direction which we should most desire. , perhaps almost the chief virtue, of a newspaper is its independence. Whatever its position or character, at least it should have a soul of its own. But the tendency of newspapers, as of other businesses, in these days is towards amalgamation. In proportion as the function of a newspaper has developed and its organisation expanded, so have its costs increased. The smaller newspapers have had a hard struggle; many of them have disappeared. In their place we have great organisations controlling a whole series of publications of various kinds and even of differing or opposing politics. The process may be inevitable, but clearly there are drawbacks. As organisation grows personality may tend to disappear. It is much to control one newspaper well; it is perhaps beyond the reach of any man, or any body of men, to control half a dozen with equal success. It is possible to exaggerate the danger, for the public is not undiscerning. It recognises the authentic voices of conscience and conviction when it finds them, and it has a shrewd intuition of what to accept and what to discount. This is a matter which in the end must settle itself, and those who cherish the older ideal of a newspaper need not be dismayed. They have only to make their papers good enough in order to win, as well as to merit, success, and the resources of a newspaper are not wholly measured in pounds, shillings, and pence. Of course the thing can only be done by competence all round and by that spirit of cooperation right through the working staff which only a common ideal can inspire. There are people who think you can run a newspaper about as easily as you can poke a fire, and that knowledge, training, and aptitude are superfluous endowments. There have even been experiments on this assumption, and they have not met with success. There must be competence, to start with, on the business side, just as there must be in any large undertaking, but it is a mistake to suppose that the business side of a paper should dominate, as sometimes happens, not without distressing consequences. A newspaper to be of value should be a unity, and every part of it should equally understand and respond to the purposes and ideals which animate it. Between its two sides there should be a happy marriage, and editor and business manager should march hand in hand, the first, be it well understood, just an inch or two in advance. Of the staff much the same thing may be said. They should be a friendly company. They need not, of course, agree on every point, but they should share in the general purpose and inheritance. A paper is built up upon their common and successive labours, and their work should never be task work, never merely dictated. They should be like a racing boat’s crew, pulling well together, each man doing his best because he likes it, and with a common and glorious goal. That is the path of self-respect and pleasure; it is also the path of success. And what a work it is how multiform, how responsive to every need and every incident of life! What illimitable possibilities of achievement and of excellence! People talk of “journalese” as though a journalist were of necessity a pretentious and sloppy writer; he may be, on the contrary, and very often is, one of the best in the world. At least he should not be content to be much less. And then the developments. Every year, almost every day, may see growth and fresh accomplishment, and with a paper that is really alive, it not only may, but does. Let anyone take a file of this paper, or for that matter any one of half a dozen other papers, and compare its whole make-up and leading features today with what they were five years ago, ten years ago, twenty years ago, and he will realise how large has been the growth, how considerable the achievement. And this is what makes the work of a newspaper worthy and interesting. It has so many sides, it touches life at so many points, at every one there is such possibility of improvement and excellence. To the man, whatever his place on the paper, whether on the editorial, or business, or even what may be regarded as the mechanical side – this also vitally important in its place – nothing should satisfy short of the best, and the best must always seem a little ahead of the actual. It is here that ability counts and that character counts, and it is on these that a newspaper, like every great undertaking, if it is to be worthy of its power and duty, must rely.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/22/the-10-best-experimental-albums-of-2025,The 10 best experimental albums of 2025,2025-12-22T07:00:23.000Z,"Raisa K’s solo album is primitive and intimate, Saeko Killy adds a euphoric touch to her dimly lit sound and Bitchin Bajas get blissed out Chicago minimalist trio Bitchin Bajas are experts in crafting the ultimate slow burn, with a discography full of soundscapes that often stretch languorously around or beyond the 10-minute mark. Their latest record follows suit with four winding, blissed-out tracks over a 40-minute run time. But it’s not just overindulgent lounge music: the analogue loops quietly build to transcendental heights, nudged along by wandering sax solos, spritely keys and other cosmic flourishes. It’s a lush, often moving odyssey which, towards the end of the epic 18-minute closer, climaxes in an effervescent flurry. In 2024, Trystero emerged seemingly out of nowhere with an album that sounded like it had been ripped straight from a lost 80s tape, marrying moody krautrock and downtempo dance music. The now-expanded group of Luxembourg musicians (who met through a residency on a barge in France) carry the same hypnotic formula to this year’s follow-up, but with an added stroke of lightness and a fun dancefloor kick. Here, there are also shades of acid house and big beat: playful percussion, euphoric synth stabs and baggy basslines energise the dense, swirling instrumentals. Much like her collaborators in the Curl Recordings universe and their post-punk predecessors, south London musician Alpha Maid twists the guitar into janky, angular shapes on this battered but brilliant album. Across its nine tracks, simple hooky riffs and reverb-heavy meanderings coalesce with other DIY elements, including grimy, off-kilter loops and squawking sax flourishes from experimental composer Ben Vince. At points it’s pleasingly melodic (6-9, 2 Numbers), at others, things get out-of-hand, as in Why We Have to Move, which features the frenzied drums of percussionist Valentina Magaletti. Even at its most chaotic, Alpha Maid’s vocal delivery remains dry and effortlessly cool. Saeko Killy has built a reputation in underground music circles for her swampy, downtempo productions, which sound suited to some otherworldly late-night dancefloor. On her second album, Killy offsets her signature dimly lit sound with a euphoric touch: dreamy Japanese and English vocals, arpeggiated synths and birdsong samples weave in and out of dubby basslines and swathes of echo. Alongside these chugging excursions, there are also references to 80s guitar music – tracks such as Next Time and Melancholic have a skippy post-punk vibe, complete with krautrock-y psychedelic spirals – and hints of functional dance music. But even the most club-adjacent tracks have a dizzying effect. Berlin-based musician Chris Imler conjures all the dark, heady feelings of too much time spent on the internet on this record – and it’s just as moreish. Compounding elements of krautrock, post-punk and downtempo dance music, the tracks often sound as seedy and stuffy as their subject matter: he chants the miscellaneous contents of a late-night doomscroll over an eerie robotic loop on Liturgy of Litter, and jackknifes from war into sex in the chugging Let’s Not Talk About the War. Standout single Agoraphobie (featuring underground experimentalist Naomie Klaus) is also suitably, and brilliantly, claustrophobic. After more than a decade in bands and various DIY projects (most notably Good Sad Happy Bad), south London musician Raisa K made her first big solo outing this year with her debut album Affectionately. Written between a busy work and parenting schedule, and produced entirely on her laptop, the record is as primitive and intimate as a diary entry. K’s lyrics are plain and her delivery is cool, almost deadpan, as she ruminates over the sweet sentiments and everyday dramas of relationships: on the title track, she mumbles “we never have anything to talk about” over and over, like an absent-minded mantra. Her woozy melodies, made from rickety drum loops and scuzzy electronics, are just as low key and charming. One of the first things you’re struck by in Sacred Lodge’s second album is his growling, death-metal-pitched voice: sometimes it’s the centrepiece – dense and in your face – and at other times it’s just texture, stalking around his foreboding instrumentals through echo-laden yelps and cries. Inspired by the tradition of field hollers and ritual chants, the vocals are one of the Paris-based sound artist’s nods to his ethnological research, which focuses on ethnomusicology and his own Equatoguinean heritage. The sense of urgency is sustained elsewhere, too: through the turbulent drums, the steely, horrorcore-influenced electronics and the deep, murky low end. It’s a thrilling listen. The 11-track debut album by south London-based experimentalist feeo is a great introduction to an exciting, shapeshifting artist. There are echoes of her improvisational project Grain Residency in these droning compositions, which fuzz and mutate, punctuated by spoken word features and field recordings. They also show off feeo’s talent as a vocalist. She has a gorgeous voice, which saunters between eerie, breathy whispers and full-on mellifluous croons. Parallels could be drawn to a generation of alt-electronic musicians such as Sampha and James Blake, but these warped tracks feel uniquely innovative. The dreamy, downtempo sounds of trip-hop have been ubiquitous this year, in underground and commercial releases alike. Listless, the new album by Baghdad-born, Barcelona-based producer Dania, is one example, with slow, syncopated drum patterns and murky textures embedded throughout the synths and soft layered vocals. But it doesn’t feel like an opportune case of hopping on the bandwagon: the palette is perfectly matched to the album’s theme: written and recorded after midnight, and inspired by Dania’s experiences on night shifts as an emergency doctor, it is an atmospheric, occasionally brooding, musing on the nocturnal hours. For many years, Glasgow-based painter-musician Joanne Robertson has been making beautiful, understated songs using little more than her voice and acoustic guitar. It’s music that might sound straight-up pleasant if it wasn’t tinged with only the slightest streak of the uncanny (an element that makes her an ideal match for past collaborator Dean Blunt). Her new album is full of gorgeous, wandering tracks with a warm but ghostly atmosphere: stray guitar strums flicker beneath Robertson’s soft voice, which is sometimes shy, sometimes yearning. It’s a simple formula, but somehow it’s full of feeling. The fact that many of the tracks sound as if they were recorded at home, bookended with string squeaks and amp echoes, only adds to the intimacy.",Safi Bugel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/25/ice-by-jacek-dukaj-review-a-dazzling-journey-to-an-alternate-siberia,Ice by Jacek Dukaj review – a dazzling journey to an alternate Siberia,2025-12-25T07:00:35.000Z,"The 1908 Tunguska comet changes the direction of history and gives rise to a weird new reality in this acclaimed epic from the Polish author he opening sentence of this remarkable novel announces that the reader is in for an intriguing experience. “On the fourteenth day of July 1924, when the tchinovniks of the Ministry of Winter came for me, on the evening of that day, on the eve of my Siberian Odyssey, only then did I begin to suspect that I did not exist.” It may hint at Kafka in the ominous arrival of officials, or Borges in its metaphysical conundrum, but stranger things are afoot. In 1924 there was no tsar, let alone his bureaucrats, the tchinovniks. The date is significant, but I don’t mind admitting I had to find out why online. The time, as Hamlet says, is out of joint. The rudely awakened sleeper is Benedykt Gierosławski, a Polish philosopher, logician, mathematician and gambler whose debts will be erased if he undertakes a special mission for the Ministry. He is to travel to Siberia, “the wild east”, and find his father, Filip, who was exiled there for anti-government activities. This is not clemency. Filip is now known as Father Frost, and as a geologist, radical and mystic, he might have a connection with what has occurred. The reader is drip-fed the details. A comet fell into Tunguska in Siberia in 1908, as it did in our universe. But here the event has caused the emergence of an inexplicable, expanding, possibly sentient coldness called the “gleiss”. Ice, which won the European Union prize for literature, came out in Poland in 2007, well before the Game of Thrones TV adaptation made “winter is coming” a meme; but in this novel, it certainly is. The “black physics” caused by the comet’s impact has created new materials and technologies: superconducting “coldiron”, “frostoglaze” and “blackwickes” that emit “unlicht”. More than that, it has created an entirely new geopolitical situation. Neither the Russian Revolution nor the first world war has taken place. It is not just history that has been reconfigured: ideology has also been transformed. The great fissure is between the Ottepyelniks, who advocate Thaw, and the Lyednyaks, who wish to preserve the gleiss. This is not a simple transposition of the idea of a “cold war”. Some Siberian entrepreneurs rely on the gleiss for their technological advantage, while others see in its absolute frozen stasis a kind of religious transcendence. The tsar seems to favour its elimination, with Russia becoming part of a European “Summer” cluster of powers. The gleiss sharpens dichotomies: Slavophiles and westernisers, imperial tsarists against Polish and Siberian nationalists, anarchists against autarchs, materialists against spiritualists. Benedykt, as a gambler and scientist, is intrigued by how chance operates under the gleiss. Basically, randomness and probabilities are certainties; quantum fuzziness becomes crystal clear. He is not alone in his fascination: a fellow passenger on his journey is none other than Nikola Tesla. And Tesla is not alone as a real person in the fiction: we meet Aleister Crowley, Trotsky and Rasputin, among others. The novel has three acts; firstly, Benedykt on the Trans-Siberian express train (there are plots, deaths, spies, double agents), then his time in the political hotbeds and laboratories of Irkutsk, then finally his journey into the wastes along the mysterious “Ways of the Mammoth”. The publishers should be commended for giving the translator, Ursula Phillips, an appendix in which to discuss her translation. Her choices, compromises and ingenuity are made clear, especially since the style reflects Gierosławski’s opening, where Benedykt thinks he might not exist. The first person, the “I”, is therefore dropped: “Stand facing … release air from the lungs …” Phillips argues against accusations of “untranslatability”, though the cultural references are problematic to convey. But her decisions provide an anchor for the reader amid an almost obligatory obliquity. A novel about the world’s complexity needs to be complicated; the truth is sometimes slant. It is telling that Dukaj recommended Phillips read Thomas Pynchon’s Mason & Dixon during her work. Ice is not just a cerebral romp. There are moments of hilarity and horror; chapters full of pathos, a moment unfurling a life of regrets. It is a gloomy, sharp, dazzling work. If things had been different, Dukaj asks, would they just turn out the same? Ice by Jacek Dukaj, translated by Ursula Phillips, is published by Head of Zeus (£25).

The Global Chess League, now in its third season, is planned as the chess equivalent of cricket’s Indian Premier League. The final qualifying match, in which Alpine barely secured the six game points needed to edge their opponents, proved a triumph for Hou, who studied at Oxford and is semi-retired from chess in favour of a professorship at Peking University. She scored four wins in a row, including a which took her team into the final. The key takeaway from this game is the red flag when White is uncastled and Black pushed h7-h6, provoking a g2-g4 advance supported by a g1 rook. Commentator Daniil Dubov said: “It’s probably better not to make a move rather than play h7-h6.” The noncommittal 7…d6 is far preferable. As played, White is already winning after 11 Qg3. 11…Nxg5 would slow down the attack, but 12 Bxg5 hxg5 13 h4 g4 14 Qxg4 is strong.

It’s an old home movie showing a boy and a girl on Christmas morning eagerly unwrapping a present that turns out to be an N64 console – the boy is, to put it mildly, extremely pleased. It’s a scene a lot of us who play games will recognise: the excitement and anticipation provided by that big console-sized parcel, or the little DVD-shaped package that could be the latest Super Mario adventure. Although I never got a games machine at Christmas, I remember one year being given Trivial Pursuit on the Commodore 64 and the whole family gathered around the TV to play. It was one of the few times my mum and my sisters showed any interest in the computer, and I loved getting them involved. Veteran designer Rhod Broadbent of Dakko Dakko recalls the Christmas of 1992, when his father, a programmer who had previously looked down on games consoles, bought him Mario Kart and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. “Zelda was completely unknown to me at the time,” he recalls. “I think Dad was probably expecting me to be more excited. But after I had spent the morning in Mario Kart, I plugged in Zelda and everything changed. From the title music, through the intro and into that beautiful initial thunderstorm, everything was so polished and smooth and unlike the video games I’d played before. It didn’t leave the cartridge slot for weeks. I remember that Christmas morning like it was yesterday …” For Anna Hollinrake, founder of Electric Saint, Christmas gaming was an opportunity for sweet revenge. “As a competitive child with a guitarist father, I chose to learn the violin aged six so I could be better than him at something. However, he picked up my violin and immediately smashed out a few pieces way above my level. Years later, Christmas morning 2007, I unwrapped Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Imagine my delight as I watched my dad catastrophically miss every note on . Oh, how the tables turned, father. Who’s the musician now?!” The memories don’t always end so happily. Sam Barlow, creator of , recalls when he and his brother used to wait until everyone was in bed on Christmas Eve before sneakily squeezing and shaking all their presents. “One year my brother fishes out a thick rectangular present – exactly the shape of a Super Nintendo game box. We were so excited, we got very little sleep thinking about what game it could be. Skip to the morning, he carefully peels open the wrapping, teasing out the reveal … only to discover a Ghostbusters card game. His utter disappointment was the funniest thing I’ve seen. To this day in our family, ‘Ghostbusters card game’ is used as shorthand for those occasions when life fails to meet our expectations.” But there were also times when disappointment turned to delight. Video game writer Alex Donaldson at Eurogamer recalls being desperate for a PC, but his parents couldn’t afford it so got him a Sega Mega Drive instead. “I quickly set it up and loaded the Mega compilation cart,” he says. “Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi … Everything was so immediate, so visceral. This wasn’t a PC, it was . I always remember that feeling – there is a beautiful simplicity to the console.” Some of us have found ways to keep treasured Christmas gaming experiences alive. I can dig out Singstar and relive festive karaoke sessions of old, while Lucy Blundell of Kinmoku Games (One Night Stand, Videoverse) has a collection of vintage consoles to call upon. “Last Christmas morning, my husband and I snuggled on the beanbags with our dog, plugged in our Japanese Sega Saturn and played Christmas NiGHTS,” she says. “Afterwards, we booted up the Nintendo 64 – the very same console I received for Christmas back in 1999 – and played my favourite Christmas games: Diddy Kong Racing’s winter levels and Super Mario 64, which I bought on Boxing Day in 1999. Spending a quiet Christmas together and sharing our favourite childhood games was a real festive treat!” Last week, I asked on BlueSky for people’s Christmas gaming memories, and what really touched me was how many recalled being given secondhand machines, with bundles of games – and being delighted. A Commodore 128, a Nintendo Wii … the thrill was in having so many new experiences to try, not just the one game that comes with a new console. Christmas for a gamer isn’t always about the flashiest, newest, most expensive things. It can be a few hours of shared fun with whatever machine you have to hand.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/28/techscape-ai-google-meta-amazon,The trillion-dollar AI arms race is here,2025-07-29T21:04:08.000Z,"Google, Amazon and Meta are pouring billions into AI infrastructure, but at what cost to the planet, creatives, and the grid? Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Johana Bhuiyan and Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who’s enjoying the beach but likely getting sunburned. Tech companies are fighting to claim the title of having the world’s most advanced AI. The goal is to supercharge their bottom line and keep investors and Wall Street happy. But developing the world’s most advanced AI means spending billions on data centers and other physical infrastructure to house and power the supercomputers needed for AI. It also means a and the grid in the areas surrounding data centers worldwide. Still, last week’s earnings reports made clear that tech firms are forging ahead. Google it was planning to spend $85bn on building out its AI and cloud infrastructure just in 2025 – $10bn more than it initially predicted. And the company expects that spending to increase again in 2026. For context, Google reported $94bn in revenue in the second quarter of this year. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said Google is in a “tight supply environment” when it comes to the infrastructure needed to support AI processing and compute. The results of this increased spending would still take years to be realized, he said. it plans to spend $100bn in 2025 – the “vast majority” of which will go to powering the AI capabilities of its cloud division. As a point of comparison, Amazon spent just under $80bn in 2024. “Sometimes people make the assumption that if you’re able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component … that somehow it leads to less total spend in technology,” said Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy during an earnings call in February. “We’ve never seen that to be the case.” it plans to spend on AI infrastructure. In June, Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to spend “hundreds of billions” of dollars on building out a network of massive data centers across the US including one that the firm expects to be up and running in 2026. Originally, executives said the firm was projected to spend $65bn in 2025 but adjusted that to anywhere between $64bn and $72bn. Meta and Amazon report earnings this week. Artificial intelligence companies have come under fire for cannibalizing creative industries. Artists have seen their work used without their permission as companies train their algorithms. Creative teams have shrunk and been laid off as parts of their work are being done by AI. “It will mean that 95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists, and creative professionals for today will easily, nearly instantly, and at almost no cost be handled by AI,” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, In response, coalitions of artists have against the top AI companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google and Anthropic. The companies say that under the “fair use” doctrine they should be able to use copyrighted material for free and without consent. Artists, including names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, say the companies shouldn’t be able to profit off their work. So far, the Adobe, the software company best known for making creative tools such as Photoshop, says it’s trying to walk the line between developing useful AI programs and making sure artists aren’t getting the short end of the stick. The company has introduced two “creator-safe” tools, that aim to tackle issues around copyright and intellectual property. One is its Firefly AI model, which Adobe says is trained only on licensed or public-domain content. The other is the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which lets photographers and other visual artists indicate when they don’t want their work to be used to train AI and also lets them add credentials to their digital creations. Artists can “apply a signature to it in the same way that a photographer might sign a photo or a sculptor would etch their initials into a sculpture”, said Andy Parsons, a senior director at Adobe who oversees the company’s work on content authenticity. We spoke with Parsons about the burgeoning world of AI and what it means for creators. I think there’s one prevailing issue, which is the concern that various AI techniques will compete with human ingenuity and with artists of all kinds. And that goes for agencies, publishers, individual creators. Yeah, absolutely. From the beginning of Adobe Firefly, we followed two guiding principles. One is to make sure that Adobe Firefly is not trained on publicly available content. It’s only trained on things that Adobe and the Firefly team have exclusive rights to use. That means that it can’t do certain things. It cannot make a photo of a celebrity, because that celebrity’s likeness we would consider guarded and potentially protected. The second thing we built in from the beginning is transparency, so knowing that something that comes out of Firefly was generated by AI. This is what we call content provenance, or content authenticity. It’s making clear something is a photograph or made by an individual artist as opposed to made by AI. It’s a combination of Adobe Stock and some licensed datasets. It’s trained on things that Adobe has clear rights to use in this manner. We have licensed and clear rights to all of the data that goes into that dataset. There’s an entire team devoted to trust, safety and assurances that the material is available to be used. We don’t crawl the open web, because as soon as you do that, you do risk potentially infringing on someone’s intellectual property. Our feeling is it’s not always the case that more training data is better. When it comes to content authenticity, there’s that “nutrition label” idea we sometimes talk about. If you walk into a food store, you have a fundamental right that’s fulfilled in most democratic societies, to know what’s in the food that you’re going to serve your family. And we think the same is true of digital content. We have a fundamental right to know what it is. Last week, the internet in the UK underwent a seismic change. As of Friday, social media and other internet platforms will be required to implement safety measures protecting children or face large fines. It is a significant test for the Online Safety Act, a landmark piece of legislation that covers the likes of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and",Johana Bhuiyan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/25/premier-league-efl-talks-saturday-3pm-blackout-football-tv-rights,Premier League and EFL to hold talks over ending Saturday 3pm blackout,2025-12-25T12:00:39.000Z,"Leagues eager to sell all games in next rights cycle Auction for televised rights expected in 2027 The Premier League and EFL will hold talks early next year about combining to permit 3pm Saturday kick-offs to be broadcast live each week for the first time. The UK is the last country in Europe to apply the so-called 3pm blackout, and with the Premier League and EFL eager to sell all their games to domestic broadcasters in the next rights cycle they want an early agreement before the next tender. The Premier League and EFL are respectively showing a record 270 and 1,059 of their matches on domestic TV this season, mostly on Sky Sports, but have concluded that selling every game is the only way to bring in more revenue. Although their contracts do not expire until the end of the 2028-29 season, the EFL is planning to go to market at the start of 2027 and needs to know what it can offer. The Premier League auction is expected to take place later the same year. is worth £935m over five years, giving the broadcaster exclusive live rights to 1,059 games each season from the Championship, League One, League Two, the Carabao Cup and EFL Trophy. The EFL could make all 1,891 of its matches available if it reaches an agreement with the Premier League and Football Association over removing the blackout. The Premier League is also keen to explore selling every game given the declining value of media rights across Europe. Although its domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a record £6.7bn over four years, the league added an extra year to the contract and increased the number of games from 215 to 270 each season, so the real-terms value has declined by 23% from the previous cycle between 2022 and 2025. Many of the Premier League clubs’ American owners have been pushing to broadcast every game for some time, as happens in every sport in the US. The blackout relates to Article 48 of Uefa’s statutes, under which the transmission of live football in a territory can be prohibited for “two and a half hours on a Saturday or a Sunday”. It applies in an English leagues context when 50% of Premier League and Championship matches are scheduled for Saturday at 3pm, a proviso that enabled the EFL to televise all its games on the opening weekend this season because the Premier League did not begin until the following week. The FA, which is responsible for applying to Uefa to impose Article 48 if asked to do so by the leagues, is unlikely to object to the blackout being dropped. Last season there were discussions at the FA about the Women’s Super League being exempted from the blackout, which is in place between 2.45pm and 5.15pm on Saturday, but the Premier League and EFL raised concerns on legal grounds. Article 48 is enforced in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales so if it is lifted the Premier League and EFL may face demands for compensation from the leagues there. In the event of Article 48 no longer applying in England, 3pm Premier League kick-offs would be broadcast across the UK, which could have a negative effect on attendances.",Matt Hughes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This question has been occupying me since 2014, when the Guardian first asked me to contribute to its . My job was to look for a France-based talent born in 1997 who could go on to have a stellar career. After a great deal of research, I narrowed it down from my shortlist of five by asking questions not about the players’ football ability, but about other attributes: resilience, adaptability, decision-making, creativity, work ethic, response to feedback and willingness to learn. Qualities we cannot see, and are harder to measure. Based on those answers, one player stood out above all the others: a kid called Ousmane Dembélé, then a youth player yet to make a first-team appearance at Rennes. Eleven years after appearing in these pages as one to watch, Dembélé has been voted the by the Guardian’s 219-strong voting panel. Those intangible qualities were in full effect on the night Dembélé made good on his years of promise. The defining image of in the 2025 Champions League final was not the trophy lift, or any one of the goal celebrations, but Dembélé, poised on the edge of the opposition penalty area, with hunched demeanour and furrowed brow, his face a picture of focus, ready to press. Just how did he get to this point? One lesson to learn from the Dembélé story: the path to greatness is not always linear. He started off like a train, winning France’s young player of the year award in his first season as a professional. The following season, he helped Borussia Dortmund win the German Cup. Around that time, in the course of research for my book, Edge, I spoke to Thomas Tuchel, his coach at Dortmund. Tuchel told me that Dembélé’s talent came with an obligation and responsibility to improve. He bracketed his players into one of three “ABC” categories, depending on their dominant motivation, and would change his man-management style accordingly. The A category stood for “aggressive-motivated”, and referred to players motivated by individual glory and awards (in Tuchel’s eyes, this was not necessarily a negative: think Neymar at Paris). B stood for “binding-motivated”, those players who love being part of the group and bringing people together (often captains, such as César Azpilicueta at Chelsea). C stood for “curious-motivated”. These were the players capable of greatness, who needed to be trained in a slightly different way. Their talent could take them far; and on a good day, they were capable of anything. Tuchel loved coaching these players. Dembélé, he felt, was a C. But the journey was not always smooth. In 2017, , who were flush with money from selling Neymar for €222m (£194m). It was a sliding doors moment. That same summer, Barcelona changed coach: ; out went Luis Enrique. In six injury-laden years at Barcelona, Dembélé started only a third of the league games. He scored a total of 24 league goals. His most memorable moment might have been missing a last-minute one-on-one in the , when Barcelona were already 3-0 up (remember what happened next? ). When he did leave, amid mutterings of wasted talent and , it felt like a relief for all parties. There is some symmetry to Dembélé’s exceptional 2025. Of the 30 goals he has scored this calendar year at the time of writing, the most decisive and emblematic was probably against Liverpool in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. With PSG 1-0 down from the first leg, Dembélé drifted into his own half, losing his markers who didn’t want to follow him that far. He picked up the ball and spread it wide to the right-winger Bradley Barcola, then sprinted into the box and made it to the cross to score. (He also scored a penalty in that night). Dembélé did something similar against Arsenal in the semi-final, dropping deep early in the game, switching the play to the left-sided Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and receiving the return ball, unmarked, on the edge of the area, before scoring. Even when teams knew it was coming, they couldn’t stop him. At the start of last season, Luis Enrique’s plan was for the whole team to replace the goals of Kylian Mbappé, who had joined Real Madrid. After all, Dembélé had not scored more than 10 league goals in a season since his debut campaign at Rennes. Luis Enrique wanted the team to be the star. And so, with no star player to serve, Dembélé was liberated. This curious-motivated talent who once scored penalties with either foot, and even took corners with either foot, quietly became the main man. He starts the press; his vision, movement, pace, control and positioning set the tone; and his finishing, once considered wasteful, is ruthless. I still don’t know exactly what makes a good player great but I am closer to an answer. Part of the equation remains what we cannot see: the chemistry within a team, the relationship with a specific coach, playing in a system that brings out the best in every player. But those other qualities that Dembélé had at 17, and still has now. This well-deserved prize is as much for those attributes as it is for his goals and the trophies he helped Paris Saint-Germain win.",Ben Lyttleton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mainoo has a calf problem that rules him out of Newcastle’s visit to Old Trafford on Boxing Day but Amorim offered his firmest backing yet for a player he has not started in any of United’s 17 Premier League matches. The head coach said: “He is going to be the future of Manchester United. That is my feeling. So you [Mainoo] just need to wait for each chance and everything can change in football in two days. He will have the opportunity that he has all the time to force his way in.” Amorim pointed to Mainoo’s ability to play a variety of roles. “The position of Casemiro [No 6], he can do it. He can play if we play with three in midfield. He can play like we play in the position of Mason Mount [No 10].” Amorim said this month he was for Mainoo, who the United hierarchy , but has now indicated a move would be possible only if a replacement were signed. “If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave,” he said. With the United captain, Bruno Fernandes, out for a prolonged period with an injury and Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo – two possible No 10s – at the Africa Cup of Nations, Mainoo may get more game time when fit. Amorim has previously suggested he may change from his 3-4-3 system. The Portuguese expanded on why, saying: “We can play a different way to take more quality from these players because I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and we need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.” Casemiro and Harry Maguire are each in the final year of their contracts and Amorim was asked whether a decision has been made on either player. The Brazilian’s deal has a one-year option but his weekly salary of around £365,000 makes him United’s highest earner and means it is unlikely an extension will be triggered. “We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season – if there will be the European games,” Amorim said. “At this moment, we are not thinking about that. I’m really happy with them.” Amorim was glowing in his praise of Casemiro’s work ethos. “If everyone trains like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in training, in set pieces training, even when they are playing 10-versus-goalkeeper, and the movements that he made imagining the game, we will be a top team.”",Jamie Jackson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/18/fifa-world-cup-2026-ticket-prices-prize-money,Do World Cup teams really need a 50% prize money hike after tickets furore?,2025-12-18T08:00:31.000Z,"Fifa has made big mistakes over 2026 tournament but it can afford to slash prices and even give some tickets away Who is the World Cup for? Fifa appeared to share some of its thinking on this topic in the past week. On the one hand, there was the revelation that spectators are being asked to pay for match tickets than they were in Qatar. On the other, the news that prize money for competing teams is to on four years ago. Stakeholders are doing good! Fans? Not so good. It hasn’t taken long for some of those watching to wonder whether things could be done differently. Tom Greatrex, the chair of the Football Supporters’ Association, which represents fans in England and Wales, argued that the ability to pay expanded prize money, itself a result of expanded revenue, showed “there is no need to charge extortionate ticket prices to the supporters who bring the vibrancy to the World Cup”. You could go so far as to say there was never a real need to do it in the first place. Here’s one version of what could happen next. Given the 37 members of the Council are in Doha, likely enjoying some of the best of Qatari hospitality on the back of Wednesday’s official meeting, it wouldn’t be hard to arrange an extra day of deliberation. Commandeer a meeting room in a six-star establishment, crack open the pomegranate Red Bulls, and get to work. First off, correct the most offensive part of this whole thing and redistribute some of the expanded prize money into slashing ticket prices for disabled supporters and their companions across the piece (currently, there is no discounting at all). Second, give free match tickets – 300 a match, say – to fans who lug drums and flags and face paint halfway across the world to provide 90 minutes of noise and colour (you could do this through associated fan groups such as the England Supporters Travel Club). As a third suggestion I’d say scrap dynamic pricing and ticket resales, but let’s not shoot for the moon. Once you’ve done that, the positive effects would start to flow. For the first time in a long time, Fifa would be perceived by the public as, in some way, a progressive organisation. Yes, Fifa is a not-for-profit organisation, one that does unacknowledged work sustaining the sport across the world and channels all its money back into the game (more on that in a moment). But so many have been the missteps, the failures and the downright egregious actions ( the most recent, failing to provide financial remedy for migrant workers in Qatar the most abhorrent), that it would be good for Fifa to do something that would stick in the mind of the public as half decent. In turn, it may free up space to ask some more existential questions. There is a debate, pursued by the Premier League among others, over whether governing bodies (such as Fifa) should also be running competitions. But this request is different: that Fifa should use any moment of grace to ask for whom they should be doing all this stuff. The model Fifa has created for this World Cup benefits itself, and by extension, its member associations. That’s where all the money goes. In some instances, those associations may exist in countries where – without Fifa’s assistance – there might not be the resources to create a national team worthy of the name. But in others – those most likely to benefit from the largesse of increased prize money – there’s enough money to sustain the game, and then some. Take Spain, for example. They are the world’s top-ranked side and have benefited from new Fifa rules that will keep them apart from teams ranked two, three and four until the semi-finals of the World Cup if they all win their groups. If they get no further than the semis, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) will receive $29m (£21.6m) in prize money. Meanwhile, on Monday, the RFEF announced its budget for 2026 (ie without new prize money taken in), and presented a sum of €403.5m (£353m), €87m of that being redistributed to its participating clubs. Some of those payments are made to those competing in the Spanish Super Cup, for which Saudi Arabia pay €40m each year for the hosting rights. and took home an estimated €9m. Does the RFEF need another $29m? Does England’s Football Association for that matter? No doubt they could do some good with the money, but – not beyond the bounds of reason – they could also fritter it away. More centrally, would the value accrued for the game by giving the money to a national association be greater or lesser than if that same cash was plugged directly into lowering the costs and increasing the accessibility of a sporting event that, rightly or wrongly, the world believes belongs to the people? It’s a mouthful of a question and, in all likelihood, not one that will echo repeatedly around the corridors of Fifa headquarters, on Fifa-Strasse, in Zurich. They’ve got a World Cup to put on. But the longer it goes unasked, never mind unanswered, the more antipathy among people who feel frozen out of the game will grow. And maybe, one day, all that money may just stop flowing.",Paul MacInnes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Members of the Confederation of African Football’s (Caf) executive committee, along with various other dignitaries including George Weah, the former Ballon d’Or winner and president of Liberia at the time, were assembled in Rabat at a seminar to hear Gianni Infantino outline his plan for the development of competitions and infrastructure in African football. As well as improving standards in refereeing and mobilising investment in the continent’s infrastructure, the president of Fifa floated the prospect of holding its most important tournament, the , every four years instead of every two and described the current arrangement as “useless”. The argument ran that it would be more beneficial for countries “at the commercial level” and would help to “project African football to the top of the world”. “Let us show the world what we can do,” added Infantino. “This day is special – it’s the start of a new chapter for African football.” More than five years on and Infantino has got his way. From 2028, a tournament that has caused big disruption to European leagues for more than three decades due to its scheduling in the middle of the domestic season will . That may be welcomed by many Premier League managers and sporting directors, but there are understood to be widespread fears within several African federations that they will lose out as a consequence, with 80% of Caf’s revenue having historically been drawn from Afcon. It was instructive to see Caf’s president, Patrice Motsepe, flanked by Fifa’s general secretary, Mattias Grafström, when he confirmed the plans on the eve of the latest edition of Afcon in Morocco at the weekend, despite stating in 2021 that he disagreed with Infantino because “we need the money”. Motsepe, the South African billionaire who also owns Mamelodi Sundowns and is thought to harbour political ambitions in his homeland, is banking on the launch of an annual African Nations League in 2029 to help to fill the gap. Caf also announced plans on Monday to increase its annual contributions to all 54 of its member associations from $200,000 to $1m (£742,000) a year and also promised that “financial resources will also be allocated to paying competitive salaries to Caf employees”. But it has yet to confirm what will happen to long-running competitions such as the African Nations Championship (Chan), a tournament reserved for players from Africa’s domestic leagues, or existing regional tournaments like the Cosafa Cup for teams in southern Africa. The role of Caf’s general secretary, Véron Mosengo-Omba, is believed to have been key to implementing Infantino’s will in this case. An old friend of the Fifa president since they studied law together at the University of Fribourg, theman from the Democratic Republic of Congo has been accused of running the confederation as his “proprietorship” and where employees are fired for speaking out against him. Mosengo-Omba has not responded to the allegations but he has exerted his control over Caf since moving from his role as Fifa’s chief member associations officer in March 2021, with insiders telling the Guardian that Motsepe has rarely visited its headquarters in Cairo. “In four years of his mandate, he only came twice and met the staff once,” one source said in October. It is understood that executives at IMG, the sports and marketing company that is now competing against Iris Sport Media (ISM) to be awarded a lucrative eight-year contract with Caf, have expressed concerns over the allegations made against Mosengo-Omba. Motsepe, for his part, has previously expressed “total confidence” in Mosengo-Omba. A move away from holding the tournament every two years also raises questions over whether Caf would still be able to demand $1bn from its negotiations with IMG and ISM given that a deal was thought to be dependent on the Afcon remaining a tournament played every two years. With scheduling squeezed even tighter by the introduction of two extra matches in European club competitions and Fifa’s new Club World Cup last year, Caf was forced to move Afcon to December after it had been scheduled to take place in the European close season. Not since the has the tournament taken place in its originally intended slot, with Infantino having hinted before the 2021 tournament in Cameroon that he would favour it being held in the newly expanded international window that is expected to run from roughly 21 September until 6 October, when it is introduced next year. How they would fit a 24-team tournament into three weeks remains anyone’s guess. Motsepe has been accused of being weak for failing to stand up to Infantino and Fifa. But despite more compelling evidence that African football is now being run from Zurich rather than on the continent, he insisted that closer “alignment and synchronisation” with the best domestic leagues will bring benefits. “I fought, but had to look at the facts, and have to compromise,” he said. “We want to ensure that African football players do not find themselves [as has often been the case] in the calendar or fixture conflict between their football clubs and their national teams.”",Ed Aarons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stewart will join the rapper Snoop Dogg and the footballer as a minority owner of the Welsh club, which plays in the second tier of England’s football pyramid. The announcement was made in a post on the club’s website by two of its owners, Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen. The post did not disclose the size of the investment. The move underlines the increasing influence in British football of US owners, who appear to be drawn by the strong heritage and potential financial returns, at least for clubs below the Premier League. , while Stewart attended last week’s against Wrexham AFC, a north Wales club that has secured three successive promotions thanks to the heavy financial backing of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, who has changed his name from Rob McElhenney.

Cravatt and Cohen said that “we do not expect the January window to be a particularly busy one for Swansea City” under . They pointed to Matos’s experience in developing young players. Cravatt and Cohen wrote: “We are very excited to welcome Martha onboard, and we know experiencing Friday night’s game in-person has only increased her own enthusiasm and anticipation for being part of Swansea City.” Swansea City have been owned by an American consortium since 2016, although Cravatt and Cohen took control last year.",Jasper Jolly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/17/football-sexism-rise-in-reports-kick-it-out,Football has seen a steep rise in reports of sexism – now we can break the cycle,2025-12-17T08:00:29.000Z,"If action is taken, the so-called ‘banter’ used to victimise women who take part in the sport will soon diminish fter six days in which a former player was held accountable in court for sexist comments and a current manager was with using sexist language, are we seeing a change in how that behaviour is tackled? For years, talk of so-called “banter” has been used to silence complaints and it has been a struggle to convince football that sexism and misogyny even exist, but there are signs the sport is finally waking up. for harmful social media posts targeting the pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko for doing their jobs. Aluko was targeted by racially charged posts, too. A few days earlier, Barnet’s Dean Brennan had become the first EFL manager to be charged with sexist abuse towards a female referee. He has denied the charge. That comes after cases in non-league in the past two months where where Hemel Hempstead Town were fined and a match at Coventry Sphinx was abandoned because of abuse towards female officials. This type of abuse is vile and nothing new, but the visibility of those outcomes is. It starts to send a message that this behaviour won’t be tolerated any more, which is hugely important in the context of the Kick Sexism Out campaign we at launched at the start of last season. Research we commissioned found that 85% of female fans who had experienced sexism in football settings never reported it. They felt nothing would be done or it wouldn’t be taken seriously, which is understandable. But when more positive outcomes are visible, as we’ve seen in the past month, it can help break the cycle, and perhaps encourage more women to report sexism when they witness it. This season, we have received 86 reports of sexism, helped by our new reporting relationship with Her Game Too. That’s nearly four times the number at this stage last year, including a record 19 involving mass chanting, and comes after setting records for professional, grassroots and online reports in each of the past three seasons. It may sound strange to say that an increase in sexism reports is positive, but we know it’s happening and now we are starting to see more people willing to call it out. We can use that to drive further outcomes, including clubs being charged for sexist chanting. We see this as recognition that women have had enough and are desperate for change. The reasons are staring us in the face. Sexism has become one of the fastest-rising forms of abuse in football, with female fans, referees, officials, physios and club staff regularly targeted. Chants reported to us have included “Get your tits out for the lads” and “She’s got chlamydia”. Fans have been subjected to comments such as: “Get back in the kitchen, you slag.” Officials have faced a barrage of lewd and abusive language when they take the field. It is a consistent narrative of women being told they don’t belong in football. It begs the question: where exactly does football want women to show up? This behaviour seeps into grassroots, too. I manage a girls’ academy side and we play in a boys’ league. We are the only girls’ team in the league and I’m the only female manager. Most teams are desperate to beat us, for fear of losing to girls – a sad insecurity more from the male managers than the young boys on the pitch, in my opinion. Playing against a team recently, we faced constant sexist remarks from spectators about girls not being “man enough” to play against boys and shouts of: “Don’t play against boys if you can’t act like boys.” All types of comments were shouted at me and my 12- and 13-year-old players, simply for us being present, by a pair of grown men – one of whom told me he had a daughter when I challenged him, so how could he possibly be sexist. Fair to say, I didn’t let that go. The behaviour in football environments feels unique to the sport at times. People often appear entitled and emboldened to say whatever they like to whoever they like, without fear of consequence. That’s the part we really have to change. So when we see more people calling it out and more accountability, it gives us more hope. There’s a long way to go, and reports will continue to rise, but momentum can build and everyone can play their part in standing up to sexism and misogyny.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/15/tottenham-hotspur-thomas-frank-premier-league,Thomas Frank is running out of time to fix Tottenham Hotspur,2025-12-15T15:40:56.000Z,"Spurs have faced low moments in their history, and this is one of them. How will the club respond in the post-Daniel Levy era? ottenham Hotspur, Thomas Frank said after Sunday’s , are “not a quick fix”. That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered). Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeat , 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008. It’s not just the results; it’s the manner of them. Only twice in their last 11 games have Spurs registered an xG of 1 or above. This season they’ve had four games when they’ve registered an xG of 0.3 or below: against Arsenal, Chelsea, Brentford and then at Nottingham Forest. A generous interpretation of Sunday’s defeat would be to say that the first goal was a shambolic defensive mix-up, the sort of thing that can happen when you try to play out from the back, particularly when players are low on confidence, that the second goal was possibly a brilliant strike or possibly a mis-hit cross, and that the third was an extraordinary drive from 22 yards. Goals like that will not fly in every week. Except … both of Forest duo Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ibrahim Sangaré were given time to measure their shots, and those were far from the only three chances Forest created. Perhaps Spurs have become one of those sides to whom unfortunate things happen – think of the two goals they conceded in the first six minutes against Fulham, which were also the result of a long-range strike and the cheap concession of possession in a dangerous area – but they bear significant responsibility for that. The decline since the opening weeks of the season, when Spurs pushed Paris Saint-Germain to the limit in the Super Cup before losing on penalties and then won away at Manchester City, is striking. The lack of creativity is the obvious problem and it must be acknowledged that Spurs are without the injured Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. But at the same time they bought Xavi Simons, Mohammed Kudus and Mathys Tel at a combined price of £140m ($187m) in the summer, and brought in Randal Kolo Muani on loan; it’s not the barest of bones. Perhaps Frank prioritised sorting out the defence, which probably was the area most in need of improvement after the Ange Postecoglou era. But as results have deteriorated, confidence has waned and that is now affecting the back of the team as well. Or perhaps, coming from Brentford, Frank is less familiar with facing teams who habitually sit in a low block against his side and is struggling to find a way to break them down. At least until Sunday, home form had been the big concern: just two wins in eight league games at the Stadium this season. Nothing is more likely to enrage a fanbase that was already protesting about ticket prices. Frank began slowly at both Brøndby and Brentford, but this is different. The scrutiny at a top Premier League club is of a different magnitude. There have been visible demonstrations of dissatisfaction from players – with the manager from Djed Spence and Micky van de Ven after the defeat to Chelsea, and from Spence on being substituted on Sunday; and with the fans – particularly after the Fulham defeat, when a frustrated Pedro Porro seemed to signal to his teammates not to applaud the stands in response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario. How does this play out? It’s very difficult to tell, given the in September of the chair Daniel Levy as the Lewis family who own the club took a more hands-on role. The summer signings and Frank’s appointment were all Levy’s doing. What the Lewis family and the new directors brought in this year think of those deals is open to question. Already, though, Frank is beginning to come under pressure; it’s just as well the Champions League draw has been relatively gentle, so they lie 11th in that table. The situation not quite irretrievable yet, but there are a lot of worrying signs.",Jonathan Wilson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tournament, which brings in an estimated 80% of Caf’s revenue, has been held every two years since its inception in 1957. Sunday marks the start of the 35th edition, hosted in Morocco with the home team taking on Comoros. The Caf president, Patrice Motsepe, said the next finals, scheduled for 2027 in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, will go ahead and another tournament would be held in 2028, but after that it will be hosted every four years. Motsepe announced the launch of an annual African Nations League from 2029 to fill the gap, following the example of Europe that holds its championship every four years. “Historically the Nations Cup was the prime resource for us but now we will get financial resources every year,” he said. “It is an exciting new structure which will contribute to sustainable financial independence and ensure more synchronisation with the Fifa calendar.” Holding Afcon every four years had been proposed by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, but this had been rebuffed by Caf because of its reliance on the revenues the tournament generates. The timing of Afcon has long courted controversy because it has usually been hosted in the middle of the European season, forcing clubs to release players. This was supposed to be solved by moving it to mid-year from 2019, but the tournaments in Cameroon in 2022 and Côte d’Ivoire in 2024 were again hosted at the start of the year.

But Salah is different, the attraction intensified by the fact that he is the biggest-name player in the Arab world. This is a direction that many in the league want to move towards as it searches for an enduring identity on the global stage. Is the goal to become a rival to the Premier League, or perhaps to try to take second place behind England’s top tier in the marketplace? Or is there a different direction, now the initial wave of excitement and interest has tailed off? China found a decade ago that suddenly signing famous players guarantees short-term headlines but to think about what would come next. Players such as Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba were back in Europe within months. Yet in Saudi Arabia, despite the headlines of impending doom into his Al-Ettifaq stint and Neymar’s injury-hit spell at Al-Hilal, the stars have largely stayed. Benzema, N’Golo Kanté, Sadio Mané, Riyad Mahrez and others are in their third seasons – Ronaldo, the face of it all, is in his fourth. Time is ticking for many of these in terms of contracts, and, well, time. There has been a noticeable move away from signing the veterans, with clubs still shopping in Europe but usually for those in their prime, such as last summer’s signings of Mateo Retegui, Darwin Núñez and Theo Hernández. There have also been many younger additions, such as Nathan Zézé and Enzo Millot. If these can be developed and sold on for profit, so much the better. Being regarded as a decent alternative to Europe for young global talent may not sound especially glamorous or exciting, but it is something no other league has managed. Salah would, however, be a big boost. The SPL is popular in the Arab world but the Liverpool forward’s arrival would take it to a new level. Players such as Mahrez and Yassine Bounou are there and the recent Fifa Arab Cup (the 16-team tournament in Qatar went almost unnoticed internationally but attracted an impressive average attendance of more than 38,000), showed there is plenty of passion and no small amount of talent. There will be at least seven Arab teams – eight if Iraq win their playoff – at the 2026 World Cup. Becoming a go-to league for Africa, which has happened to an extent, and Asia, which hasn’t, is also an obvious step. Signing an Indonesian player, for example, adds millions to social media accounts, and there is always the tantalising prospect of finding the first Indian or Chinese breakout star. That would be welcomed in Riyadh. Maintaining the early international interest was always going to be a challenge but this season has been especially tough. Despite the 2025-26 season kicking off in August, teams have played nine league games, compared with 17 by English teams. The international windows were bigger deals for Saudi Arabia because the national team had playoffs to qualify for the World Cup, which were won, just. Then came a longer stop for the Arab Cup. The league restarts on Thursday, the first action for more than a month. Global broadcasters – the league said it had 37 media rights deals in place for this season, with matches available in more than 180 markets – have become increasingly frustrated, trying to build a loyal audience for a product that comes in fits and bursts, trying to build a narrative for clubs and players that have barely appeared. One told the Guardian that this season was almost a write-off with viewers having so many other options available. League officials in Riyadh are going to have to find a way to ensure that the domestic competition does not play such a clear second fiddle to the national team. Otherwise, becoming a competition of global stature is going to be next to impossible whatever Gianni Infantino says. The Fifa president told Saudi media this week that he believes the league is on track to become one of the top three in the world. Salah would add some immediate sparkle, but his greater value comes in what he could bring to the Arab world in the longer term. This is assuming, of course, , the club want to sell and that he wants to go to Saudi Arabia – all sizeable “ifs”. If it does happen, it will be more important as a capture of a still-glittering Arab legend than of an ageing English Premier League one.",John Duerden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/11/why-do-thousands-buy-tickets-to-watch-lionesses-and-not-turn-up,Why do thousands buy tickets to watch the Lionesses and not turn up?,2025-12-11T11:20:12.000Z,"Crowds at women’s football in England are the envy of the world but there is a curious gap between number of tickets sold and attendances hen the stadium announcer reads out the attendance during England home games, the immediate question that follows relates to the drop-off between the number of tickets sold and the number of fans through the doors. In 2025, on either side of a in Switzerland, the Lionesses played eight home games, including three at Wembley. Across those fixtures, almost 48,000 bought tickets but stayed away. There has been criticism of the empty seats, at Wembley in particular, especially after games announced as sell-outs. Why does this gap exist? Is the criticism fair? What does the Football Association need to do to start ensuring ticket holders turn up? England are, in many respects, victims of their own success. A high bar has been set by attendances since the 2022 Euros. Across the world, the attendances for women’s football in England – at both domestic and international fixtures – are envied. The second-tier WSL2 had one of Europe’s highest cumulative attendances last season. The US women’s national team achieved a peak attendance of 32,303 in 2025, for a friendly against Brazil at the 70,240-capacity SoFi stadium in Los Angeles. That was the only crowd at their 15 home matches to break 30,000 and only three others attracted more than 20,000 spectators. England had a cumulative attendance in 2025 of 302,238 across eight home games, with an average attendance of 37,780 and the final two games brought a combined attendance of more than 94,000 in four days. England have benefited from increased interest in the team in a Euros year but in 2024, with no major tournament, they had an average attendance of 42,770 from seven home games with a peak audience of 78,346 for a that year but across 15 games on US soil their average attendance was 19,269. The lowest attendance was 3,242 against the Dominican Republic in the Concacaf Gold Cup and the highest of 50,644 was achieved in a SheBelieves Cup game against Japan. Attendances in England are not to be dismissed, with work done unceasingly to grow interest since following the 2022 home Euros win. The gap between tickets sold and bums on seats is a problem, but a relatively small one in this context. On 29 November, the gap was the starkest all year, with 74,611 in a sold-out Wembley for England’s friendly against China. Accounting for tickets held for broadcast and operational reasons, a sell-out crowd is approximately 85,000. When you can see large blocks of red seats at a sold-out Wembley, it can be frustrating but for a friendly against a team ranked 16th in the world, the attendance was far beyond what many would have imagined even a year ago, with the national stadium usually reserved for higher-profile games against opponents such as the US, France, Spain and Germany. Had the FA not announced a sellout, which it has to do for operational purposes, there would probably have been little attention paid to those empty seats, but announcing ticket sale progress serves a purpose. As a game edges closer to being sold out it makes fans feel they don’t want to miss out, and if it is a sellout it makes them feel their ticket is valuable. Gaps between tickets sold and attendances are not exclusive to women’s football. For example, the men’s game between England and Wales in October was announced as a sellout but had a 78,116 attendance. There are many potential reasons behind the gap for England women games. Tickets go on sale months in advance to reach high turnouts, often capitalising on major tournaments and fans being on a high after other big fixtures. April’s Nations League fixture against Spain is on sale, with the FA hoping to exploit the festive period by enabling people to buy tickets as gifts. There is no perfect formula and the cost of sales opening months in advance is dropouts. The earlier tickets go on sale the more opportunities there are for people’s plans to change or for Premier League and men’s FA Cup fixtures to move and have an impact. The low price of tickets also plays a part. A family of four could watch England against China for £40 at the lowest price point. However, if the weather isn’t great, there are transport issues, men’s games change and clash or something else comes up, some may feel they can afford to let their low-priced tickets go to waste. Affordability matters though. The cost of living crisis is an important consideration and surely some drop-off is a price worth paying for that level of accessibility to top football? An official resale platform could help address these issues but that would not close the gap fully. In each area the FA is searching for a sweet spot, but these are constantly changing as the game grows and audience tastes and expectations develop. The Guardian understands a cross-functional group in the FA is across this decision-making process, made up of people from the commercial, marketing, communications, digital, ticketing, events, finance and broadcast teams, with technical and team operations staff also involved. The governing body’s relationship with the Football Supporters’ Association is considered a key part of engaging with and understanding the audience for the women’s games. There is very far from a simple fix and it is not an issue being ignored. That the numbers through the gates are at the level they are, though, shows a lot is being done right.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/21/morgan-rogers-aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-football,Morgan Rogers’ golden spell spearheads Aston Villa’s most unlikely title charge,2025-12-21T20:02:33.000Z,"England forward’s brilliance is proving difficult to stop but Unai Emery will surely not be able to keep relying on him every time It is only two months since Morgan Rogers was standing on the Stadium of Light pitch, looking confused as Unai Emery berated him for failing to anticipate a through-ball as Aston Villa that played for an hour with 10 men. At that point, as Villa went six without a win, it wasn’t clear whether Rogers’ form was a symptom or a cause of Villa’s more general malaise. There was a volcanic touchline reaction from Emery on Sunday as well, but this was rather more positive. As Rogers swept in his second of the game to restore Villa’s lead, Emery ripped off his thick padded coat, spread his arms and roared. Villa were on their way to a 10th successive win and, having failed to win any of their first six games of the season, are somehow only three points behind the leaders Arsenal. Are they in the title race? That’s a rather hard question to answer. History, at least in the postwar era, a general sense of the status of the club, suggests not. And they have not been entirely convincing in many games this season, even as the wins have stacked up. In only two games this season have Villa had an xG more than 0.5 greater than their opponents, according to Opta. For a team that have just won 10 in a row, Villa look weirdly vulnerable – but at the moment the margins are falling their way. Their recent policy seems to be to trade blows with an opponent and wait for Rogers to bail them out with a couple of crisp finishes. It happened at Leeds, it , and it happened against Manchester United. Rogers’ first goal stemmed from a brilliant finish, arced just inside the post from the corner of the box, but United couldn’t have done much more to guide him into position. He spent a lot of the game drifting left, haunting the space behind Diogo Dalot. As John McGinn found Rogers, Leny Yoro didn’t exactly charge over to close the 23-year-old down, even though the ball was bouncing awkwardly and required some controlling. The England forward had time to wander back on to his right foot, create the angle for the shot and then deposit the ball into the top corner. When he replaced Jude Bellingham in the England side for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia 12 days before that draw at Sunderland, it felt very much that Rogers was being used to make a point. The thought of him starting at the World Cup next summer seemed distant, not with Phil Foden and Cole Palmer also contending with Bellingham for the role behind Harry Kane. But on this form, it’s hard to see how Rogers could be left out. At the moment, Rogers is in one of those golden spells of form in which it seems that he cannot miss. If the ball falls within the arc of his right foot, it will end up in the net. His second goal was essentially a slight scruffier version of his first as he seized on an Ollie Watkins lay-off, took advantage of further dilatory defending from Yoro and clipped his shot past Senne Lammens. Forewarned, you might have thought was forearmed, but perhaps Rogers’ right foot is becoming like Arjen Robben’s left: just because you know he’s going to whip the ball into the top corner doesn’t mean you can stop him. Or perhaps this was just a game against , a club whose journey through the wilderness shows no sign of reaching a destination any time soon. They weren’t terrible, but they had nobody with the decisiveness of Rogers, while the tendency towards self-destruction remains strong. Can Villa sustain this? Logic says not. United had more shots and more shots on target than Villa. They’ve won each of their last eight games by a single goal. They’ve conceded in all but one of those games. Regression to the mean might be the biggest rival Villa have to face over the coming weeks. Rogers, surely, cannot keep on thrashing the ball into the top corner. Perhaps there is another reality in which, rather than results trending towards performances, performances begin to trend towards results. Maybe Watkins rediscovers his best form and starts scoring again. Maybe Jadon Sancho turns into the player he looked at Borussia Dortmund. Maybe Harvey Elliott rediscovers his form. Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres will eventually return from injury. Perhaps there is in that the possibility of a title challenge, but they surely cannot keep relying on Rogers. But then nobody expected this. Nobody thought Villa would be third at Christmas. And certainly two months ago, nobody thought Rogers by the end of the year would be spearheading a title charge while looking like a vital England player. The current run is to be savoured precisely because it feels so unlikely. As Rogers stood in front of the North End at the final whistle conducting the cheers of the crowd, he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. As he deserves to. These spells are rare in football and should be relished.",Jonathan Wilson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/21/i-made-such-a-bond-jesse-lingard-on-life-in-south-korea-and-his-next-challenge,‘I made such a bond’: Jesse Lingard on life in South Korea and his next challenge,2025-12-21T08:00:54.000Z,"Former Manchester United player discusses culinary and cultural surprises, feeling more mature and how he learned Korean esse Lingard says his Korean is decent, good enough to make himself understood when out for dinner and the shocks do not stop there. The former Manchester United and England midfielder was always going to throw himself into his K League adventure with FC Seoul and now that it is over after two years, a new chapter beckoning when the January transfer window opens, the 33-year-old certainly has the tales to tell. It was the little things as much as anything else, the cultural quirks. And the bigger ones, of course – such as the time he watched an octopus squirm in front of him before eating it. “The food is different, obviously, and I tried live octopus,” Lingard says. “It was moving. I was scared at first but it was all right.” Lingard loved how the people of Seoul would react to him on the street. “It’s always like: ‘Oh!’” he says, mimicking a sharp intake of breath, putting his hand over his mouth and opening his eyes as wide as possible. “They get very shocked. Then they go: ‘Lingard, Lingard.’ And come over for a photo.” It was not always so innocent when it came to the Seoul fans, Lingard remembering the run of five straight home defeats last season and a number of losses this time out that should not have happened. “They would wait outside the stadium and block the bus in for an hour – and make the coach go and speak to them,” he says. “It was crazy. It’s because Seoul is the biggest club in the country. I always compare it to United. The expectation to win is always there.” Lingard is back in his hometown of Warrington, looking forward to Christmas with family and beyond that to his next challenge. He describes himself as “open” as to where it may be. “Europe, Saudi, UAE …” he says. Lingard’s next club will get a player who retains ferocious drive and stamina. In his final four games for Seoul, the last against Melbourne City in the Asian Champions League on 10 December, he ran between 11.4km and 12.4km. He covered between 9% and 10% of those distances at a very high intensity, an elite-level statistic. Lingard has also been changed by Seoul. “I feel that I’m more mature now, more responsible,” he says. A part of that was down to how he grew after being given the captain’s armband midway through his first season. He helped the younger players, in particular, to come out of their shells and communicate better on the pitch. The other reason was the move itself, the boldness of it and how he came to own it. Lingard was at a low ebb at the end of the 2022-23 season with Nottingham Forest, where he had gone on a one-year deal after the expiry of his contract at United. He barely played for Forest over the second half of it, fitness problems a contributing factor, and he could not find a club he wanted to join during the summer transfer window. In effect, Lingard took six months out, biding his time until the European mid-season window, keeping himself ticking over by training with his personal coach. It would also be a time of heartbreak, Lingard’s grandmother dying in November 2023. “It was really hard because I was so close to her,” he says. “I was always at her house when I was younger. But I thought it was God saying: ‘Just be with her, be with your family. And wait until January.’ That was when Seoul came in.” Lingard signed a two-year deal on 8 February 2024; the K League season runs from the start of March to the end of November. Never before had Korea welcomed such a high-profile foreign player and only six Englishmen had played there: Dalian Atkinson, Jamie Cureton, Andy Cooke, Chris Marsden, Richard Offiong and Jordon Mutch. “I was shocked at first because I didn’t know anything about Seoul,” Lingard says. “But when I started to think about it, I thought it could be a chance to reset, to get away from the noise in Manchester. There’s a lot of distractions [in Manchester]. You can get roped into going out and stuff like that. I just wanted to get away and really knuckle down on the football part.” Lingard endured a false start in the Land of the Morning Calm. He was a substitute in Seoul’s opening three games, then needed surgery on the meniscus in a knee and was out for two months. A crowd of 51,670 had turned up for his home debut against Incheon United at the Seoul World Cup stadium, which has a capacity of 66,704. The club’s average K League attendance during his time with them was about 25,000. Still first choice for England and Everton Mainstay at Burnley after leaving Manchester City A Thomas Tuchel favourite but in and out at City On a Manchester United rollercoaster since 2019 At Brentford, via Saudi Arabia and Ajax Almost always a Newcastle first choice when fit Without a club after Como released him in September Looking for his next club after leaving Seoul Making irregular appearances for Ipswich at 40 Frozen out at Chelsea, he last played in May Scoring for fun at Bayern, he remains England captain On loan at Barcelona from Manchester United Retired in July 2024, having not played since late 2021 Joined Monaco last summer after spell with Bayern Cremonese striker – November's Serie A player of the month It was possible to worry about how Lingard would settle, mainly because of his previous , which affected him in 2019 and the early months of 2020. Was a move so far from home really wise? That, however, is in the past and when he recovered his physical fitness, he began to make his mark. Lingard found a penthouse apartment with views over the Han River; one of the others in the building belongs to the South Korea captain, Son Heung-min. “I didn’t see him around the place because he was away playing [with Tottenham then Los Angeles FC], although he did come to the training ground a few times, so I met him there,” Lingard says. “My best friend is called Sunny and he came to live with me. He was back and forth for the majority of the first year.” Lingard finished the 2024 season with six goals and three assists from 26 appearances as Seoul came fourth in the 12-team league to qualify for the Asian Champions League. This time out, he had 10 goals and four assists from 34 league appearances as the club finished sixth. He also had three goals and three assists in six Asian Champions League games. Seoul, a sleeping giant fighting to regain prominence, are fifth in the 12-team East Region group with two matches to play. The top eight advance to the last 16. There is no doubt Lingard was taken aback by the facilities at Seoul, although he never complained. The training ground does not have a canteen, meaning the players have to go out for their own lunch. There are no seats in the changing room and the lack of under-soil heating at the training ground and stadium is a problem. “If it’s snowing or icy, you can’t train,” Lingard says. “You just have to do gym or run on the Astroturf. We had to do that in the last few weeks of the season because of the cold. We also had a game at the stadium last year where it was freezing and the whole of the left side of the pitch was like ice. We had to play most of the football on the right-hand side.” It was the people who helped to make it for Lingard. There was his translator, Ki Ji-yong, known as Daniel, who took him to training every day. “A great guy, we got on straight away,” Lingard says. And there were the many friends he made in the dressing room. “Most of the players could speak good English,” he says. “The manager, Kim Gi-dong, spoke to me through a translator, although in the second year he got a few English words. But d’you know what? My Korean was good. I learned off a young player called Ham Sun-woo. When I joined up for my first pre-season, he’d come to my room. He couldn’t speak English but he was there, trying my hats on, looking at my watch. He had a good energy, a good vibe about him and we just clicked. “At first, we’d speak through the translator but he’d pick up little words that I would say and I’d pick up his words in Korean. That’s how I learned – just through him. And he learned English through me. Eventually we’d be able to go for dinner by ourselves because we could communicate with each other. “I’ve got a few stories from dinners out and I remember one from when I first got there and I went to eat with a couple of the young players. Their culture is that they always wait for the oldest person at the table to start eating first. So, my food didn’t come and theirs was there and they’re not eating. I was telling them: ‘Eat. Mine is coming.’ And they were like: ‘No, we can’t.’ I could literally leave my food, not touch it and they wouldn’t be able to touch theirs. That was a shock to me.” In the end, it was emotional. There was a one-year option in Lingard’s contract, which he did not take up, and, days before the Melbourne game, Seoul announced it would be his last dance. Lingard scored in a 1-1 draw, celebrating with a moonwalk, and fought back tears after when he watched a video on the big screen that paid tribute to “Our beloved captain”. It went on to say that Seoul would always be his home, his name forever remembered by the club. “I cried when I left United,” Lingard says. “And I made such a bond over these last two years with the players and fans that it was always going to be emotional again. I think I’ve left a strong legacy.”",David Hytner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/23/zvonimir-boban-if-i-didnt-do-this-it-would-be-a-betrayal-of-every-value-i-have-lived-for,Zvonimir Boban: ‘If I didn’t do this it would be a betrayal of every value I have lived for’,2025-12-23T08:00:51.000Z,"The Croatia legend on his return to Dinamo Zagreb, his fall out with Uefa and the ‘shameful’ actions of Gianni Infantino n afternoon mist is descending over Stadion Maksimir, enhancing the severity of its dramatic, precipitous angles. In a building across the way, Zvonimir Boban is explaining what brought him back. We are eating squid ink risotto in one corner of a room now configured as Dinamo Zagreb’s canteen; diagonally opposite is the spot where, fighting through the club’s youth system, a young arrival from Dalmatia used to sleep. “Emotionally it’s the biggest story of my life, this one,” Boban says, memories of this former dormitory leaping into his mind’s eye. “Where, if not here?” He has, in some shape or form, been almost everywhere else. Boban has burned brightly but briefly in each of his various lives as a football administrator. The sport would look different were it not for his influence in senior roles at Fifa and Uefa across the past decade. Almost two years have passed since his high-profile resignation from the latter and there was always the sense Boban, opinionated and deeply principled, had further rungs to climb. Instead his world has, in contrasting ways, both shrunk and grown. The policymaking clout he held in Zurich and Nyon is no more; neither of those posts, though, came with the persistent public gaze and criticism that are part of the package as Dinamo president. The day’s newspapers pay testament to that with some scathing commentaries after a 3-1 Europa League defeat by Real Betis here the previous evening. “They say Jesus was a good man,” he says. “Better than any of us, that’s clear, no? They crucified him, so who are we not to be crucified in our everyday life?” The sentence is typical Boban: a rhetorical force who swept back in six months ago, initially as CEO before becoming president via Dinamo’s first fully democratic election in September, to reshape the club he captained at 19 before leaving for Milan 34 years ago. The plan is to galvanise an institution still tarred and scarred by the scandal-hit reign of the former chief executive Zdravko Mamic. He is undertaking the challenge without receiving a salary. “All my life I was proclaiming love for Dinamo, for these people, for this city, for my country,” he says. “Then, at the moment when they are giving you the opportunity, will you say: ‘No, I’m 57, actually I’ll sit and rest on an island watching the sea and fishing’? If I didn’t do this it would be a betrayal of every value I have lived for.” During three hours spent around Maksimir he will outline his vision but there are elephants to clear from the room, too. The most obvious is , where he had been chief of football for almost three years, in January 2024. Boban felt Aleksander Ceferin had been out of line in proposing statute changes, subsequently passed, that would allow Ceferin to run for a fourth term of presidency. At the time he criticised Ceferin’s “personal aspirations”; in response, Ceferin told the Guardian that Boban “does not deserve my comment”. Boban, winner of four Serie A titles and the 1994 Champions League with Milan, had been an influential, if sometimes frustrated, ex-player’s voice among the bureaucrats. So, any regrets? “I’m just sorry for the personal relationship with Aleksander, I’m sorry that this is what happened.” They have not spoken since. “We had a very nice relationship in these few years, and with the family as well. But I did what I had to do and I explained it very well. He chose his way, that’s it, and I wish him only the best. “But I’m not regretting anything, not at all. I thought for two months before doing that. I didn’t react like a kid, like a spoiled child. I thought a lot. I took my time and left time for others to think as well. Everyone will live with their own decisions and their own consequences: myself, and others as well.” He believes he would still be at Uefa had that rift not opened up. But it would have felt inauthentic to bottle up his grievances, just as it would when in March 2020, nine months into a spell as Milan’s chief football officer, he criticised their ownership in an interview that effectively forced his dismissal. It begs the question of how he would have reacted if still in situ at Fifa, where he was deputy secretary general between 2016 and 2019 before joining Milan. Boban operated alongside Gianni Infantino to transform what, during that tenure, he said had previously been a “scared and lost organisation”. He stands firmly by their body of work, launching into a sprawling defence of the video assistant refereeing project to which he was fundamental. Lots of analysis, he thinks, neglects to point out the role VAR has in making it harder to corrupt the outcome of a game. “The integrity and transparency of football are now completely different,” he says. A rapid-fire recital of figures and statistics follows, contrasting the time lost through VAR interventions with the seven and a half minutes per game occupied by throw-ins. Surely he would have walked, back then, in the event Infantino had pulled any of the stunts that have defined recent years at Fifa. Boban pulls few punches when addressing with which Infantino hijacked the 2026 World Cup finals draw. “Disrespectful and irresponsible,” he says of his former boss’s actions. “I couldn’t watch it. I was surprised he started to think in this way, too political, obsessed with the politicians and all those stories. “At the beginning it wasn’t like this. Everything was about football and footballers. We had to bring Fifa back in that direction and were doing it. Later, it has started to go in a different way. Gianni has always been accountable and very responsible, but he isn’t aware of what he is doing to himself and Fifa now. Thinking to do the best, but doing completely the opposite. It shouldn’t be a political organisation but now you’re doing this, it’s shameful. “None of this can deny all the good things he’s done, and not because I was there. But on the other hand it shows that the way is lost. At least that’s how everything has been presented with this ridiculous piece of work. And I’m sorry for that. Sorry for Fifa, sorry for him, sorry for football.” We have gone back over to Boban’s office and in walks Albert Capellas, appointed by him to head up Dinamo’s academy in June, for a brief introduction. Capellas spent more than a decade working with Barcelona’s youth and B sides. Boban’s plan is to blend a La Masia-style methodology with the heart that has helped launch scores of Croatian footballers to greatness. “We would like to have one of the best football schools in Europe and I believe that, in a few years’ time, we will have it,” Boban says. “So that everyone knows that, if they are thinking about taking a player from Dinamo, it is an educated player.” He thinks Dinamo can become a credible stop for youngsters from bigger leagues who need to refine their competitive edge. The 20-year-old Sergi Domínguez – “one of the best young defenders in the world, if not the best” – arrived from Barcelona during pre-season in a notable yield from the relationship. Dani Olmo once beat a similar path. Cardoso Varela, a former Porto winger who has just turned 17, is widely expected to swap Zagreb for the Camp Nou next. Boban’s conviction is hypnotic. But can such methods be enough to make teams such as Dinamo competitive in a sport whose elite are unmoored and disappearing over the horizon? “I believe in time we can do it,” he says, citing Atalanta as the model of a club driven by smart decisions. He will not broach criticism of the swollen new European competition formats, which he believes Uefa has executed well. Many inside the corridors of power would acknowledge it was Boban, in one of his most persistent set-tos with the executive committee, who talked the new Champions League down from a 10-game group format to its current eight. Similarly, Boban was one of the Club World Cup’s chief proponents while at Fifa but had pushed for a tournament limited to 24 entrants played over 18 days, with three-team groups and knockout games going straight to penalties if drawn. He embarks upon a long denunciation of its present form. “Thirty-two teams and 30 days, you are killing the players,” he says. Boban warms to his themes, among them what he sees as “another killer element” in the form of extra time, while puffing on a cigar. It is impossible not to fear he has been lost too soon to those guiding the game’s direction. Ceferin may well run unopposed for his next Uefa term in 2027 and, even in a largely sewn-up political climate, Boban would have backers. Wouldn’t he be tempted to give it a crack? “No, no. I know, I know. There are people, a lot of them, they call me often. But this was the first real station of my football life and it will be the last. And it’s the one I love most, respect most. It’s an emotion that I can’t bring anywhere else. So what else can there be? What more?” By now the Maksimir pitch is obscured by fog. Somewhere out there, in May 1990, Boban became a national hero when he launched a flying kick at a policeman as violence erupted during a match between Dinamo and Red Star Belgrade. Contrary to some interpretations it did not, by a long chalk, spark the bloody Yugoslav wars but overnight he became a towering icon of Croatian resistance. Croatia declared independence the following year. “It was a collective moment, not mine. A collective moment of the Croatian youth who had never felt so much injustice and were rallying towards a Croatian cause. We were rebels, a resistance, but the real heroes are the guys who fought in the war for our freedom. It is much, much bigger than me. “I was proud of us that day, proud of the young people and how we reacted. What were we looking for? Freedom. We did the right thing. It was nothing about nationalism, nothing about hatred between Croatia and Serbia, simply justice and freedom.” Long before Fifa called Boban had completed a history degree, become a journalist, developed business interests. “Maybe the events at the time in former Yugoslavia pushed me towards studying,” he says. What did he learn? “That people don’t change a lot. What’s changing is our surroundings, the forms and materials. Ancient Greeks lived the same doubts, problems and fears as we do today.” And nothing could ever change Boban. “You can read a million books or get a million diplomas but I’m a football player in my soul,” he says.Sometimes he grabs a pair of boots and travels to the academy pitches with Capellas. There is not much cartilage in the knees but he will join in with the under-14s or under-15s; an attempt to live with the under-17s proved a step too far. “What they see now can’t inspire them too much,” he says. “I never defend, always the joker. But since I was four or five, I thought if I had one mission in this world it was to play football. And with the best part of my heart, I’m still that kid.”",Nick Ames,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Howe is “99.9%” certain he will no longer be Newcastle’s manager by the time any training ground or stadium project is completed, he believes the release of a blueprint could prove “gamechanging”. “You look at the training ground, the stadium, and that part of the club is in limbo at the moment,” said Newcastle’s manager, aware the on whether to redevelop St James’ Park or opt for a new-build and has not identified a preferred site for a long-promised training complex capable of housing the men’s, women’s and academy teams. “It would be a big step forward to get clarity. “It would take everything into the future in a really positive way; it would also have a gamechanging effect on everything, including the academy.” Howe, whose 11th-placed team travel to Manchester United on Boxing Day, suggested Newcastle’s academy was being let down by arguably less than stellar facilities. “Brilliant work goes on down there,” he said. “If we can move everything forward in terms of facilities that would be a gamechanger. It’s not that I believe facilities are the be-all and end-all but they are a great way of setting standards higher and showing your ambition in a clear and strong way.” If Howe struggled to hide his frustration about the lack of final decisions on training ground and stadium projects that could respectively take five and 10 years to complete, he also recognised the need for thoroughness. “The decisions have to be right,” he said. “If extra time is needed to make the right decisions, then take it. You need the right site and designs. I would rather it was correct than rushed. “I know there’s a 99.9% chance that I’m not going to see either completed in my [present] position but I’m still passionate about making sure they’re there for future generations of Newcastle supporters and players.” Regardless of how long he remains in charge, Howe has left a legacy after choreographing last spring’s Carabao Cup triumph. “The last 12 months have been unbelievable for us because we finally won a trophy, and when I came here that was the big aim,” he said. “And it’s a great experience to be in the Champions League again.” Howe admitted, though, that he sometimes struggles for instant job satisfaction. “The word ‘enjoy’ is one I battle with, because, when I go home every day, very rarely will I go: ‘I really enjoyed that,’” he said. “It’s a difficult one because I love coaching. I love being on the grass with the players. “But there’s a lot of the job that sort of gets in the way of that. So while I must ultimately love it and enjoy it, that’s on a more probably subconscious level. A lot of the day-to-day emotions are stress and anxiety.” Nonetheless, Howe agreed 2025 has been the best year of his managerial career. “It has to be. And I have to remind myself of that sometimes. When you feel a bit battered and bruised as you do as a football manager at times, you sometimes have to take a step back and see things for what they are and not what people tell you they are. “It’s been a great year, 2025, and one that in the future I will look back on and really appreciate even more than I do right now. But the challenge never stops and you want to make 2026 even better and that is the tricky part. “",Louise Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/26/middlesbrough-blackburn-championship-match-report,Cautious Middlesbrough lose ground on leaders with goalless Blackburn draw,2025-12-26T17:24:25.000Z,"Kim Hellberg’s determination to succeed as manager runs deep. So deep that he decided it would be best if his wife and two small children spent Christmas in their native Sweden while he continued to put in long days on Teesside. Given that the Hellberg family will soon be reunited in a new home in North Yorkshire and Blackburn’s visit represented the first of four games in nine days it seemed a sensible sacrifice – even if such pragmatism failed to pay the desired Boxing Day dividends. The former Hammarby head coach had hoped to celebrate the completion of his first month in charge at the Riverside Stadium after succeeding the Wolves-bound Rob Edwards with three points but Blackburn, and their irrepressible midfielder Todd Cantwell in particular, had different ideas. While this draw keeps Boro second in the , eight points behind the leaders Coventry, it raised question marks about the long-term suitability of Hellberg’s narrow 4-2- 2-2 formation. Before last weekend’s 2-0 defeat at Bristol City, the 37-year-old had presided over four straight wins and Boro appeared to be turning into wingless wonders. Here though his preferred configuration looked overly compact and a system built on plenty of slick, short, sharp one and two-touch passing through midfield malfunctioned a little. Admittedly the resultant congestion probably helped limit Cantwell’s room for manoeuvre behind Blackburn’s front two but he remained influential enough to make longstanding home fans pine for a Stuart Ripley or a Stewart Downing offering an outlet down the wings. Boro’s own attacks were invariably constructed in central areas and, although players naturally drifted wide at times the resultant lack of crosses often made life relatively straightforward for Valérien Ismaël’s back five. Hellberg preferred to blame the execution of his gameplan rather than the blueprint itself. “I think we passed the ball too much instead of driving forward,” said Edwards’s impressive, eloquent replacement. “The performance was not good enough. We didn’t deserve more than a draw. But that’s life, you have days that are tough.” Ismaël’s post-match delight certainly seemed a testament to Boro’s potential. “It was tough, as we expected, but we played a great away game,” said Blackburn’s manager. “Middlesbrough might be the best side we’ve faced so far this season in possession but we managed that well. I’m very proud of the boys. We just needed to be more clinical in the final third.” Indeed, Ismaël’s side would have taken a late first-half counterattacking lead had Yuki Ohashi not dragged his shot wide at a moment when Hellberg’s defence had come completely undone. Suitably stung, the hosts were very nearly ahead themselves a couple of minutes later after David Strelec and Hayden Hackney conjured a fine break that concluded with Morgan Whittaker watching in disbelief as his right-footed shot rebounded off the inside of a post. Hellberg liberated Sverre Nypan’s midfield skills from the bench at the outset of the second half but the 19-year-old Manchester City loanee and Norway international was eclipsed by Cantwell’s increasing vision and determination. The former Norwich and Rangers creator has recently recovered from injury and wore an enormous bandage on his already heavily strapped right knee but he refused to allow it to weigh him down. Cantwell’s cause was helped by the introduction of Moussa Baradji in the heart of the Rovers midfield. On for the injured Ryoya Morishita, the Frenchman delighted in reducing Hackney’s control in the centre of the pitch. Tellingly, a clearly frustrated Hackney seemed fortunate to be shown a yellow rather than a red card after kicking out aggressively at Taylor Gardner-Hickman with the ball long gone. Granted Blackburn did not force Middlesbrough’s goalkeeper Sol Brynn into a single significant save, let alone take advantage of the injury-induced withdrawal of three home defenders in Alfie Jones, George Edmundson and the Newcastle loanee Matt Targett. But the way they stifled Boro’s creativity bodes well for Ismaël’s future. On this evidence his improving Rovers should soon allay any lingering fears of a springtime relegation skirmish but Middlesbrough may arguably need to adopt a slightly less one-dimensional approach when Hull visit Teesside on Monday night.",Louise Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action,Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,2025-12-22T08:00:24.000Z,"Highs and lows for Alexander Isak, Wolves’ sobering survival chances and were Chelsea lucky at Newcastle? Can results be misleading? That is the question. Aston Villa’s winning streak continued against Manchester United, but so did the nagging doubts. They were the lesser team by several measures – fewer shots (12-15), less possession (43-57), fewer big chances (2-3). As usual, the victory was a slender one. But games are not won by stats. They are won by solid teamwork, shrewd management and individual talent – and Villa have all three. Morgan Rogers may be their only star, but he’s delivering like Father Christmas. Unai Emery is wily, battle-hardened, five years ahead of Ruben Amorim. If Rogers profited from Leny Yoro’s naivety, that was probably because Emery had spotted that Yoro is not a right-back, and told Rogers to start wide, cut in and torment him. Talent and management, working together. When Manchester United beat Brighton 4-2 on 25 October, their fans began to believe again. They had won three league games in a row for the first time under Ruben Amorim. They had risen to fourth. And the wins were all good ones – over Brighton (one of their many bogey teams), Liverpool (away!) and Sunderland (at home, against a promoted club, but still – a comfortable clean sheet). Senne Lammens was reassuring, Bryan Mbeumo was exciting and was looking forward to a haircut. But then United went back to black. Eight games, two wins, six missed opportunities. At Villa Park they were the better team without ever looking like winning. Yes, Matheus Cunha scored a good goal, but he also missed a sitter. Yes, United were unlucky with injuries (to Kobbie Mainoo, then Bruno Fernandes), but they conceded soft goals. After 13 months in England, Amorim still hasn’t worked out how to win. It was an 8pm kick-off on the Saturday before Christmas but a distinct lack of quality in the final third made for . For Everton, the issue came as no surprise with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye absent, and Jack Grealish unable to spark an entire team on his own. In many respects it is remarkable that David Moyes’s side sat fifth in the table two weeks earlier given they have played the entire season without a decent striker. For Arsenal and Mikel Arteta, while he savoured a deserved win and a return to the top of the table, the flaw should be equally concerning given their designs on the Premier League title. Arteta insisted that winning margins will inevitably become bigger with hard work and perseverance. But it is a little early in the season for a team that can start with Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard, while leaving Eberechi Eze, Ethan Nwaneri and Noni Madueke on the bench, to be relying on grinding out wins. On Christmas Day Pep Guardiola will monitor the scales to ensure his Manchester City players have not overdone the festive fare. After Saturday’s win against West Ham, he said: “Tomorrow training – the players asked to take a day off and I said: ‘No, because you didn’t play good enough.’ So recovery, train the guys that didn’t play, and after three days off, then two days to prepare for Nottingham Forest. Yesterday they were weighed and every player made their best weight. They come back on the 25th and I will be [monitoring] how many kilos come up – if they come [back] fatty. Imagine one player arrives with three kilos more. He will [stay] in Manchester, not travel to Nottingham.” Guardiola clarified how the side can improve. “I’m good at reading what happens in the game, where are the spaces – if the players were in these positions, we could create more.” Guardiola will also enjoy a rest: “I have holidays with the family and champagne. Sunday I’m going to Barcelona – I recommend it, the food is top.” Alexander Isak’s goal at Tottenham felt, for a glorious few seconds, . This was exactly what Liverpool paid all that money for him to do, to break tight games with his movement and range of finishing, and the confidence with which he clipped in from Florian Wirtz’s neat pass boded superbly. So the sight of him departing immediately, the victim of a rash Micky van de Ven attempt to retain parity, was a huge concern for Arne Slot and a shame for any neutral who would like to see an extraordinary talent hit full tilt again. and he likely faces a lengthy period on the sidelines. It would be a major blow with Slot’s team having snuck up on the top four, putting together a six-game unbeaten run bookended by Isak’s first Premier League goals in their colours. Their fortunes this season appear tied up with those of their £125m investment. Managers often moan about contentious refereeing decisions as a means of deflecting media attention from matters they would prefer were not talked about. The 13 points Newcastle have dropped from winning positions this season seems a case in point. Eddie Howe certainly did not seem overly keen to mention that unfortunate habit following his side’s in a game they ended up drawing. Yet Newcastle’s manager was surely justified in criticising a decision made by the referee, Andy Madley, and endorsed by VAR not to award his team a penalty following Trevoh Chalobah’s blatant body check on Anthony Gordon. With the score then 2-1, a spot-kick could have changed the narrative. Was the decision to offer the Chelsea defender the benefit of considerable doubt informed by Gordon’s reputation for being very clever at winning penalties and sometimes going down too easily? The former England striker Peter Crouch was on analysis duty for TNT Sports and his take was interesting. “Gordon’s waiting,” said Crouch. “He knows the challenge is coming and he’s waiting for it. I think he’s ready to go down. But the force and aggression there … that’s not shielding the ball.” spelled relief for Keith Andrews. Rather than celebrate, Andrews sympathised with Wolves, the club he joined at 16. “I spent nine years here, 20% of my life,” he said. Wolves’ situation is beyond dire; Opta state – perhaps generously – their chances of relegation at 99.17%, leaving nothing to play for beyond pride. Andrews’ fellow Irishman Matt Doherty brutally spelled out the legacy that awaits Wolves players: “Do we want to be remembered for fighting all the way to the end of season, or do we want to be remembered for being cowards and taking the easy option, maybe trying to leave in January or not fighting and training, and letting other people take your position?” Jørgen Strand Larsen’s poor late penalty added insult to injury, the Norwegian already in fans’ bad books for wishing to leave in the summer. Any bond between supporters and players is close to as broken as that with the owners. Oliver Glasner was unable to find almost any positives on Saturday night, but the club as a whole will have taken pleasure in the academy graduate Joél Drakes-Thomas coming off the bench in the 85th minute to become Crystal Palace’s youngest-ever Premier League player at 16 years and 194 days, surpassing David Ozoh (17 years and 260 days). Drakes-Thomas is so young he required a sponsorless shirt because under-18s can’t promote betting companies. The No 10 played 90 minutes on Thursday in the Conference League and did not look out of place, taking advantage of Palace’s hectic schedule to show he is ready for the challenge of first-team football. Drakes-Thomas’s promotion is also an indication of the lack of senior depth within the Palace squad caused by poor recruitment last summer, injuries and Ismaïla Sarr’s Afcon departure, leaving Glasner frustrated and looking to January to help improve the situation. As Fabian Hürzeler pointed out after , Brighton are going through a “phase” of not being able to score goals that has meant they have only picked up two points from their last four matches. The continued absence of Danny Welbeck due to a persistent back injury has certainly not helped, but Georginio Rutter has struggled since being pressed into a more advanced role, having scored only once so far this season. After the sale of João Pedro to Chelsea in the summer, Brighton spent big on Charalampos Kostoulas and the Greek teenager looked lively when he came on for the last 19 minutes against Sunderland. Kostoulas is still waiting for his first Premier League start, but with Kaoru Mitoma back from injury to provide the chances, could the trip to face the leaders, Arsenal, on Saturday be the 18-year-old’s moment to show what he is capable of? There is a sense that Bournemouth are underachieving this season. Only Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool have scored more goals than Andoni Iraola’s side so far this season, so why has this not translated into points? While 26 goals is a decent tally, they have been spread across 12 of Bournemouth’s 17 games; that’s five blanks, and in six of the nine games where they have scored two more goals only three have resulted in wins. To some degree that is misfortune, but if you’re scoring in clusters then you need defensive resolve to earn you points because there will be days – such as Saturday’s – when Evanilson and David Brooks waste chances. There is no harsher reminder of the difficulty of competing in the Premier League than conceding to Burnley’s only shot on target.",Guardian sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/22/wolves-premier-league-freefall-derby-county-record,Wolves’ freefall leaves even Derby’s dismal record low a lofty goal,2025-12-22T16:53:33.000Z,"A side that once looked resilient has collapsed into historic futility, with Wolves now facing the grim task of avoiding the worst season English league football has ever seen aturday’s defeat at home to Brentford means Wolves have taken just two points for 17 games. No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for a season set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement. How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a 10th of that? The drop-off is extraordinary. There were departures in the summer, with Matheus Cunha joining Manchester United, Rayan Aït-Nouri going to Manchester City, Fábio Silva sold to Borussia Dortmund, Gonçalo Guedes gone to Real Sociedad and Pablo Sarabia and Nelson Semedo – 115 league starts between them last season – leaving on frees. But that in itself shouldn’t have been enough to send Wolves into freefall. Last summer, though, was not a one-off. Wolves have been selling off talent and not really replacing it for a couple of years now. Pedro Neto, Maximilian Kilman and Mario Lemina left the previous season. Matheus Nunes, Rúben Neves and Nathan Collins went the season before that. A team can endure a certain level of downgrade for a while, but there comes a point at which a critical mass is reached. It’s less to do with the quality of the squad per se, although that clearly plays a role, than with the perception of decline. Matt Doherty, seeming distraught after Saturday’s game, made the point that it was time for players to decide whether history would regard them as cowards. The implication was clear. At least some of his team-mates are considering a January exit. Others perhaps have just mentally given up. Far easier to accept what now appears an inevitable relegation if a player can tell himself he wasn’t really trying by the end and neither was anybody else. It’s a way of deflecting blame: how could we perform in that environment? Doherty doesn’t have to be wrong for those players to have a point. Wolves has become an impossible place to play. It never starts out too badly. They caused Manchester City some problems on the opening day before losing 4-0. They lost the following three league games by a single goal. A 3-1 home defeat to Leeds perhaps began to raise serious concerns, but Wolves followed that up by beating Everton in the League Cup and then drawing against Tottenham and Brighton in the league. With two of the promoted clubs in the following two games there seemed a realistic possibility they could drag themselves towards respectability. But they were physically overwhelmed at Sunderland, losing 2-0, and then let in a 95th-minute winner after coming from 2-0 down to level against Burnley. And with that, Wolves’ season fell apart. They’ve scored just twice in eight league games since. No side has really outplayed them, but the fight has left them, something embodied by Jørgen Strand Larsen’s limp penalty miss on Saturday. After Pereira left, Rob Edwards came in, having walked out on a Middlesbrough side who looked well-placed for promotion from the Championship. Although he had done something similar in leaving Forest Green to take over at Watford earlier in his career, this move seemed motivated by a desire to try to save Wolves, the club he supports and for whom he played 100 league games. He may have been born on Christmas Day, but so far it seems unlikely he will enact a miracle. Having taken Luton down, his reputation may never recover. The chairman, Jeff Shi, unexpectedly stood down on Saturday after almost a decade in the role, although he remans as chairman and CEO of Fosun Sports Group, which owns Wolves. His reasons for quitting are unclear, although there had been consistent fan protests against his reign. He has been replaced, pending a full-time appointment, by Nathan Shi, who is no relation. Whoever comes in will face a fanbase furious with how the club has been run over the past three years. Perhaps Wolves thought that even after weakening their squad with sales they would still be good enough to finish above the three promoted sides. Certainly the struggles of the three teams coming up helped them over the previous two seasons. But with Sunderland and Leeds both starting the season well, Wolves have been cast adrift. They are 16 points from safety. Survival already seems a forlorn hope. All that remains is to try to surpass Derby’s record low. This article was amended on 23 December 2025.

Through it all, the hot tip for Sports Personality of the Year has kept a cool head t the end of last year, Chloe Kelly was seriously considering stepping away from football. She was deeply unhappy at Manchester City, her team since 2020, where it seemed as if they wouldn’t let her play, nor let her leave. She wasn’t getting enough time on the pitch, so wasn’t sure that she would be selected for England, who were preparing to defend the title she had helped win in . She was 26, about to turn 27. She had been a professional footballer since she was 18, but her mother was starting to get concerned. She desperately wanted her daughter to be happy again. “I remember my mum coming up to see me and she was meant to go home, but she didn’t go home, because she was so worried,” recalls Kelly. Less than a year later, and things are very different. At the time of writing, Kelly is favourite to win Sports Personality of the Year after a history-making comeback. At the end of January, she was loaned to Arsenal and in , very much the underdogs in the final against Barcelona, whom they defeated 1-0. At the end of July, she scored penalty for England, securing them a second Euros title, against arch-rivals Spain. She was fifth in the Ballon D’or Féminin, and named in the – a peer-voted list of the best footballers in the world. Against the odds, then, 2025 has turned out to be a great year. “For sure,” Kelly smiles. “To bounce back, that’s what makes it the best year of my career.” Trying to pin down Kelly is not the easiest of tasks. The football calendar is notoriously overstuffed, to the point of controversy. We finally speak the day after , a much-needed victory in a turbulent season for the team so far. It is only midmorning, but she and her husband, Scott Moore, drove up to Manchester from London first thing, so that Kelly could see a chiropractor. The appointment was at 7.30am. “I’ve had a little niggle in my back,” she explains. The next women’s World Cup is not until 2027, so there’s plenty of time, but, is it anything we need to be worried about? “No, no, no!” she says, quickly. “I just had a little spasm in the Bayern Munich game. I’m fine. Nothing that stops me.” We speak on video call; she’s casual in a hoodie, with a massive rock on her ring finger and Moore sitting next to her. She keeps him off-camera, but regularly turns to check with him that she’s right about things like dates, or the ages of her siblings. They’re waiting to go to a spa for the afternoon. “Not so many days off in football, so we make the most of when we do get them,” she shrugs. It’s their dog Brody’s first birthday at the weekend. (She has two dogs, whom she refers to as “the boys”.) They’re throwing a little party for Brody and his brother, who belongs to her mum. And after the party she’ll be reporting for international duty at St George’s Park, the final England camp of the year before friendlies against China and Ghana. The bounce back continues. (It may have hit a temporary bump in the road. A couple of weeks later, Kelly was injured during the first half of the Ghana match. Arsenal manager Renée Slegers gave an update at a press conference in early December, calling it “an injury, a little ligament in the back of her knee”. It looks as if Kelly will be sidelined until Christmas. “We’ll see,” Slegers has said.) ew footballers are as cool and composed on the pitch as this striker, no matter how high-pressure the situation. She is regularly described by commentators as a combination of . In 2022, in the Euros final, she scored the winning goal for England against Germany – her ecstatic top-off celebration earned her a yellow card – but to do it again required next-level calm. In 2025, the England-Spain final had come down to penalties. It was up to Kelly to bring it home for a second time. She took her trademark run-up and thumped it past the Spanish keeper, then jogged back to her teammates as if there had never been any question that England would do it all over again. Her family feel the pressure far more than she does, she says. “Scott definitely gets nervous. When I asked him, did you think I was going to score a penalty against Spain, he said yes. Whereas my brothers were … quite nervous.” Did they say no? “They didn’t say . They just said it was nerve-racking!” Kelly is so preternaturally collected and confident that sports psychologists must be fascinated by her. “I work closely with psychologists, to make sure my game is at the top,” she nods. “It doesn’t just happen overnight. I think throughout my career … maybe I’m too confident at times? But I really back myself. I like to play on the edge quite a lot.” It wasn’t always that way. She was 19 when she got her first senior England cap. “I went on to the pitch and my legs were just like jelly,” she recalls. It wasn’t until she tore her anterior cruciate ligament in 2021 that her mindset began to shift. “Before my ACL, I was definitely more of a nervous player. Having the injury allowed me to think, what am I nervous for? I’ve gone through the worst situation and I’ve had to do my rehab for that. So what is fazing me?” The injury was no surprise in a way; research suggests that ; this WSL season alone, seven players, including Kelly’s fellow Lioness Michelle Agyemang and Arsenal teammate Katie Reid, have suffered an ACL injury. Players have spoken out about a congested calendar, including the England captain, . Is it being taken seriously enough? What can be done? “For me, there’s not enough research because, actually, we haven’t been professionals for long enough,” says Kelly. She lists potential issues: who knows what kind of boot design is better for women’s feet, or what sort of pitch is right for women? “But what I will say is, the negativity around ACLs make it harder to go through, than actually what it is.” What does she mean? “If a player does their ACL and the first thing you see is negativity around it, it automatically puts you in a negative mindset,” she says. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the way I think.” From a sprain to a break, any injury can be tough, but the ACL has become a particular kind of bogeyman. The first thing she told Reid was: “It’s gonna be tough and it’s gonna be horrible, but it’s not as bad as sometimes it is [portrayed as being]. You know you’re missing a long period of time, but any injury you’re going to miss that.” There needs to be far more research into why women appear to be more susceptible, Kelly insists. “The calendar is crazy. You want the best players on the pitch, but maybe there’s too many games in the calendar, in both women and men’s football, for our bodies to deal with the loading.” For Kelly, the hardest moment in her professional life was not her ACL injury. “It was not being able to control what was happening in my career.” She is talking about the events that finally came to a head in January. “It was a dark time,” she says. She had been at Manchester City since 2020, but her relationship with the club had soured. She spent most of her time on the bench, starting only once in the first nine matches of the season. In November 2024, England manager Sarina Wiegman described . “Chloe knows that she is not in the best position with her club at the moment,” Wiegman said. , stating that her future was not with the club, and asking to be released from her contract, adding that, “to be dictated whom I can and can’t join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career but my mental wellbeing”. City allowed her to leave and join Arsenal on loan for the rest of the season.(She signed for them permanently in July.) But the drama continued. Just over a day later, she posted another note, accusing the club of and planting negative stories in the football press. Looking back on the situation in August, City’s then boss Gareth Taylor told the BBC that he had “Taking charge of your own destiny is massive,” Kelly says, today. “After we won the Champions League, I said, write your own script, control your destiny, and I stick by that. Because I wasn’t in a position to do so for so long, but speaking out for what you believe in is huge.” She is proud to have come back from those dark days. “But also, on reflection, I wish I spoke earlier.” So no regrets, other than that you wish you’d done it sooner? “No, definitely no regrets,” she says, firmly. Goalkeeper Mary Earps was Kelly’s teammate for years, and they won England’s first Euros trophy together. In , Earps went public about her feelings towards Hannah Hampton, who replaced her as England’s No 1. She wrote about how she felt that Hampton’s , and accused Wiegman of rewarding it. The story was massive, sending shock waves through the world of women’s football. Other players shared their views on it. Lucy Bronze argued that female players are . Former Lioness Ellen White spoke of an , that what happens in the dressing room, stays in the team. So has Kelly read the book? “I haven’t,” she says, though she is clearly prepared for it to come up, and looks as unruffled as ever. “I think, for me, I’m in a position where Hannah is my teammate, and we support our teammates. We support Mary, who was our teammate, too. Mary’s told her story. And, of course, in football, you don’t really see it too often, but I think, for me, Mary’s voiced herself.” In her own statement about Man City, Kelly said she felt it was “time to be open and transparent”. Is this a similar situation? She disagrees. “I think, for me, it was either, I speak up and I speak out on what was happening, or I take a step away from the game. Mary’s situation is obviously writing a book of her whole journey. So, probably a little different.” And, honestly, Kelly jokes, she’s really not a reader. “For me, both are my teammates, and I’m proud to stand side by side with my teammates.” That’s very tactful and balanced, I say. “But that’s me! I can’t comment on something if I haven’t read the whole book. Maybe one day I’ll listen to the audiobook. Because reading is To many, and for good reason, Kelly is a hero. Predictably, to some, her self-belief can seem like arrogance. There are corners of the internet where people post about how she comes across as cocky, or cringe. When she says that she might be “too confident”, what does she mean? Sometimes, she explains, she’ll have confidence on the pitch, and then afterwards she’ll be hard on herself, and wonder if she could have done it differently, or done it better. “Maybe that’s ‘too confident’. But I think confidence is huge. Especially as a woman, to be able to step on to a pitch or to be able to step into a room, I feel a lot of confidence within myself. I think that comes from playing with my brothers and growing up with my mum and dad. They would say, be yourself, and just don’t change who you are.” elly is the youngest of seven. She has one sister, Paris, who doesn’t like football. “She wishes me good luck, and she’ll say to me, ‘Oh, your hair looked lovely today’, but she couldn’t care less if I score, if I miss, if I have a great game, if I have a bad game,” she says, not unhappily. She has five brothers, three of whom are triplets, and they had a big role in making her confident, tough and unflappable. She grew up playing in the cages of the Windmill Park estate, in Southall, west London. There’s a commemorative plaque there now in her honour. “If I bring someone to my mum’s house, me and Scott are always, like, let’s drive to show them the cages,” she says. “It’s a very special place to me. Always will be.” Her brothers never treated her differently because she was a girl. “They never made it easy. Even to their friends, they’d say, ‘Don’t go easy on her, she’s playing here with us.’” Her oldest brother is 10 years older than her, but playing against his friends never fazed her. “I’d be, like, ‘I can beat you, let’s go,’” she grins. “They’d say to my brothers, she’s a bit cheeky, ain’t she?” And did you beat them? “Yeah,” she says. “I think sometimes I did. Sometimes I lost! But I learned from it.” At school, she played on boys’ teams. She would arrive for a match and know they were being judged for having a girl on the squad. “And then I’d come away with player of the tournament. And I remember seeing my mum’s face, like, so proud, saying, ‘You did it, girl.’” She knew then that football was what she wanted to do. “And, academically, I wasn’t too clever,” she laughs. “Still ain’t.” Unlike some of her teammates, who felt they needed a backup career and qualifications outside football, Kelly never had a plan B. “I actually didn’t, I won’t lie. I just always wanted to be a footballer, and that was my overconfidence.” Then she remembers that she did have another job. “I worked for one day,” she laughs. “I went to work with one of my friends, at an Olly Murs concert. We sold merchandise, and I was, like … I don’t want to do this.” She describes her parents as “hard-working people”. Her father fits big machinery, she says, then turns to Moore. “Is that a rigger?” Her mum worked at the same nursery school that Kelly attended and, later, worked with children with additional needs. Neither of them drove, which meant that getting their daughter to training sessions involved a lot of early morning buses and trains. When she was 16, Kelly got the call to train with the Arsenal first team, then known as Arsenal Ladies. She had her first professional contact by 18. The money was so bad that her father had to help her out with her living costs. “I was on a professional contract, but my dad would pay me each week so that I could get to training and I could actually live,” she says. It is a sign of how much the women’s game has grown, and how quickly. And that was less than 10 years ago? “Yeah. 2017, I’d say?” Her salary is not disclosed, but in 2023 Forbes estimated her annual club earnings to be £400,000. She was playing for Everton when she met Moore, a groundsman there. I want to talk about him, I say, but is it awkward if he’s sitting next to you? “No!” she beams. “It’s fine! I always speak about Scott, whether I’m with him, or not.” At the time, Kelly was in rehab, recovering from a torn syndesmosis and subsequent ankle surgery. “I was coming out of the indoor astro [pitch], and Scott was walking behind me. I held the door open for him, and that was our first interaction.” She laughs. “When I say interaction, he said, ‘Thank you.’ And I said, ‘It’s OK.’” Moore plucked up the courage to slide into Kelly’s DMs, but the message languished in her requests. Eventually, she saw it, realised they had mutual friends, and they started to talk. Moore took her to Ikea for their first date, and she asked him to stay and help her build the furniture. I remember sending a picture to my mum of Scott putting the drawers together,” she says. Their story sounds impossibly sweet. “We’d go and get milkshakes, or just have a drive. We used to go to just watch the planes come in at Liverpool airport. Even now, we’re inseparable.” They got married in July 2024. A week before their first wedding anniversary, Kelly was playing for England against Sweden in the Euros, in that hellish quarter-final match, though she says it was her favourite of the tournament. She wore Moore works with Kelly’s management team now. “Honestly, I love it,” she says. “It’s funny, because when we text about work we don’t put any kisses. It’s just direct, blunt. Then we talk about something else, it’s just two kisses, after every text. So the balance is amazing. It allows us to spend a lot of time together, which, in football, is crazy, so you have to make the most of that.” Who does he support? “Scott’s an Evertonian, so it was nice that I played for the club,” she says. And when you’re playing for Arsenal, does that change anything? “Well, no. To be honest, at our wedding, in his speech, he said the best thing to come out of Everton was our relationship,” she laughs. “I hold a close place in my heart for Everton, especially with the happiness that it has brought me in my relationship. But I’m a QPR fan, so I don’t celebrate too much, either!” elly’s fellow Lioness Ella Toone tells a story about when she first realised she might be famous. “I got papped eating a pasty in Tyldesley,” she said, . What about Kelly? After the 2022 Euros, she remembers taking her nieces and nephews to Legoland, where people kept stopping her, asking for pictures. “My nieces and nephews were  like, ‘Chloe, is this gonna happen all the time?’ They were so confused.” Are they excited that you’re well-known? “They just see me as their auntie! They don’t see me as Chloe, the footballer.” But her nephew sometimes texts her if he’s playing EA Sports FC (the video game that used to be called Fifa). “He’ll get me, and he’s, like, ‘Look, Chloe, who I’ve got in my team!’ But I don’t know if they realise how huge the women’s game has got.” As the women’s game grows in popularity, so does the scrutiny. “There’s definitely misogyny when women are successful. People don’t like women being successful. People don’t like women being in an environment where maybe you don’t think we should be,” says Kelly. Fire and ice, they say, but that’s the fire, right there. “We are exactly where we should be, and we’re here to stay.” Does she think that female players are held to a higher standard? She says she’s not sure, to be honest, and that plenty of male players are on the receiving end of harsh criticism and comments. But the pressures are a little different. “I think as women players, we try to be the best, inspiring young girls, inspiring women to take a step into something that they enjoy and something that they can be great at.” But what’s different is that you don’t often get comments about male players’ appearances. “For sure. If you comment on if I’m good or bad at football, that’s fine. That’s your opinion.” She has to listen to the opinions of the staff every day. “If you’re going to comment on me as a human being, it’s a little bit different, but I am myself, and I’ll be myself wherever I go. For young girls that maybe are a little more insecure, that’s when it’s not nice.” Still, she tries to see it from another angle. “But I guess it’s a sign that we are being more successful than they wanted us to be.” found that over the course of a single weekend in the Premier League and WSL, more than 2,000 abusive messages, including death and rape threats, were sent to players and managers on social media. “You obviously see it,” says Kelly, on trolling, which she struggles to understand, adding that she doesn’t watch tennis, but that doesn’t mean she’s about to start slating tennis players. “I’m not going troll you for doing your job. It just doesn’t make sense to me. I’d love to be in a world full of full of peace and happiness. But, yeah,” she sighs, “we’re a million miles off that.” Kelly has started to notice that, as well as young girls, more boys are looking up to female players now.  “I meet so many that say, ‘Oh, you’re my idol, you’re my favourite player.’ Which is amazing, because  actually, we’ve changed something. You’re actually changing the mindsets of those young boys, and as they grow up they will then teach their kids that this is normal.” Kelly has a lot of plans outside football. She’s becoming a more regular fixture on red carpets, joining the fashion set at the , wearing see-through bejewelled couture at the . She’d like to move into fashion herself and wants to show more of her personality off the pitch. “And I would love to have a family. For me, being around my family so much, I’d love to have one of my own.” But she isn’t thinking too hard about that just yet, because there’s something else on her mind. “I’ll know when the time is right, and right now I have a World Cup to get to and to win. So my focus is to make sure that I’m at my best to represent England.” And how is she feeling about the World Cup? She smiles. “I don’t look too far ahead. Who knows what the journey looks like to get there?” But, equally, she can’t help herself. “I’m hungry,” she says.”",Rebecca Nicholson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/wsl-at-halfway-best-of-the-season-so-far-moving-the-goalposts,"WSL at halfway: best of the season, second-half hopes and biggest gripe",2025-12-16T12:26:27.000Z,"With 11 games played our writers assess what has been good and not so good in England’s top flight as the league takes a winter break This was a tough one, and an honourable mention has to be given to Martin Ho, who, despite only two summer signings, has taken Tottenham one point past last season’s 20-point total with half the season to play. However, Andrée Jeglertz arrived at Manchester City after managing Denmark at the Euros, where his team failed to pick up a point, and has had an instant impact. City look a different beast under the 53-year-old. The league leaders’ opening-day defeat by Chelsea is firmly in the past: they have won all 10 games since, have scored eight more goals than any other side and have built a six point lead at the top. Where previously City had struggled to kill off matches against title rivals, this season there has been a ruthlessness epitomised by their late winner in , after they had twice given up the lead, and a comprehensive There can be only one answer here: City. They are playing like potential champions and have used wide areas to great effect. Khadija “Bunny” Shaw is scoring at a rate of more than a goal a game, Lauren Hemp, Aoba Fujino, Kerolin and Kerstin Casparij are at the top of their game and City even coped well despite their captain Alex Greenwood’s recent injury, the sort of absence that might have prompted them to capitulate in previous seasons. Sydney Lohmann and Grace Clinton have settled well, and Vivianne Miedema has created an impressive 22 chances in 11 games as a No 10. Centre-back was a position where City had to strengthen and they opted for a youthful choice with the 22-year-old Canada defender Jade Rose. Amid the team’s flurry of goals at the other end, Rose has gone under the radar but done a really mature, steady job for her age, defending well with 42 clearances but also threading through balls and carrying the ball higher up the pitch. Honourable mentions go to the 19-year-old Tottenham centre-back Toko Koga, Jess Park for her form after signing for United and Ellie Carpenter’s excellent performances for Chelsea, while Beata Olsson has done well for Liverpool with five goals in nine games. Shaw continues to underline why she is one of the best strikers in the world at the moment, if not best. After her last campaign was interrupted by injury issues, she has found her groove. Her scoring ability is second to none: she has 12 goals, seven more than anyone else in the league. Not content with bringing up her 100th in 120 appearances for Manchester City against Aston Villa, she went on to get her 101st, 102nd and 103rd. She does not only score goals, however, but is integral to the way City build. City have caught the eye with their dynamic attacking football and her ever-developing connection with Miedema has been a joy to watch in these opening months. After Arsenal’s stunning and battling run to a , expectations were high. However, they are eight points adrift of City, one defeat and four draws (against Chelsea, Manchester United, Aston Villa and Tottenham) leaving them only a point ahead of United and two ahead of Tottenham. What’s clear is Arsenal’s squad, the oldest in the league, needed an overhaul in the summer that didn’t come. Injuries have taken a toll but they are no excuse with the depth in their number. Meanwhile, dressing-room disharmony has been a factor. At the very least, they need to rediscover the doggedness that powered them to victory in Lisbon in May, and changes in January could reset things. Scheduling has long been a contentious subject as leagues and broadcasters try to find the right window for fixtures that will suit both TV viewership and spectators. The decision, however, to move most games to a noon kick-off has caused ructions among WSL fans. Midday is a time wholly unsuitable for match-goers – unless it is a local derby, it increases the difficulty for travelling fans and cost. The fact that too – only 71,000 tuned in to watch one of the biggest games of the season between Arsenal and Chelsea – compounds the issue. In addition, many of this season’s matches have been held at the same time, leading to a lack of momentum throughout a weekend and a misunderstanding of the fact that a strong proportion of the women’s football fanbase watch more than just their own team. WSL Football has said it will reconsider in the summer but you can’t help but feel it has hindered potential growth off the back of the Lionesses’ summer success. after eight WSL players endured that fate in the first half of the season, including Brighton’s Michelle Agyemang, the Liverpool duo Marie Höbinger and Sophie Román Haug and most recently Tottenham’s Jessica Naz. On a lighter note, it would be welcome to have a reduction in the number of unofficial tactical timeouts managers are enjoying while goalkeepers receive treatment, usually bang on the 22-minute mark or when their side are under heavy pressure. And purely for the sake of the morale of women’s football fans on Merseyside, it would be nice to see Liverpool and/or Everton finally win a home league game.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/23/moving-goalposts-germany-frauen-bundesliga-wsl,‘We’ve fallen behind’: why Germany’s biggest teams have split from DFB,2025-12-23T13:37:37.000Z,"Ownership of Frauen-Bundesliga is being taken over by the clubs, who want to  keep pace with game in England “The reason we started this whole process was a fear of losing more and more the connection to the top,” says Katharina Kiel, the head of women’s football at Alongside her role at one of Germany’s more successful women’s football teams, Kiel was this month elected president of the new Women’s Bundesliga Association, after all 14 clubs agreed to split from the German Football Federation (DFB) and form their own committee to take ownership of the league to further commercialise and grow it, with the 2027-28 campaign a targeted start date. with the Women’s Super League a couple of years ago, there are many hurdles to overcome, but Kiel, 33 and a former Bundesliga player, explains what the plan is. “We started this process two years ago, so it’s been going on a while,” she says. “We managed to touch on certain things, such as our competitiveness internationally, because as you know Germany was a very successful place for women’s football, but there became a point when England in particular stepped up and managed their development really well to grow quickly. “We also felt there was a reality our players started to look abroad, so there’s a few reasons we started it, but also for the love of the game, and as a woman myself and a former player I have a strong, strong belief in this league and women’s football as it is now. “We had a decision: to keep up or stay where we are. The Euros in 2022 saw the whole industry in England develop very exponentially and that’s why here we said on the cost side we would see that growth but the revenue streams have not been parallel, and it was not possible to keep up with the costs. We didn’t have our development in our own hands, it was with the DFB, but it is the clubs investing in the sport, which is why our first big step was to unite as clubs.” Bayern Munich have been pioneers in recent years, winning multiple Bundesliga titles and competing in the latter stages of the Champions League. Bianca Rech, a former Bayern player, has worked at the club for almost a decade in various roles, now as a director, and says commercial growth has been high on the agenda when looking at the WSL as an example. “We have clear ideas when it comes to the commercial side to make much more money when it comes to sponsorship,” she says. “The other part is the ability to make our own decisions. We are part of the DFB but don’t have any power, so if the DFB want to do something we have to say yes. “It’s important for us we set some new rules ourselves, around infrastructure, minimum salaries, etc. We did a lot of research and benchmarking against other leagues and we looked at the WSL as a good example of taking charge of itself. We actually worked with an agency in England to help provide examples of how we want it to look.” Rech, like Kiel, believes Germany missed out on capitalising on past successes, such as back-to-back World Cup wins or their multiple European Championship triumphs. That has meant falling behind England and Spain in recent years, with a disastrous 2023 World Cup ending in a group-stage exit. Rech says: “We missed out in 2011 to use the power compared to England in 2022, the celebrations, the fan growth, etc … But now with the , the development of the game, women’s football is one of the fastest-growing products and we have to make sure we don’t lose track.” Those Euros in 2029 offer a chance to commercialise the sport but Kiel says decisions will not be rushed. “You have to look at certain timelines and when is a good time to bring change into place?” says Kiel. “Our new media cycle begins in 2027-28, so to bring up change for next season would be very, very late for us now. “We’ll use next season to get things sorted, but also to form a group and an organisation which is capable of providing commercially and economically for the clubs and for the league. We have started this month with the foundation but we are in the process of getting everything done and creating the criteria every club can commit to for 2027-28.” On keeping up with the WSL, Kiel says: “We have fallen behind – it is the reality. People try and differentiate between the Bundesliga and Premier League in the men’s game, but the Premier League is so far away. But for us the WSL hasn’t pulled so far away yet.” There is belief and excitement that this can spark a new era of success in Germany, with many of the country’s biggest clubs either in the Bundesliga or closing in on it, and the national team still developing top young players who can compete on an international stage. “There’s a huge opportunity in Germany right now,” Rech says. “You look at the league, teams on the way up, Stuttgart, Dortmund, the league will look different, maybe more compatible with the men’s league.” Kiel says: “Most important is the product you see on the field, and everything around that has to be aligned. We want an attractive game, that’s important for us, and from that we will look at all the consequences that are needed.” On whether that could include involvement from the DFB, Kiel says: “We cannot not talk with them because they are running the league now, so there are some negotiations on certain topics, and topics regarding future collaboration are still open.” If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email",Rich Laverty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mbappé missed several earlier chances before getting his chance from the spot four minutes from time and he made no mistake to net his 59th goal in as many games across all competitions in 2025 to level Ronaldo’s 2013 haul. Jude Bellingham put Real in front with a header seven minutes before half-time and went down to 10 men with 22 minutes remaining after Marcão received a second booking but the hosts had keeper Thibaut Courtois to thank for keeping them ahead. “Today, and because of the record, it’s incredible, in my first year to be able to do what Cristiano did,” Mbappé said afterwards. “My idol, the best player in the history of and a reference in world football. It’s an honour for me.” Mbappé marked his goal by reproducing Ronaldo’s celebration, saying later: “I wanted to give him a little nod because he has always been affectionate with me. Normally I have my own celebration, but I wanted to share that with him, and like I said, he’s been my idol since I was a kid.

The hosts took the lead when Xaver Schlager threaded his shot past two defenders after a fine solo effort for a 35th-minute goal. Leverkusen, however, needed just four minutes to turn the game on its head. Martin Terrier was on target with a looping header to equalise in the 40th minute and they completed their comeback in the 44th with Patrik Schick wrongfooting Kosta Nedeljkovic and then curling his shot past Peter Gulacsi. Leipzig tried to come back after the break and Conrad Harder and David Raum went close but they conceded a third goal in stoppage time through Montrell Culbreath for their first home loss of the season after six consecutive victories.

Pejcinovic had not scored in the before but the 20-year-old forward, starting because Mohamed Amoura was at the Africa Cup of Nations, made his mark with three goals as Wolfsburg exploited defensive errors by Freiburg.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/26/parma-coach-carlos-cuesta-leaving-arsenal-was-maybe-the-most-difficult-decision-of-my-life,Parma coach Carlos Cuesta: ‘Leaving Arsenal was maybe the most difficult decision of my life’,2025-12-26T12:00:08.000Z,"Spaniard, who at 30 has been coaching for half his life, discusses Arteta, tactics and how to win players’ trust arlos Cuesta, towards the end of his first major interview, briefly lets himself wonder how far his journey will take him. “Maybe one day it brings the Maldives,” he says with a laugh, the joke being football managers can quickly be banished from view, twiddling their thumbs on the beach, once their star has faded. Still, would that be so bad? “It could be better or worse, it depends when or why. If it’s because you want it, or if it’s because somebody told you to go.” If soaking up rays sounds like anathema to Cuesta it is because, in a remarkable ascent, he has barely wasted a minute. In June, shortly before turning 30, he took the reins at Parma and became the . Half of his short life had been spent building up to that moment, the realisation crystallising in his late teens that no other calling would do. “I felt that I needed to coach,” he says. “It was like an inner necessity that I had inside of me.” Cuesta had been coveted long before his arrival in Emilia-Romagna. It was during a five-year spell as one of Mikel Arteta’s assistants at Arsenal that he matured from inquisitive, ferociously diligent tyro into an elite manager in waiting. Nobody involved with the Premier League leaders would play down Cuesta’s influence; the public received a glimpse when he featured in the club’s three years ago. Parting ways brought its own agony. “It was maybe the most difficult decision of my life,” he says of the moment Parma called. Cuesta had to weigh the sense he was aboard a rocket ship against the privilege of being sought by a club feted for its . “I was incredibly happy at Arsenal, surrounded by incredible people in an incredible project. Not only with great players and a path that is only growing and growing, but with a person who has been incredibly important for me, which is Mikel.” Arteta would never have stood in Cuesta’s way. Other clubs had long been hovering. “I needed to consider a lot of things but in the end I had a great feeling with the people at ,” Cuesta says. “It’s an amazing, historic club. You can feel there has been success here and, at the same time, there have been many ups and downs. Right now, we are trying to create our own path and our own chapter.” To Parma, all the way from Palma. Cuesta was born in Mallorca, the youngest of four siblings, then 12, 11 and nine. “I was like the penalty,” he quips, but the age gap with his sister and two brothers meant there was little sparring. “It was the opposite,” he says. “They are like extra dad or mum figures. They’ve helped a lot in my education, my standards, my way of approaching life. I guess, through my childhood, I was living in a process that helped me mature a little bit earlier than usual.” He played for Santa Catalina Atlético, a local lower-division side, until 18 but knew his prospects were limited. “I was a footballer that was on the pitch but not making a difference,” he admits. Life nonetheless revolved around the club. His mother ran its coffee shop; he would go there after school, hang out into the evening, immerse himself in the institution’s rhythms. “In this kind of way, I think it got into my blood,” he says. By 15, he had been invited to coach youngsters at Santa Catalina. What had the club’s elders spotted? “Passion for the game, I guess. And maybe a kid that had some time off, spending so long there! Perhaps when I was playing I was a little bit vocal too. But I was watching a lot of games and trying to understand the ‘why?’, trying to understand how things can improve.” The die was cast. Cuesta was confident, academically bright and ambitious. He wanted a career around football and for a short time considered sports journalism. The inner cry to make his name in coaching had become overwhelming by the time he began a sports science degree in Madrid. “I tried to be proactive in order to make it happen,” he says. Social media proved invaluable. Cuesta followed a number of staff from Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid on Twitter, eventually striking up conversations that brought a role in the latter’s academy alongside his studies. Atlético was “almost like the real university”: their coaches had spotted a precocious talent and he began working with their under-nines, eventually taking charge at under-14 level. Cuesta was motivated “to try and spend time with people that could add value for me”. During a year out after leaving Atlético he crammed in visits to clubs, managers, seminars and tournaments. Among the yields was a connection with Juventus, where he spent two years with the under-17s and under-23s. He was 22. “If Atlético was the university, Juventus was the master’s,” he says. “An incredible experience. Learning things like the attention to detail on tactics, on defensive aspects of the game.” Then came the call from Arteta, who was eight months in at . The pair had forged a relationship during Arteta’s time at Manchester City when Cuesta “had the opportunity to share some thoughts” with a coach whose outlook he already admired. He became one of Arteta’s most trusted lieutenants and the pair still communicate regularly. His face illuminates with every chance to extol his mentor’s virtues. “An incredible person,” he says. “He has always been extremely supportive through the whole process and still is. I can’t speak well enough about who he is, not just as a leader and a coach but as a human being.” The clarity, single-mindedness and intensity Cuesta exhibits during an hour-long conversation at Parma’s training centre bring easy comparison to the Arteta who, before his playing days wound down, was sketching out detailed visions of a life in management. Sometimes Cuesta finds himself rising at dawn and finishing work at 10pm, although he will try to at least operate from home in the evening. Long hours are an Arteta trait and so is a pragmatism that Cuesta, in trying to keep Parma from the relegation zone, may need to deploy at the expense of idealism. “You have your own sensibility and beliefs about what the game is, but I think it’s very important to have this flexibility to understand what the context requires,” he says. “It’s not always possible to do what you like, but you always have to do what is needed. There will be moments where what you like is needed or possible, but there will be many others where you just need to maximise the resources at your disposal and do your best. “That’s why I think, the bigger the spectrum of your knowledge and ability to convince players to do certain things, the better a coach you will be. I try to learn from many.” His initial role at Arsenal was individual development coach, which involved one-on-one work with players focusing on aspects of their game. The dressing room of Arteta’s early days was not outwardly the easiest to enter, even before considering Cuesta was 25 and almost unknown. Senior players embraced him swiftly though; the All or Nothing clip in which he animatedly, yet concisely, talks Ben White through his “world-class” attributes is a widely available example of his talents. “I tried to observe, to listen, to intervene only when I thought I could add some value, and from there to slowly try to get their credibility and trust,” he says. “When the player feels you can do that, and that you’re a good person with honesty, good intentions and good values, they follow and respect you.” Any flicker of fame from becoming a minor television star was, he says, blanked out by obsession with the day-to-day. That focus continues at Parma, where he oversees the third-youngest team in Europe’s top five leagues. We meet soon after a win at Pisa that pulls them well clear of the drop; three days later they are dragged back towards it by a home defeat to Lazio, whose winner comes after they had two men sent off. Consistency will take time. Perhaps his youth helps him relate to a much-changed squad that lost players such as , in the summer. “Maybe the age can be a factor in terms of empathy,” he says. “We’re trying to create the competitive mindset we need to overcome adversity and develop. The players have been absolutely incredible – they are growing.” The quest for self-growth continues too. Cuesta reads voraciously: he frequently dips into a translation of the Chinese text Tao Te Ching, one of whose central tenets is self-awareness. Sacred Hoops, by the former NBA coach Phil Jackson, is another that “I usually have around”. Inspiration comes from numerous sources and the days when the wallpaper on his phone was a picture of the Champions League trophy, incentivising him with the most thrilling target available, are long gone. “Not any more, look!” he says, holding up a more nondescript background. “The only thing I have is the present. In this job you need to reframe ‘time’. For me, time right now means today is my everything.” The Maldives still feel a galaxy away.",Nick Ames,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick Bamford had looked like stealing the headlines with a well-taken early double for the visitors but Wrexham powered back to claim their first win in six league outings. With his short-term contract due to expire on New Year’s Day, Bamford put himself in the shop window as he scored either side of a Tyler Bindon own goal. Callum O’Hare added a third for Chris Wilder’s side but responded through Moore and levelled through Ryan Longman. Moore put them ahead for the first time and a Josh Windass penalty completed the fightback. stretched their lead at the top of the Championship to eight points with a hard-fought 1-0 win over . Ephron Mason-Clark’s emphatic finish just before half-time was enough to give Frank Lampard’s side a ninth home Championship win of the season. But the usually free-scoring Sky Blues were made to work hard for the points and were perhaps somewhat fortunate to have found themselves in front at half-time. The resolute visitors had done a fine job in keeping the hosts quiet but were undone a minute before the break by Mason-Clark’s opener. It failed to spark Coventry into life with the hosts fading once again after a good spell of pressure early in the second half. It was the visitors who enjoyed the best of the second-half chances and could well have snatched a point with better finishing after both Liam Cullen and Melker Widell wasted good opportunities to equalise. It leaves City – who are unbeaten at home this season – with a commanding 13-point cushion on the chasing pack in the playoff zone as they look to bring Premier League football to Coventry for the first time in 25 seasons. Imrân Louza played a starring role with two assists as came from behind to win 2-1 at and claim back-to-back victories for the first time this season. Louza, Watford’s captain, crossed for Mattie Pollock to head the winner in the 65th minute, after teeing up Othmane Maamma for the away side’s leveller on the stroke of half-time. Jordan James had fired Leicester into the lead in the seventh minute with a deflected effort from Jordan Ayew’s pass but the Foxes were unable to find an equaliser once Watford went ahead.

Matt Crooks earned the Tigers a point at Hillsborough with a 65th-minute leveller after Bailey Cadamarteri had restored the Owls’ advantage. Hull stay fourth, below Ipswich on goal difference, while the hosts move on to minus eight points but remain without a home league victory this season after their wretched winless run stretched to 16 games.

The Rams were reduced in numbers just before the interval when Joe Ward was dismissed for picking up two bookings in quick succession. That left the visitors on the back foot but Birmingham also saw a man dismissed during stoppage time when the home captain, Christoph Klarer, was sent off after a reckless challenge on the substitute Ebou Adams. Despite being the season of goodwill, the match was a niggly affair from the start with the Derby manager, John Eustace, also booked for overstepping the mark with the fourth official, returning to face the club he managed before being replaced by Wayne Rooney. came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at 10-man with a stoppage-time goal from Ben Thompson and put themselves a point behind leaders Walsall. New Rovers manager Steve Evans looked to be set for a first home win after goals from Jack Sparkes and Fabrizio Cavegn before the break.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/22/juventus-creep-into-title-race-while-ferguson-struggles-to-convince-gasperini,Juventus creep into title race while Ferguson struggles to convince Gasperini,2025-12-22T10:00:24.000Z,"Whoever wins season’s Scudetto is likely to crawl over the line and Juve have entered the picture hen you say things like that, it makes me want to bite you,” Luciano Spalletti told a Sky Sport Italia reporter asking about title ambitions. Treating interviewers like a slice of panettone aside, the most shocking thing about this assertion is that it’s not entirely implausible. have barely scraped a few good performances, but the overwhelming sense of inconsistency throughout Serie A means that’s no reason to rule them out for the top prize. Spalletti can tuck into his Christmas dinner knowing Juventus beat Roma 2-1 to close within a point of fourth place, securing three competitive wins in a row, with Loïs Openda finally breaking his duck, and Bremer returning for his first start sincehis meniscus tear on 27 September. The quality in the squad was always present, so with a little confidence, momentum and players beginning to gel with their new coach, there’s plenty for fans to get their teeth into. Juventus remain painfully dependent on Kenan Yildiz, but there are worse players to rely on. He was once again sprinkling Turkish delight around the pitch against Roma, although he is, if anything, too generous in his work off the ball. “His opponents know how good he is, but I don’t think he yet realises how good he is,” said Spalletti. Compare and contrast to Edon Zhegrova, who came on, gave the ball away and allowed Tommaso Baldanzi topull a goal back. “When Zhegrova has to defend, he becomes liquid.” With a bit of training, he could at least get to the consistency of a pannacotta. “I am not convinced,” was the review of Evan Ferguson’s performance from Gian Piero Gasperini after Roma suffered yet another defeat in the head-to-head clashes. “It’s not just him.” Gasperini cast the net of disappointment over fellow summer loan signings Leon Bailey and Kostas Tsimikas. All three arrived from the Premier League and have intermittently featured, Gasperini repeatedly hinting they weren’t doing enough in training to convince him they were worth a shot. When Bailey did come on against Juve, he lasted 20 minutes before limping off with his umpteenth muscular injury. We are constantly told the Premier League sides train so much harder and with such commitment, yet these three have failed to impress Roma staff. “If I had to choose between Paulo Dybala and Ferguson, I’d choose Dybala all day, every day,” reiterated Gasperini. “You need more to be a centre-forward than being tall. It’s not just about technique, he hasn’t settled into the spirit of this team.” Roma might save money by cutting short the Ferguson loan from Brighton, Bailey’s from Aston Villa, and Tsimikas’s from Liverpool, to then bring in the correct ingredients for Gasp’s tactical recipe. It’s a little disconcerting they are looking to the Premier League again for their replacements, above all Joshua Zirkzee from Manchester United, though at least he already has experience of Serie A from Bologna and Parma. Lazio 0-0 Cremonese, Juventus 2-1 AS Roma, Cagliari 2-2 Pisa, Sassuolo 0-1 Torino, Fiorentina 5-1 Udinese, Genoa 0-1 Atalanta When everyone in the league looks so eminently beatable, it makes for an unpredictable campaign. It’s not so much may the best team win, more like who crawls over the finish line first. The table was shaken up again this weekend, also because for the first time this season it had gaps in the schedule. Napoli, Inter, Milan and Bologna were all in Riyadh for the Supercoppa Italiana Final Four. Napoli will face Bologna for the trophy on Monday, so their week 16 fixtures won’t be played until mid-January. This hands Juve time to close the gap, aided by a relatively weak run of opponents to finish off 2025 and begin 2026, certainly compared to rival teams over the same period. If it’s not too late for Juventus to get into the Scudetto race, there might also be time for Fiorentina to save themselves from Serie B. They finally got their first win of the season, helped by an early red card for Udinese goalkeeper Maduka Okoye’s half-cooked sprint outside the area to meet Moise Kean, and taking full advantage for a 5-1 victory. It was somehow not the dumbest goalkeeping error of the weekend in Serie A. That goes to Genoa’s Nicola Leali for getting himself sent off within three minutes for clattering Daniel Maldini, and yet his teammates held out until the 94th minute before losing 1-0 to Atalanta, via Isak Hien’s late goal. Considering so many of Fiorentina’s problems are obviously down to mentality, a success like this just before Christmas could be the turning point they need. The Viola are busy taking action anyway, approaching Tottenham director Fabio Paratici to become the figurehead the club has been sorely lacking since the untimely death of Joe Barone in March 2024. Their fans had hoped for a club icon in Fiorentina bona fides such as Giancarlo Antognoni. Calling someone who spent decades at their bitter rivals Juventus, overseeing a financial scandal around artificially inflated transfer fees, will probably be harder to swallow than overcooked turkey.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liverpool’s Premier League title banked, now to spend nearly half a billion on new players. Milos Kerkez! Jeremie Frimpong! Florian Wirtz! Hugo Ekitiké!

The Failsworth via Beverley and Monaco billionaire has continued to as Ruben Amorim’s team oscillates wildly between being unwatchable – as in losing the Bigger Vase final to Spurs – to games . All while a surly Amorim didn’t ask to be born, you know. Sir Big Jim meanwhile has started to focus on investments outside of the UK, where many fans wish he would stay. That all said, published plans for a new Old Trafford suggest the old boy retains some sense of irony. Amorim. Not entirely sure this is good news for United fans. In the final year of the dark lord Ozzy Osborne, England’s much overlooked West Midlands have been a haven of Big Stuff Happening. Aston Villa missed out on returning to Bigger Cup after ropey VAR-ing on the Premier League’s final day. A summer of wailing in lugubrious Brummie tones followed as pesky profit and sustainability rules meant Unai Emery’s squad was trimmed rather than fattened. The result: the Villa . Better, even. Across town, the two Toms, Wagner and Brady, high-performanced Birmingham City into a bastion of Brumminess, League One conquered and a cross between Disney’s Magic Kingdom and the cover of the Floyd’s Animals. The winningest quarterback exec-produced a sub-Wrexham doc where the denouement was to be Blues winning the Freight Rover Trophy. A Hollywood ending? Nope, a Posh one, . With apologies to West Brom and Walsall, what about Wolves? Ah. As part of a man-management masterclass, Brendan Rodgers compared his Celtic team to a Honda Civic attempting to keep pace with a Ferrari. Given the Bhoys had just lost to Dundee, some were surprised he didn’t go the whole hog and liken his team to a jalopy with square wheels, doors that fall off to the sound of Swanee whistles, and an exhaust pipe with all smoke and glitter coming out of it. It was, of course, an attempt to get the board to open the transfer coffers, but the gambit didn’t work and Rodgers was We’re going well early with this one, because everyone can see this is already a shoo-in for Scotland, six months out. For it is written. The direction of travel after , the greatest feelgood story ever told, can only head one way. For this is Scotland. An inept opening loss to Haiti. A scrappy undeserved draw against Morocco. Then a glorious win over Brazil, Andrew Robertson somehow bundling one past his club teammate Alisson in the third minute as the prelude to an 87-minute rearguard action involving both posts, the crossbar, two missed penalties, three goalline clearance and 14 marginal VAR decisions (eight offside by less than an inch, six extremely generous handballs). Then missing out on the next round as one of the better third-place finishers by one goal. For it is told. But would any die-hard romantic have it any other way? To be honest: yes. Football Daily is far from a music snob. Some of our favourite pre-match music is by the likes of Gerry and the Pacemakers, John Denver, and the Band Of The Grenadier Guards, while Hi-Ho Silver Lining (Jeff Beck) and Hey Jude (John, Paul, George, Ringo, Mick and Tich) are hardly achingly trendy deep cuts. And yet we feel confident enough to assert that North London Forever is an aural atrocity, its limp denouement akin to the sensation of tepid water pumped into the ears, but without the benefits of dissolving or dislodging any impacted wax. But we’re not 100% sure what Arsenal should replace it with. Guns of Brixton? It’s more rousing, and while there’s a fairly glaring problem in the title, the one they’re using now isn’t exactly geographically or historically accurate given the club’s origin story, so let’s not pull too hard at threads.

Everyone outside the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham will by now have completely forgotten that the Copa Gianni happened at all. But it happened all right, even if it feels like a fever dream. In time, it’ll be remembered for three things: the beginning of Xabi Alonso and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Real Madrid careers; the beginning of the end of Xabi Alonso and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Real Madrid careers; and Donald Trump squirrelling away the original trophy, then ; if he can somehow make off with the World Cup itself next summer, he’ll have accumulated more than enough Fifa gold to melt down and strike that 24-carat toilet he’s been dreaming of for years. Reports that the mould has already been cast, and forms the shape of Gianni Infantino’s open mouth, are as yet unconfirmed. Everyone outside of Parkhead and Easter Road is hoping and praying the Jambos can break the Old Firm’s 40-year stranglehold on the title. Everyone also knows that Waddell’s Kilmarnock pipped them on the last day of the 1964-65 campaign on goal average; that Hay’s Celtic nipped ahead of them on goal difference during the final knockings of the 1985-86 season, seven minutes from glory, Dundee’s Albert Kidd, all that; and had the goal average/difference rules been switched vice versa between those aforementioned seasons, Hearts would have prevailed on both occasions. So how will Hearts be shattered this time? Goals scored? A playoff decided by a dubious last-second penalty? Whichever team has the nicest third kit? Whatever, we’re awarding this to whoever’s managing Celtic come April. Perhaps this is premature; if history is any guide, it’s almost certainly accurate. Mohamed Salah, whose response to Liverpool signing Bayer Leverkusen duo Jordan Love and Conan O’Brien was to with such feeling and spectacular velocity that he inadvertently qualified for both shot put and javelin at the 2028 Olympics. Having dragged Wolves clear of relegation and , Vítor Pereira admittedly had some credit in the bank when his team lost their first five games of the season. Still, handing a shiny new three-year contract to a coach who has burned through 15 clubs in his managerial career was a bold move, to say the least. Six weeks, zero league wins and an angry row with fans later, Pereira was given the boot. An honourable mention for Ivan Juric, rewarded for dismal stints in charge of Roma with a plum job at Serie A and Bigger Cup dark horses Atalanta. Except poor Ivan managed to balls things up again, lasting barely three months. So instead, the gong goes to Julen Lopetegui. Handed the keys to a West Ham rebuild, the Spanish manager succeeded only in boring fans to tears, , opting to repeat the same doomed cycle . In May, Lopetegui took the Qatar job, winning his first qualifier against 10-man, already-qualified Iran. After five games without a win, Qatar tackled the UAE on home soil, winning 2-1 and booking a Geopolitics World Cup spot. Nice work if you can get it, and Julen certainly Ange Postecoglou’s stint in charge of Spurs was an extremely mixed bag, but he left with to further build his reputation. Big Ange opted to hurl himself into the bin fire at Nottingham Forest, a club whose players and fans did not want a new manager. After a very public parting of ways with Nuno Espírito Santo, owner Evangelos Marinakis who had “promoted Greece” with his Bigger Vase win – despite Ange’s uncompromising playing style being the complete opposite of the conservative approach favoured by Nuno. The experiment lasted eight winless games, with Forest fans singing “sacked in the morning” during a loss to Midtjylland. After a collapse at home to Chelsea, Marinakis couldn’t even wait that long, getting out of his comfy seat mid-game . “I went out to do some running, came back to the dressing room and he was gone,” sighed Ryan Yates of Postecoglou’s exit. So ended the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history, 40 days of chaos that is still being cleaned up by Sean Dyche, the kind of no-nonsense survivalist who makes Nuno look tactically expansive. It’s hard to recall a new manager as immediately unpopular as Russell Martin at Rangers, whose fans made Forest supporters’ treatment of Postecoglou seem charitable. Arriving six months after at Premier League survival with Southampton, Martin immediately irritated some supporters by refusing to wear a suit on the touchline. Much worse was to come: repeated and very public digs at his players, by Club Brugge in Bigger Cup playoffs and a winless league start that left Rangers 10th in the table. As fans made their feelings clear with banners and a catchy “we hate you Martin” chant, the manager took his players wild swimming in Loch Lomond. Could it stop the team treading water? No. Three weeks later, with fans crowding around the team bus after a 1-1 draw at Falkirk, Martin – and went back to Loch Lomond for some post-sacking recovery work. OK, there might not be a title parade in either TW8 or SR5 next May, but a tip of the hat must be offered to both Brentford and Sunderland for defying the doom-mongers (and Big Website) this season by keeping well clear of relegation trouble. Brentford lost key players and manager Thomas Frank over the summer but have relaunched themselves as long-throw revivalists – and sit within a few points of the clubs that poached their best talent. As for Sunderland, they appear to have cracked the code for promoted teams by actually investing their TV riches according to a cohesive plan. Europe is more likely than a relegation battle for Régis Le Bris’s boys, and we’re here for it. La Liga chief suit Javier Tebas, whose apparent desperation to stage Villarreal v Barcelona in the 305 saw him try to ride roughshod over widespread concerns that playing a game abroad of one of the world’s strongest football leagues. It was only when players got involved, carrying out in-game protests which the TV cameras cut away from, that the wheels fell off. Tebas is not giving up, though – the suit was last seen in Riyadh, claiming he “would love” to bring a league match to Saudi Arabia in the future. – can you really be a football manager in this day and age without resorting to artificial intelligence for tactics, post-match quips and triffic little players? Well yes, obviously you can. But nobody told Seattle Reign head coach Laura Harvey, who admitted on the recommendation of ChatGPT. The Reign ultimately fell short in the playoffs but did rise from second-bottom in the NWSL last season to finish fifth. Harvey surely won’t be the last manager to call on AI for a final throw of the dice. You know who you are. Raise your game. The geeks shall inherit the turf. Laptop gurus rule OK. As true football men seek sanctuary amid the blessed realm of podcast “content”, the sport falls ever more into the hands of those picked last in PE. Data boffins have decided long balls and getting it launched are . Set-piece specialists are hailed from the terraces, and fans seek selfies with Austin MacPhee and Nicolas Jover. With off-the-cuff stuff verboten, the game now resembles synchronised swimming, shaved legs included, the crowds asked to get exercised when a long throw is launched into the mixer. Such excitement. Such constipation. As viewers doom-scroll rather than watch actual football, some may suggest the game has been professional for 150 years, and the long throw still never truly caught on, not even in the eras of Ian Hutchinson, Vinnie Jones, Dave Challinor and Rory Delap.

You just had what happened. And what happened was what you had seen happen. Things are different now. If you haven’t lent into optics when discussing your underperforming team, then you’re missing out. One dictionary definition for you: It appears you do want a coach or manager who doesn’t care about optics. But at the same time, optics are important, because it is all we have to work with when results aren’t in your favour. But it’s a fine line between the perception of the event, and the event itself. The other optics – – seems like a posh way of saying what you’re looking at, whether you’re watching England’s top order , Spurs having an xG of 0.000001 or Certainly one way to prove you have no interest in optics is to tweet a Venn diagram when trying to change your WhatsApp profile picture. Not enough Venn diagrams in football, Brian. By all accounts Wilfried Nancy didn’t mean to post two overlapping circles. THINGS THAT MATTER. THINGS YOU CAN CONTROL. A little shaded bit. WHAT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON – and an arrow pointing to the shaded area. The diagram does lead to some existential questions. Does football matter? And does a football manager really have any control over the football match that’s happening in front of him? Perhaps Nancy has been brought to Glasgow to incontrovertibly prove that this thing we invest so much of our time and money in is of no material importance. Like quite a lot of the elite LinkedIn diary of a self-improvement performance movement, when you take away all the bullshit, very little remains. But what if the Venn diagram is right? Take a look at your life, work out what matters, work out what you control, and focus on that. Do I matter? Does this column matter? Do I have control over it? Or does it control me? Does anyone have control over anything? Would Nietzsche play wing-backs against St Mirren? And if we don’t have free will, do I even have the power to focus on the shaded bit in the Venn diagram telling me to get on with this column? One thing missing from almost all of your be-the-best-you Venn diagrams is luck. None of your successful “I’m-really-good-at-life-be-like-me” podcasters ever like to include the incredible amount of fortune anyone needs to succeed. Certainly Nancy hasn’t had a whole lot of luck. Daizen Maeda missed a header my colleague Barry Glendenning would have scored with his eyes closed late on at Tannadice Park. Frankly Celtic could have been well ahead before Dundee United equalised in the second half. He’s unlucky to have followed an absolute legend of the club, and then said he would have stayed on. Nancy has been unlucky. But he has also been not good. A win percentage of zero is testament to that. By all accounts he had a 15-minute handover chat with Martin O’Neill. At least do a free 40-minute Zoom call, Wilfried. Think of the optics. Where does a tiny tactics board sit on your bad optics list? It seems churlish to criticise a manager for using something that might make the top five answers in a Family Fortunes round of “Things a manager might use”. Is tactics board there, Les? Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. Fourth answer! You’ve won a set of garden furniture. But in the memeable age – Ruben Amorim , and now Nancy giving the impression he’s looking for a pickup game of travel Othello. Things that matter. Things you can control. “I think I am in a good direction with the players,” he said after the game at Tannadice. Well, there’s almost nothing you can say post-match that’s going to help. He can’t say he’s in a bad direction with them – despite the evidence suggesting such. As Ewan Murray tweeted post-League Cup final: “A two-minute glance at Celtic’s squad tells you they don’t have guys to play the system Nancy wants. Sticking with that system just because that’s ‘what you do’ isn’t single minded … it is outright daft.” Celtic have had success in the recent past with a “plan A” manager. Nancy should look at the floor and reply “It is what it is, mate” after defeat against Aberdeen on Sunday. The fact remains that 14 days and four games is no time to judge any manager, but if a left-field appointment starts badly it soon becomes just a nonsensical one. Michael Nicholson, Celtic’s chief executive, said Nancy was “our No 1 candidate when we began the process of appointing a new manager”. How did a man who won 14 of 34 games in this year’s MLS regular season surge to the top of Celtic’s list? It may be more complex than this, but Nancy’s longtime assistant is Kwame Ampadu (father of Leeds’s Ethan). Ampadu managed Exeter’s Under-18s when Paul Tisdale was the first-team manager. Tisdale gave Ethan his debut. Tisdale is now Celtic’s head of football operations. Again, none of this matters if the appointment works. It’s good to appoint (good) people you know. And the timing is mad: before playing Hearts, Roma and a cup final. Dundee United, well not so much. Wednesday night was their first win in eight. As a “give the man time” ultra, I hope Nancy proves everyone wrong. And as all those far more well-versed on the situation at Celtic have stated, the problems go way higher than the manager. But in the meantime, if he’s still in the dugout at Celtic Park on Sunday, I hope he unfurls a giant Venn diagram tifo, focuses on the bit he can control that also matters and grinds out a gritty one-nil.",Max Rushden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/15/is-it-true-that-wearing-heels-changes-the-shape-of-your-feet,Is it true that … wearing heels changes the shape of your feet?,2025-12-15T08:00:27.000Z,"Stilettos are fine for an evening out, but wearing them all day, every day could cause permanent damage f you’d asked me that 15 years ago, I would have said: ‘Absolute nonsense – it’s all genetics and shoes aren’t responsible for any problem,’” says Andrew Goldberg, consultant orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist at the Wellington hospital in London. But that show how people’s feet look while standing in their shoes changed his mind completely. He took two scans of a person’s feet – one barefoot and one in high heels – and the difference was striking. In the high heels, the toes were crowded together, the big toe showed a bunion, and the smaller toes were clawed, gripping for balance. “You can imagine that after a few hours your feet ache, and once you take the shoes off, your toes go back to normal,” he says. “But if you wear heels eight hours a day, every day, for years, things start to stick in that position.” Over time, the strain causes stretching of soft tissues, bunions, hammer toes – where the toes remain clawed – and, eventually, wear-and-tear arthritis. All shoes, Goldberg says, influence foot shape to some degree, gradually steering the toes closer together and narrowing the foot profile. Tight or pointed shoes make this worse, and many people wear shoes that are too small for them. If you’re a high-heel wearer, Goldberg recommends doing simple daily foot exercises, such as picking up objects with your toes or walking around barefoot on your tiptoes for a minute, to keep the feet flexible and the muscles strong. Ultimately, he says, moderation is key: “If you wear heels for a dinner party, no problem. But don’t wear them all day, every day. The pain that you get at the end of an evening wearing heels is no wonder, because you’re causing a lot of stress to your poor foot.”",Kate Lloyd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/law/ng-interactive/2025/dec/25/how-donald-trump-killed-international-law,Into the void: how Trump killed international law,2025-12-25T13:00:40.000Z,"The rules-based global order, its institutions and value system face a crisis of legitimacy and credibility as the US turns away ‘The old world is dying,” Antonio Gramsci once wrote. “And the new world struggles to be born.” In such interregnums, the Italian Marxist philosopher suggested, “every act, even the smallest, may acquire decisive weight”. In 2025, western leaders appeared convinced they – and we – were living through one such transitional period, as the world of international relations established after the second world war crashed to a halt. During such eras, Gramsci more famously wrote, “morbid phenomena of the most varied kind come to pass”. And at present there is no more morbid phenomenon than the crisis of legitimacy for the networks of rules and laws on which the international order was based – the world that the US was central in creating in 1945. No one can say they were not warned about the wrecking ball that was about to be inflicted on the global order by The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spelled out with admirable clarity in his Senate confirmation hearing in February how Trump disowned the world his predecessors had made. “The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” he said. “And all this has led us to a moment in which we must now confront the single greatest risk of geopolitical instability and generational global crisis in the lifetime of anyone alive here today.” The rules-based international order had to be jettisoned, Rubio said, because it had been built on a false assumption that a foreign policy serving core national interests could be replaced by one that served the “liberal world order, that all the nations of earth would become members of the democratic western-led community”, with humankind now destined to abandon national identity and become “one human family and citizens of the world. This was not just a fantasy. We now know it was a dangerous delusion”. , with its warnings of European cultural erasure and determination to back nationalist parties that believe in “strategic stability with Russia”. The US would no longer seek to “prop up the entire world order like Atlas”, the document said. On paper these sound like relatively coherent statements of “America first”, but in practice Trump’s foreign policy is a mass of confusion in which this formal non-interventionist ideology has clashed with sporadic interventions that uneasily blend notions of global order with the US national interest. There is no linear Trump foreign policy, just a catherine wheel of disconnected explosions thrown out across the night sky. As Donald Trump Jr asserts, as if it were a virtue, his father is the most unpredictable man in politics. The hugely personal nature of gives Washington’s erstwhile allies just enough false hope that the break with America is not real. Amid this chaos there has been one consistent target for Trump’s contempt: the constraints imposed by international law, and its value system built around national sovereignty, including the prohibition of the use of force to change external borders. In its place Trump pursues “sheer coercive power” – or what has been described as mobster diplomacy, in which shakedowns, blackmail and deal-making are the agents of change. Faced with the choice, for example, between expelling Russia from Ukraine – something the US undoubtedly has the military means to do by arming Kyiv sufficiently – or forging a profitable relationship with Vladimir Putin in which both sides plunder Ukraine’s considerable material resources, Trump unmistakably wants to choose the latter. Ukraine, it emerges, shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, in order to assure the survival and the success of the Trumpian economy. For the EU and Nato this is indeed the moment when every act has the potential to be decisive for the future sovereignty of Europe and the UN charter. – about a fifth of the world’s reserves – becomes, like that of Greenland, Canada and Mexico, the subject of Trump’s marauding eye. Warned on social media that killing Venezuelan civilians without any due process – as the US has done by bombing numerous boats in the Caribbean and Pacific – would be described a war crime, the US vice-president, JD Vance, . The Pentagon has subsequently claimed implausibly that it was permissible in US law to blow up shipwrecked sailors stranded in the water because they were combatants representing a threat to US security. Meanwhile, the rules of free trade are shredded as Trump deploys the sheer size of the US market to extort not just money from allies, but changes in their domestic policy. A country’s standing in the White House is not judged by any rational criteria, let alone its democratic status, but on a leader’s personal relationship to Trump and his ruling clique – a blatantly monarchical order. Finally, Israel’s occupation and bombardment of Gaza, with European powers often complicit bystanders, is brutal in itself but also strips bare the supposed universality of international norms. In the words of Majed al-Ansari, the foreign policy adviser to Qatar’s prime minister and a man who has had more dealings with Israel than most in 2025: “We are living in an age of disgusting impunity that is taking us back hundreds of years. We are reduced to giving concession after concession not to stop acts of aggression, but to ask those responsible to kill fewer people, destroy fewer neighbourhoods. We do not even ask them to have respect for international law, but ask to take a step back from going 100 miles away from international law.” All this has been accompanied by an open assault on the institutions of international law that stand in the way of coercive power. Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the international criminal court, recently gave an interview to Le Monde in which he spelled out the impact of as a result of the ICC’s The sanctions have changed every aspect of his daily life. Guillou explained: “All my accounts with American companies, such as Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal and others, have been closed. For example, I booked a hotel in France through Expedia, and a few hours later, the company sent me an email cancelling the reservation, citing the sanctions.” For having the temerity to uphold the basics of international humanitarian law and the value of the lives of Palestinian civilians at the international court, which deals with issues such as war crimes and genocide, Guillou said he had in effect been sent back to live in the 1990s. European banks, cowed by the threats of US Treasury officials in Washington, rushed to close his accounts. The compliance departments of European companies, acting as the valets of the US authorities, refused to provide him services. Meanwhile, European institutions – even signatories to the Rome statute that established the international court in 2002 – look the other way. Major Palestinian human rights groups such as Al-Haq also find their bank accounts closed as they face sanctions for cooperating with the ICC. The judges at the international court of justice, the UN body that deals with intergovernmental disputes, have had to take evasive action to prevent their assets being seized. The US has left or sought to undermine several other UN bodies, such as the Human Rights Council and Unesco. In total it is estimated to have cut $1bn (£750m) in funding for organisations linked to the UN and fired 1,000 US government staff whose portfolios reinforced major UN functions. At the UN general assembly, the key site of , the US almost relishes its isolation. Other multilateral institutions – the World Trade Organization, the Paris climate agreement structure, the G20 – have become zones of conflict, places where the US can assert its dominance or indifference, either by absenting itself or demanding humiliating fealty from its one-time allies. John Kerry, a former US secretary of state, said that under Trump the US was turning “from leader to denier, delayer and divider”. “When the United States walks away, old excuses find new life. China not only enjoys newfound freedom from scrutiny,” Kerry said: it slowly fills the gap left by the US departure. Washington’s turning away from international law and its institutions is especially sad because, as Dr Tor Krever, an assistant professor of international law at the University of Cambridge, points out, with Gaza “the language of legality has become the dominant frame of popular and political discourse”. In a special edition of the London Review of International Law, more than 40 academics have written essays discussing whether this sudden public faith in international law as a harbinger of justice is a load that the law has the capacity to bear. Law cannot be a substitute for politics or settle ideological conflicts in a polarised world. Prof Gerry Simpson, the chair of public international law at the LSE, said he needed to swallow his longstanding doubts about international law’s efficacy “in the face of the enormous faith that had been placed on it, especially by the young”. The inability to meet new public expectations has led to what Prof Thomas Skouteris, the dean of the law college at the University of Khorfakkan, UAE, describes as “a mood” about international law. Writing in the Leiden Journal of International Law, he argues: “International law’s lexicon – sovereignty, genocide, aggression – has become almost ambient, saturating the political atmosphere with juridical resonance. But ubiquity brings a strange paradox. The more present international law appears, the less decisive it feels. Norms are invoked with greater frequency and intensity even as their capacity to settle disputes or forestall violence seems to weaken. What once promised order increasingly reads as performance.” The paradox is revealed in its starkest form when rulings of the UN security council or the international courts are invoked by western leaders who, in the next breath, prostrate themselves in front of Trump, caving in to his demands, calling him “daddy”, , and sending more lavish gifts to the Sun King and his family. Very few in 2025 stood up against what the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman called “immorality and unseriousness … the two defining traits of our leaders today”. Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN humanitarian agency Ocha, was arguably an exception. In May he asked UN diplomats “to reflect – for a moment – on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza. It is a question we will hear, sometimes incredulous, sometimes furious – but always there – for the rest of our lives … Maybe some will recall that in a transactional world, we had other priorities. Or maybe we will use those empty words: We did all we could.” His was a genuine howl of despair. Another cry of pain came from Oman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi. Speaking to the Muscat retreat of the Oslo Forum, an international mediators’ discussion group, he explained: “We are worryingly close to a world in which certain kinds of foreign intervention – if not outright invasion and annexation of territory – are accepted as a normal part of international relations, rather than as illegal violations of our shared international order. How did this happen?” Al Busaidi claims the problem predated Trump. “Restraint and respect for international law was abandoned in the aftermath of 9/11, with the launch of not one but two foreign interventions, in Iraq and Afghanistan, ostensibly aimed at the elimination of a terrorist threat, but in reality, functioning as explicit projects of regime change.” Now some on the left welcome the idea that international law’s entry into the limelight has coincided with its loss of credibility. The critics would share the view of the Marxist Perry Anderson, writing in New Left Review, that “on any realistic assessment, international law is neither truthfully international nor genuinely law”. They argue that US presidents – Democrat and Republican alike – have always in reality exempted themselves from the law’s constraints. The US has never been a signatory to the Rome statute or the UN convention on the law of the sea. Roosevelt was not that interested in forging a club of democracies, but wanted as much to create a law-based stability pact with Russia. Indeed, Prof John Dugard, a member of the South African legal team at the international court of justice, has argued that the Biden team’s choice of the phrase “rules-based order” was a revealing code because it showed the US ambiguity towards international law. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has long declared that the US is promoting “a west-centric rules-based order as an alternative to international law”. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, made the same criticism in May 2021 during a UN security council debate on multilateralism. “International rules must be based on international law and must be written by all,” he said. “They are not a patent or privilege of a few. They must be applicable to all countries and there should be no room for exceptionalism or double standards.” For much of the global south too, the rules conceal histories of violence and racial hierarchy. Others see international law with its references to proportionality, distinction and necessity as a futile attempt to soften the essential brutality of war. It has been left to an older generation to insist there is something precious worth preserving. Take the response of Christoph Heusgen, the outgoing chair of the Munich Security Conference, in the wake of Vance’s speech attacking European values Heusgen, who served for 12 years as Angela Merkel’s adviser on security and foreign policy affairs, told the conference: “We have to fear that our common value base is not that common any more … It is clear that our rules-based international order is under pressure. It is my strong belief that this more multipolar world needs to be based on a single set of norms and principles, on the UN charter and the universal declaration of human rights. “This order is easy to disrupt. It’s easy to destroy, but it’s much harder to rebuild. So let us stick to these values.” But Ansari, despondent after a year of often fruitless Middle East diplomacy, predicts we are “moving from a world order to disorder”. “I don’t think we are moving towards a multipolar system. I don’t think we are even moving to a power-based international order. I don’t think we are moving towards any kind of system. “We are moving into a system where anybody can do whatever they like, regardless if they are big or small. As long as you have the ability to wreak havoc, you can do it because no one will hold you accountable.” This article was amended on 25 December 2025.

Maggie O’Farrell’s lyrical and immersive novel, which won the Women’s prize in 2020, imagines the relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes Hathaway, and their grief over the death of their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, from the plague in 1596. The book opens with the young Hamnet realising his twin sister Judith is unwell and searching for an adult to attend to her, while unaware that he is the one who is fatally ill. Shakespeare – who is never named and instead referred to as “the husband” or “the father” – is depicted not as a literary superstar but a flawed man who is rarely home. The focus is on Hathaway, a free-spirited woman with deep connections to the landscape. The narrative shifts between her childhood, the early years of her marriage and the aftermath of Hamnet’s death, during which Shakespeare writes one of his greatest plays, Hamlet (records state that the names Hamlet and Hamnet were interchangeable in those days). Jessie Buckley, who plays Agnes in the film, is the book’s narrator for this new recording. Her reading is sensitive, almost dreamlike in places, and alive to the hardships endured by Agnes, who is constricted by domesticity, motherhood and her husband’s ambition. But it is in the portrait of death that both O’Farrell and Buckley truly excel. Hamnet is a profoundly humane account of love, loss and a family undone by grief.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/secrets-body-clock-natural-rhythms-better-day,The secrets of the body clock: how to tune into your natural rhythms – and have a better day,2025-12-26T11:00:08.000Z,"Our circadian cycle doesn’t just affect our sleeping and waking, but our motivations, mood, behaviour and alertness. Whether you are a lark or an owl, here’s how to recognise your own rhythm t’s easy to hate clocks. Their unstoppable forward churn wakes us up and shames us for running late. They are a constant reminder that every enjoyable moment, just like life itself, is ephemeral. But even if we rounded up all our time-telling devices and buried them deep in the earth, we could never escape clocks. Because we are one. We don’t need to have studied the intricacies of circadian rhythms to know that we are ravenous at certain times and not others, that the mid-afternoon slump is real, and if we party until 4am we’re unlikely to sleep for eight hours afterwards, because the body clock has no sympathy for hangovers. But to better understand this all-encompassing daily cycle is to truly know our animal selves. Most of us are awake for 16-17 hours each day, during which we never stop changing, biologically speaking. Every minute, says Debra Skene, a professor in chronobiology at the University of Surrey, “our bodies are different”. She is referring not just to our chemical makeup, bodily functions and energy levels, but also our motivations, behaviour, mood and alertness. “At every point in time, we’ve got rhythms that are either going up or going down. Some are at their peak, some are at their middle point. It’s a dynamic system.” Some of us are early-rising larks and others are midnight-oil-burning owls, because our intrinsic clocks are unique to us. These different chronotypes, as they are known, are normal genetic variations, says Skene. Some people run a little fast, others a little slow; left unchecked, they would slip further ahead or behind. “Over time, you’d be really desynchronised with life on Earth,” she says, “so the role of light and dark is critical to reset your clock to 24 hours each day.” The light-dark cycle “is the strongest, most consistent signal that all animals have evolved to respond to”. This is why we’re becoming increasingly aware of the negative effects of too much artificial light at night: it confuses our systems, just as it does for migrating birds and sea-turtle hatchlings. While we’re all kept more or less in line by the same 24-hour light cycle, our different chronotypes mean some of us prefer to wake up and go to bed earlier or later than others. Skene’s team found that even if a night owl trains their body clock to comfortably run two hours earlier, by strictly adhering to regular waking, bed, breakfast and lunch times, when they stop that training, “they might drift back to being late types”, in accordance with their internal clocks. The circadian clock is designed to ensure survival. To do this, it needs to anticipate what is going to happen. It doesn’t respond to you waking up; it has been secretly preparing your body to wake up an hour or two before it happens. “Your cortisol hormone, which is directly driven by the master clock in your hypothalamus, is beginning to rise, so by the time you wake up, it is nearly at its peak,” says Skene. “And you need the cortisol because it provides a source of glucose, and gives you the courage to get up and face the world.” Any fundamental change in your behaviour as you move through the day, says Robert Lucas, the director of the centre for biological timing at the University of Manchester, “has to involve coordination across lots of different aspects of your body. So let’s say there’s a time of day when you are likely to be hungry and looking forward to a big meal. That’s a motivational change in your brain, but you also need to have a coordinated change in your digestive system and your liver to predict that that food is going to arrive.” It’s your biological clock that keeps track of time and makes sure everything happens when you need it. If you keep chopping and changing your routine, Lucas says: “This coordination can fall apart, and the predictive ability of your body doesn’t work very well. We can experience it to a minor extent even when the clocks change, but definitely with jet lag.” Skene’s team at Surrey found that if you eat at midnight, food won’t be metabolised the same way it would if you ate at midday, resulting in higher levels of triglycerides (fat) circulating in your blood. There’s a whole system of alertness at play, too, and the battle to maintain it becomes harder the longer we’re awake. “Even if you’ve had a good night’s sleep,” says Skene, “you’ve got something counting the hours of being awake, like an hourglass. Your sleep pressure builds up all day.” But with such a long day, we need an extra boost to get us safely through the last part. So late afternoon, or early evening, we experience a secondary peak in energy and cognitive function. “That’s our circadian rhythm in alertness,” says Skene, helping you stay awake until bedtime. If light is regulating our master clocks, surely seasonal swings in daylight hours would change our behaviour? Skene says: “When the dawn and dusk are changing, we’ve got a bit of flexibility in the system. Animals like sheep and deer change their reproductive capacity, skin colour and body weight based on seasons. The big question we are still trying to answer is: how seasonal are humans?” It’s tricky to study, she says, because “we’ve so changed our environment, our body doesn’t know it’s dark winter out there, because we’ve got lights and heating on. So we think we’ve got the capacity to be seasonal, but the way we’ve changed our world now, it’s hard to detect.” The more holistic biologists’ understanding of the body becomes, the more juicy clues to the true complexity of our body clocks emerge. The gut microbiome has its own circadian rhythm, for example. Its daily routines interact with ours as it carries out tasks including helping to digest and extract nutrients after we’ve eaten, and making neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Even our mitochondria, the energy sources within our cells, have their own circadian rhythms, according to researchers at University College London (UCL). , showed that they “kick in really hard early in the mornings”, says Glen Jeffery, a professor of neuroscience at UCL. “They know dawn is coming when we’re still asleep.” That’s when they start generating energy, “so they’re getting you ready. This probably goes back to our evolutionary state – when you wake up early in the morning, you’re really vulnerable. Something could have been watching you during the night. You want to get up and you want to be very functional.” Mitochondria, Jeffery suspects, perform many other crucial bodily tasks we have yet to pin down, but we do know they have a big say in ageing and death, so they’re pretty fundamental. The energy they produce comes in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a chemical present in your cells. ATP is constantly being produced and burned up. “You make your body weight in it every day,” says Jeffery. “It’s a vast process – you do not do anything in this world without ATP.” As ATP starts peaking in the morning, so does our metabolism. “Your metabolism is in a very fast state,” says Jeffery. “You may not feel like it when you crawl out of bed, but it is.” Around midday, the mitochondria start slowing down, producing less energy, and by the evening they are much less active. Jeffery says this is why muscles can ache more after evening exercise. At night, when mitochondria-produced ATP is low, your body can produce ATP energy a second way; but, says Jeffery, it uses “this bad pathway, which is called glycolysis. Glycolysis is terribly inefficient, and when you go for a run late in the day, and you run really hard, and all your muscles hurt, that’s because of glycolysis. Glycolysis is like an old Ford Cortina. It moves, but it produces a lot of crap.” By crap, he means pro-inflammatory substances. Like our circadian rhythms, mitochondrial body clocks are led by sunlight. “They watch light all the time,” says Jeffery, “and what makes them super exciting is they talk to one another. So if I start messing with mitochondria in your toe, by the following morning, mitochondria in the rest of your body know exactly what’s going on.” Jeffery spent his early career in the Arctic, looking specifically at how animals deal with light and darkness. He noticed that when it was dark all day, his colleagues would not only turn on the lights, but they were “very fond of having fires. A fire produces the same wavelength of light as the sun.” “Mitochondria are a battery,” he continues. “You could put an electrode across them and see the charge. When the charge runs down far enough, they signal cell death. And if there’s enough mitochondria signalling cell death, the organism dies.” Sunlight helps charge those batteries. Earlier this year, his team published a paper demonstrating that “if I take you outside in normal sunlight, and I put a spectrometer and a radiometer in your back, and I face you to the sun, I can measure long wavelengths of light coming through your body that are improving your mitochondrial function.” Even on a cloudy day, it may feel as though there isn’t any sunlight. Not so, says Jeffery. In fact, he says: “Those long wavelengths of light that mitochondria need are scattered by the cloud, so it doesn’t matter that it’s a cloudy day. It’s not that significant.” Lucas’s team at Manchester are investigating the importance of daytime light, and whether going outside to maximise it can help counter the confusing effects on our daily bodily rhythms caused by artificial light in the evenings. “There’s an understanding that for these biological clocks it is damaging to be exposed to light in the evening and at night,” he says. “But the other thing that’s happened is, because of electric lighting, we can spend most of our days indoors, and that means we’re also exposed to the natural, very bright daytime light that we would have been exposed to throughout our evolutionary history. Changing daytime light exposure, for most people, is going to be a more tractable thing than changing their evening and night-time light exposure, right?” In other words, it’s harder to persuade people to give up watching TV or using social media in the evening than it is to cajole them into going for a walk outside during the day. It’s all about routine – which, says Lucas, is highly individual, making it hard to generalise about precise biological coordinates throughout the day. “As soon as you say, ‘People sleep best at night,’ there will be somebody who says, ‘Actually, I really like being awake until four.’ There are big inter-individual differences in these things.” He has noticed his own routines change as he has got older. “I’m reliably awake now at six in the morning. When I was 18, I wasn’t. So they definitely are flexible and malleable.” But the universal truth, says Lucas, “is that everybody will experience these rhythmic changes in pretty much every aspect of their body”. And perhaps, to stay better in tune with ourselves, it pays to remember the complex, body-wide changes occurring beyond what we feel at any given moment. “Your lived experience might be feeling sleepy,” says Lucas, “but buried underneath that are a lot of things for your body to get ready. The same goes for when you’re hungry, frisky and all of those things.”",Amy Fleming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These microwaveable glass containers from Anyday will help you waste less food – and cut back on dirty dishes The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. hen I cook for my family, I always pack up leftover food with the best of intentions, and remnants of a weeknight meal generally get eaten within a day or two. Holiday dinners, however, are an entirely different story. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Try as I might to prepare a reasonable spread when I host, I usually end up making or ordering too much of everything. At Christmas, this means I’m often left with more than half of a ham or turkey, a mountain of mashed potatoes and a smattering of other side dishes and desserts. In the past, I would stuff what was left of each item into the biggest air-tight container it required, then cram them all into my fridge, full-well believing my kids and I would live off of those leftovers for the better part of a week. The reality, of course, is that my kids rarely want to eat back-to-back holiday leftovers. And even I have to admit that previously prepared food is never quite as convenient as it seems when I’m staring down a new pile of dishes I dirtied for reheating and serving. I also cringe when I think about how much food went bad in the back of my refrigerator. The good news is that there’s a better and far more sustainable way and it only took me twenty years of writing about food and four years of reviewing products (including storage and organization) for Bon Appétit and Epicurious to figure it out: Putting leftovers into smaller glass containers. This method has rescued my holiday leftovers, and comes in handy the rest of the year too. While food storage containers come in all shapes and sizes, I find a stackable the best format for a few reasons. For starters, it’s easier to make room in the fridge for a handful of smaller containers than a big baking dish or bowl. Dividing loads of holiday leftovers between smaller containers has also helped me cut way back on food waste, because whatever doesn’t get consumed within a day or two can go straight into the freezer. An added bonus? Fewer dirty dishes, because instead of hauling a loosely-covered casserole pan from the fridge and transferring some of its contents to a heat-safe bowl, I can pull a perfectly-portioned serving and pop it right into the microwave or oven. (More on the best microwave-safe and oven-safe storage containers below.) This works whether I’m reheating a side of asparagus for the family or a one-dish dinner of meat, potatoes and broccoli for myself. (And if divvying up leftovers must wait until the morning, you can still create an airtight seal on your serving dishes with Thick, heat-tolerant glass is, by far, the best and most versatile material for storing food because it’s safe to use in the fridge, freezer, microwave, oven and dishwasher. Unlike plastic, you never have to worry about tomato sauce stains or leeching chemicals, and as long as you don’t drop it (or thermal shock it with a sudden and drastic change of temperature) it will theoretically last forever. The only problem is that most – including I used for more than a decade – will outlive their flimsy plastic lids. Earlier this year, I discovered Anyday’s glass food storage containers, and though they seemed a bit gimmicky at first, I quickly realized they’re a game changer for storing and reheating leftovers. After using them for just a few months, I noticed my family was wasting less food – and I was doing fewer dishes. Anyday’s containers are made of thick, durable glass that you can put in the fridge, freezer, microwave, oven and even the air fryer up to 500F. Then you can pop all of the parts into the dishwasher when you’re done. But, unlike other popular glass food storage containers, these are marketed as “cookware and food storage”. The glass lids are cleverly designed for cooking and reheating, with a heat-safe silicone knob that doubles as a vent; just pull it up before microwaving or baking for perfectly-steamed food. I love it for reheating rice, soup and even barbecue sandwiches. A silicone gasket around the rim creates an air-tight seal for the fridge and freezer, and it’s leak-proof enough I feel safe packing soup in it for my five-year-old’s school lunch. (So far, so good!) While I mostly use Anyday’s containers for storing and reheating leftovers, they’re great for quick steam cooking as well as more efficient meal prep. In addition to being a plastic-free alternative for anything that’s supposed to be microwaved in the bag (think: shelf-stable rice and frozen foods), you can use them to cook from start to finish. (Yes, you can !) Lids on some of the larger pieces, like the , are reinforced with a microwave-safe stainless steel rim for extra durability. I certainly wouldn’t want to microwave all of my meals, but the glass containers can be used in the oven to bake and roast anything you’d make in a traditional glass baking dish. So minimalists and cooks short on kitchen space, you can rejoice: an could be a great way to consolidate your food storage and cookware in the new year.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/19/bluetooth-wired-headphones-trend,Move over Bluetooth: wired headphones are back – and suddenly cool again,2025-12-19T16:02:24.000Z,"From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. With white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. For inspiration, there is the Instagram account Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.” But in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.” That symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s , which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones. The pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account , which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?” Price is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor. “We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.” He says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds. Then there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag. La Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.” If wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year. Morgan-Freelander also points to the £20 , a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s. Rodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.” La Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.” This article was amended on 21 December 2025.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/26/knitting-craft-activists-against-trump,‘Weapons of mass construction’: the US ‘craftivists’ using yarn to fight back against Trump,2025-12-26T15:00:12.000Z,"Fiber artists across the US are using their craft to protest against everything from national guard deployments to rollbacks on abortion rights n early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of , Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”. Donald Trump had just ordered national guard troops deployed to the city, which he called “war ravaged” in order to protect ICE facilities he said were “under siege” by anti-fascists “and other domestic terrorists”. Wright wanted to show that life was continuing as normal in Portland, and be a friendly face greeting any immigrants arriving at the ICE facility for appointments. But “I didn’t want to go by myself,” she said. “I wasn’t sure what to expect.” So, she and the other women – who would eventually nickname themselves “Knitters Against Fascism” – brought their knitting needles and lawn chairs, and returned week after week. Word of the “knit-ins” quickly spread by word of mouth and social media: when a friend at her local knitters guild mentioned the protest, knitwear designer Michele Lee Bernstein decided to attend to show that Portland wasn’t “burning to the ground”. “A group of knitters calmly knitting was a perfect visual to counter the lie,” she said. Knowing other crafters would be there “made it easy to participate”. At the second protest she attended, Bernstein designed a hat based on , an inflatable costume that a brigade of protesters wore at similar protests outside the local ICE facility. “Small acts can make big change,” said Bernstein. She posted on her website and a month later learned that a church group had raised $550 for a local food bank by selling hats they had knit with the pattern. Bernstein also sold one of the hats she made herself for $100 and donated the funds to the North-east Emergency Food Program – at a time when need at nationwide food banks was high due to cuts to Snap benefits. “Even if we’re not all down at ICE, we’re working together to do something good,” she said. Wright and Bernstein are part of a centuries-long tradition of fiber artists who have worked toward political goals through their crafts. In 2003, writer Betsy Greer coined the term “craftivism” to describe that particular brand of activism – but knitters, crocheters, sewers, embroiderers and other makers have long used their art to speak out against environmental degradation, racism, wealth inequality, fast fashion and other social issues. From the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who embroidered the white handkerchiefs they wore to protest against the disappearances of their children during Argentina’s military dictatorship, to the Aids Memorial Quilt, which wove together quilt blocks memorializing people lost to Aids, much of the success of those projects has been in the communities they have built. “One of the big challenges in movement building is to build solidarity across different groups of people,” said Hahrie Han, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University and 2025 MacArthur Fellow. “At a certain point in the history of every social movement that has ever changed the world, there’s a point at which the movement gets challenged, or things get hard for whatever reason. And in moments of stress, the motivations that keep people together or that keep movements together are often their social-relational commitments, more than their commitment to the issue.” That is, people are more likely to continue protesting or attending town halls or knitting outside ICE facilities if they don’t want to let down their friends. Shannon Downey discovered the power of craft as a movement building tool more than a decade ago, after a shooting occurred outside her home and a bullet went through her bedroom window. In the aftermath, she realized that even though she was thinking constantly about gun violence, she had no relationship with guns. So she “sat down and stitched a gun” to have time to reflect on what the weapon looked like and what it might be like to hold. An embroidery artist, Downey said her work was initially private and self-reflective. But she later shared it on Instagram and her followers started asking for a pattern so they could embroider their own. Eventually, 2,000 of those followers mailed Downey the guns they had embroidered. At a fundraiser for the Chicago-based non-profit , which works with young victims and perpetrators of gun violence, Downey raised $5,000 by selling the embroidered works. The success of that initial fundraiser inspired her to continue working at the intersection of craft and activism, and start hosting workshops along that theme. There, she realized how quickly strangers bonded around a shared craft. “I just started to see this as, like, the greatest community organizing tool that could exist,” she said. A common example is the “pussyhat”, which many protesters knitted to denounce Trump at the beginning of his first administration. “It was an identity and allegiance signaling tool,” said Downey, “which is one important and very small part of activism.” For some people, knitting a pussyhat or embroidering a feminist statement is the boldest thing they’ve ever done or the most they have ever said publicly about their political beliefs, she said. Last year, Downey published Let’s Move the Needle: An Activism Handbook for Artists, Crafters, Creatives and Makers, a book to help readers think through the question: “What’s the next brave thing that I can do?” For some, that might be joining a social circle around their craft or selling their work to raise funds for a cause. For others it might be picking an issue, targeting its root causes and choosing goals, tactics and a message to bring about a change. “Community building alone is not enough to build a movement,” said Han, the political scientist. A movement must bring “people into community with each other so that they begin to understand the ways in which what they can do together is greater than what they can do alone” and also become a space through which they “realize their interests in the public sphere”. When she hosts workshops, Downey said: “My job is to make sure that you have the best experience ever so that you want to come back again.” That community forms the foundation for whatever comes next. She notes powerful craft communities that have come together without centering politics in their work, such as the Loose End Project, which pairs crafters with families that have lost a loved one to finish the sweaters, quilts, blankets and other projects their family member left behind. “What’s incredible is the people that are completing pieces for people who have lost people” who might not get along outside the project, she said. They might not share the same politics or religion, “but they’re forgetting about all of that, suspending all of that, and connecting through their humanity through this object.” Other craft communities have centered on a political or social aim. The non-profit , for example, invites knitters to make warm clothing for LGBTQ+ youth in New York City’s foster system and homeless shelters. , meanwhile, brought crocheters together in protest with a collaborative mural denouncing the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. And the mother-daughter-owned Danish yarn brand made headlines in August when it raised $828,868 in one weekend for Unicef’s work in Gaza. “While we, as a knitting community, obviously can’t end a war, placing an order on the donation day gave people a way to take action,” said Caroline Larsen, who co-owns Knitting for Olive with her mother, Pernille. The company’s August fundraiser was their seventh since 2020, when they began fundraising for Black Lives Matter in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. “Supporting people in need matters more to us than having an impressive number on our bottom line. Our everyday lives don’t change because of that number, but these donations can make a real difference for someone who needs it far more than we do.” For some fiber artists, craft is inherently political. “Creating in a time of destruction and chaos, that is resistance in and of itself,” said Downey, who adds that, for many, making their own clothing is a powerful rebuke of fast fashion. But she thinks one of the other successes of craftivism is that “it centers joy”. “There’s a lot of anger and rage in the work that I do, that’s the catalyst,” she said.” But you can’t live in that energy.” Creating communities around a shared passion, she believes, makes the work sustainable.",Cecilia Nowell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/25/claudia-winkleman-interview-tess-daly-leaving-strictly-come-dancing,"‘Pure magic!’ Farewell Tess and Claudia, the power couple who were Strictly’s life and soul",2025-12-25T18:45:47.000Z,"The trailblazing female duo’s days of effortlessly holding the BBC dance competition together are over. They open up on the joy of working together or the past 21 years, there has been only one ever-present on . It’s not dancer-turned-judge Anton du Beke, who usually got knocked out of the contest early. It’s not the panel’s panto villain, Craig Revel Horwood, who might be the longest-serving judge but took sick leave after testing positive for Covid in 2021. It’s not even trusty band leader Dave Arch, who didn’t join until series four. No, Strictly’s sole permanent fixture is Tess Daly. She took a few weeks maternity leave in autumn 2004 after giving birth to eldest daughter Phoebe but since then, the glitterball stalwart hasn’t missed a show, clocking up in excess of 500 episodes. It’s an astonishingly resilient record. Daly has been the linchpin of the ballroom behemoth since the very start. And now that she and co-host have stepped down, it is truly the end of a TV era. The pair signed off from live shows with last Saturday’s grand final. Before former footballer Karen Carney and her professional partner Carlos Gu were crowned winners, a surprise video tribute to the departing presenters was played, featuring farewell messages from fans and famous faces including Dame Mary Berry. Revel Horwood read out a heartfelt telegram from “superfan” Queen Camilla, describing the duo as “utterly fab-u-lous” and “perhaps the greatest Strictly partnership of all”. Their send-off concluded with the prerecorded Christmas special, in which goodbyes took a back seat to the festivities. However, both received Christmas gifts from the judges – aptly, a dance for Daly and a comedy skit for Winkleman – before a cathartic last dance where the camera lingered on the duo’s tearful embrace. “It’s our final time,” said Daly. “So let’s make it count. Keep dancing!” With 23 series under her sparkly belt, 56-year-old Daly has been the heartbeat of the hoofing contest. Along the way, she has interviewed 324 pro-celebrity pairings and canvassed the opinion of 13 judges. Throughout it all, she’s held the show together and been a reassuringly familiar presence. Viewers might not appreciate how vital she is until she’s gone. Daly has formed two successful double acts. Alongside Bruce Forsyth, she helped establish Strictly as a primetime hit. It’s hard to imagine now it’s a much-loved autumnal fixture but bringing ballroom dancing back to the TV schedules was a considerable punt for the corporation in the early noughties. Daly was a key part of making the show a success. Her father, textile factory worker Vivian, died of emphysema a year before she landed the Strictly job. “My dad loved ballroom dancing,” she has said. “He got me into it when I was a kid. It’s wonderful to think I’ve done something that would have made him so proud.” When Forsyth hung up his dancing shoes a decade later, Daly formed a trailblazing double act with Winkleman – the first ever female presenting duo on Saturday night TV. It’s testament to Daly’s skill that the show didn’t skip a beat during the transition from Brucey to La Winkle. She went from the old stager’s sidekick to the senior partner but made it look effortless, partly thanks to the women’s off-screen bond. “We’ve been friends for years, forever texting and teasing each other,” Daly has said. “We’re in and out of each other’s dressing rooms, rifling through each other’s clothes rails. I pinch her Haribo while I’m there.” For years, the screensaver on Daly’s phone was a photo of Winkleman after she’d gone too far with the fake tan. Daly said it made her laugh whenever she looked at it. “Tess had to be a bit of a chameleon,” says Strictly’s longtime executive producer Sarah James. “To be a sidekick to Bruce and hold her own with someone so experienced was incredibly impressive. When he left, Tess and Claudia found their groove really quickly. Their different personalities worked well together and they bounced off each other brilliantly. When you think about duos on telly, there’s Ant and Dec – but they’ve known each other since childhood. To form a duo that fast as adults is extraordinary.” Winkleman pays glowing tribute to how Daly helped her settle in. “I was totally terrified,” she recalls. “I’d get so scared before a show, I’d just cling to her. Tess would tell me she had my back and that was how it worked from day one. She wants everyone to feel comfortable, happy and safe. If one of us was ill, worried about our kids or wearing a dress that didn’t feel totally right, we just looked after each other. She’s my life raft and I really hope I’m hers.” The long-fringed fashionista has served an epic stint herself. Winkleman hosted BBC Two companion series Strictly: It Takes Two for six years before being promoted to the Sunday night results show in 2010, then finally the main live show in 2014. She’s been part of the Strictly family for almost as long as Daly. The pair have stood shoulder pad-to-shoulder pad for 15 years. Winkleman is a brilliant broadcaster – smart, spontaneous, free-wheeling and witty. She’s the one who wins Baftas and lands plum gigs elsewhere. She’s made The Traitors another hot BBC property and is reportedly in advanced talks about her own chatshow. By contrast, Daly’s strengths are often underrated. Beneath the slick facade, she’s full of heart and humour. You don’t helm a flagship live franchise for 21 years without being very good at it indeed. “Strictly is one of the last big live shows still running,” says James. “Sometimes we’re on-air for two-and-a-half hours. So much can go wrong. It can’t be underestimated how difficult Tess’s role is. She keeps it all flowing seamlessly. She ensures the judging panel have their say, while keeping on time. On top of that, she’s so warm and supportive with the celebrities. Being a mum and genuine caring soul, she excels at that. She’s also authoritative with the judges, which is no mean feat.” Escapist entertainment isn’t easy to do. “Tess is the absolute anchor of Strictly,” says Winkleman. “We couldn’t do it without her. My part is easy. I have a bunch of brilliant dancers around me on the balcony. Tess has to command the whole floor below and does it with total charm. She drives the show but never, ever makes it about herself. It’s always about our couples.” “What people don’t see on TV is how much goes into contingency planning,” says James. “We practice how to handle it if something goes awry. A lot of that falls to Tess. If a dance goes wrong, or the set or band aren’t ready for the next number to start, it’s generally down to Tess to steer the ship. Thanks to her, viewers wouldn’t be aware that anything has gone wrong. She’s great at responding in the moment. On live TV, anything can happen. Bruno [Tonioli, former judge] might fall off his chair. Someone could swear. You just have to ad lib and keep it moving.” “She constantly saves the day,” adds Winkleman. “She’s extremely calm and a master of live TV. Whatever happens, Tess makes it work. She’s pure magic.” Daly is also a figurehead behind the scenes. “Her investment in the show is the thing that perhaps makes Tess most special,” says James. “She loves and cares about Strictly as much as we all do. I know it’s a cliché but there really is a Strictly family and Tess is the matriarch. She looks after us all, making sure we’re fed, watered and happy. Having had both of her children while working on Strictly, Tess has always been such a champion of working mums, too.” The duo come as a package. Revel Horwood calls them “a power couple”. When they made the shock leaving announcement in October, they did it together on Instagram. They prefer to undertake joint promotional duties, rather than flying solo. Both were recently awarded MBEs for services to broadcasting. With women in the public eye too often pitted against one another by the media, their loyal friendship is a joy to behold. There’s never been a hint of anything but affection between them. This feeds into their on-screen chemistry. “We’ve been through a lot together and I really value our friendship, says Winkleman. “I love her very bones.” Daly gets a rough ride from certain quarters. Venture on to social media during Strictly and alongside catty remarks about the frocks, you might see Daly described as “The Tessbot” or “RoboTess”. Such sniping fails to account for the demands of anchoring a live production with so many moving parts. She’s usually reading the autocue, responding to the voices in her earpiece and reacting to the chaos around her, all at the same time. There’s a whiff of misogyny about much of the criticism. “She’s been at the helm of the longest running entertainment show on the BBC and kept it going for more than 20 years,” says James. “Tess deserves a huge amount of credit.” Crucially, Daly is happy to laugh at herself. Her most embarrassing moment was “Lactating on live television. Luckily I was wearing black, so only I knew.” Since the leaving announcement, demob-happy Daly has visibly relaxed on-screen. She’s relished goofing around with her castmates and is clearly enjoying her well-deserved victory lap. Winkleman might hit more headlines but Daly is the power behind the sequin-spangled throne. As Strictly strives to recover from a string of scandals, the imminent departure of its long-time anchors signals a period of seismic change. Not only does the BBC need to find the right replacements but there are rumours of production being moved to Manchester, although the BBC has denied this. This truly is the end of a choreographic chapter. The semi-final saw them get a surprise send-off. They shed a tear at tribute videos and were given their own commemorative golden glitterball trophies. It felt right to wave them off early. Self-effacing to a fault, the duo wouldn’t want to steal the spotlight from the finalists. The sight of Tess Daly beneath the Strictly glitterball has been a constant in our living rooms for more than two decades. Expect an emotional end. “We will cry and eat pizza and might have a drink,” says Winkleman. “But mainly we will laugh about how lucky we are to have been part of the amazing Strictly snowglobe. We’re going to miss it so much but will never lose touch. Tess is my friend for life. We both fully support whoever takes over. I can’t wait to applaud from my sofa with a massive bag of crisps.”",Michael Hogan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/23/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-the-least-bad-terminator-game-in-a-long-while,Terminator 2D: No Fate review – the least bad Terminator game in a long while,2025-12-23T10:00:54.000Z,"Arcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines ike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years. So it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film. Terminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals. The momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows. No Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe. T2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices. While No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.

So she put her feelings on camera. The answer was immediate ... f you’re a woman of a certain age with a phone, you’ve probably seen one of Melani Sanders’ . In a fleecy dressing gown with reading glasses hanging off her like Christmas tree baubles, a sleep mask wonkily on her forehead, Sanders stares deadpan at the camera. “We are putting the world on notice that we simply do not care much any more,” she says. She uncaps a highlighter with her teeth, spitting the lid out of shot, then starts flatly listing stuff members of the We Do Not Care Club, her virtual community of menopausal women, don’t care about. “We do not care we have to go to therapy weekly; you are probably the reason we are there.” “We do not care if we asked you the question 13 times. We do not remember the answer; say it again.” “We do not care if you realise we are not wearing a bra: this, my friend, is freedom.” Sanders laughs when I show her over Zoom (she’s in West Palm Beach, Florida) the highlighter tucked into my bra strap in her honour. Since she starting a “we do not care club” on 13 May 2025, it has become more than a series of brilliantly funny videos about how the midlife hormonal rollercoaster leaves women bereft of fucks to give. It is a worldwide sisterhood of 2.2 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on TikTok. But when Sanders, 45, sat frazzled and sleep-deprived in her car, fetching the supplements that kept her (somewhat) sane since entering surgically induced perimenopause, she was wondering if she was alone. Pre-hysterectomy, she was a perfectionist, running her home, family and life with military precision; no more. Her sports bra was skew-whiff; her hair dishevelled. “I said: ‘Melani, you really just don’t care any more … Is it just a me thing? I just hit record.’” Twenty minutes after what she calls her “hot mess moment”, she had her answer: it wasn’t just a her thing. Sanders was a seasoned content creator – “I’ve had viral content; I know what that looks like” – but this was different: her post was everywhere, all at once. “I honestly got scared,” she says. “I actually cut my phone off for a little while.” She turned it back on to post again the next day – already in her signature list format (“We don’t care about being on time – baby, be happy I showed up because I don’t even want to be here,” was one highly relatable item). Thereafter, whenever she looked at her phone, hundreds of thousands more women who found her hilarious, but who also finally felt seen and understood, had joined the club. It was overwhelming, she says. “I cried a lot during this time – impostor syndrome. I did not think I was enough. I felt everyone was looking at me to continue this, but I’m in perimenopause, I don’t know what I’m doing from day to day. I don’t even know who I am from day to day!” What shifted, Sanders says, was seeing other women saying they were starting their own “chapters” of WDNC, taking on the mantle of not caring in their own areas, or communities. “I said thank you, Jesus – this is a sisterhood.” Still, Sanders remains WDNC’s beating heart, and it has been an intense ride for a woman dealing with a grab-bag of perimenopause symptoms and a full life with a husband and three sons. There’s been an appearance on with Halle Berry; Ashley Judd filmed a ; Sanders regularly receives deeply heartfelt messages from women going through the menopausal wringer. She has even written a book, the imminent (and extremely funny) The Official We Do Not Care Club Handbook. “What got me to the point of just embracing it is hearing women saying: ‘I feel seen now. You’re saying the things we want to say.’ That is what strengthens me.” Perimenopause can be, as Sanders says, “extremely isolating”. Women’s symptoms are minimised; misinformation – and medical indifference – is rife. Feeling part of a community, sharing frustrations and symptoms (“I have a saying, if our sister’s coochie is dry, then we all have dry coochie,” Sanders says, winningly) and, above all, having a laugh, is precious. Her pinch me moment, Sanders says, wasn’t the celebrity stuff, but when a woman spotted her shopping for groceries: “She started to cry and she said I’ve been following you – I’m going through a divorce right now, I’m in perimenopause and, watching your videos, you’ve given me the strength to keep pushing through.” Because she does care, hugely – not about laundry or chin hair, but about the stuff that really matters. The Official We Do Not Care Club Handbook by Melani Sanders will be published on 13 January by HQ (£12.99).",Emma Beddington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/15/why-food-poisoning-how-to-avoid-oysters-raw-meat,"‘Oysters are a risk, as is raw meat’: why you get food poisoning – and how to avoid it",2025-12-15T10:00:27.000Z,"Several kinds of bacteria can give you an upset stomach. Here is how to steer clear of the worst offenders, and what to do if they do make it through any people in the modern world, it’s probably fair to say, do not take food poisoning particularly seriously. Yes, most folks wash their hands after handling raw chicken and use different chopping boards for beef and green beans – but who among us can honestly say we’ve never used the same tongs for an entire barbecue or left a storage box of cooked rice on the sideboard for a couple of hours? Ignore that rhetorical question for a moment, though – before you comment that everyone should do all those things, let’s talk about what’s happening in your body when it all goes horribly wrong. At the risk of stating the obvious, food poisoning occurs when you eat food contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses or toxins – but that doesn’t mean it always works the same way. “Some bacteria, such as – sometimes found in reheated rice – produce toxins before the food is eaten, meaning they can cause symptoms such as sudden vomiting within hours,” says Dr Masarat Jilani, an NHS specialist who regularly manages children and adults with food poisoning. also produces another type of toxin in the small intestine, which can cause diarrhoea. “Others, such as , act after you’ve eaten and often cause longer-lasting symptoms through inflammation of the gut.” Technically speaking, then, an expert might be able to guess what type of bacteria or virus you have ingested based on how quickly you become ill after eating. But in practical terms, that rarely happens. “All of these bacteria work in different ways,” says Dr Emma Doughty, an infectious disease scientist. “ bacteria, which you often find in poultry, are spiral-shaped and corkscrew their way through your gut lining. That’s different from, say, Shigatoxigenic , which excretes Shiga toxins. Both make you sick with gut inflammation and diarrhoea.” This means that, even though there are some effective treatments for food poisoning, such as antibiotics, it is not always easy for doctors to know which to prescribe. “If you’ve got a stomach bug and you go to the doctor, typically they’re not going to give you antibiotics,” says Doughty. “The reason for that is that if you’ve got the Shiga toxin-producing variant of , and if you then kill all those bugs with antibiotics, they’re just going to release all the toxins inside them and make you even more sick. So without a specific infection diagnosis, it’s quite often safer to just let things get better on their own.” What should you be doing to avoid all this unpleasantness? “Some of the most classic advice is still relevant,” says Doughty. “Oysters are always a risk, as is eating any kind of raw meat – there’s been a vogue for people to eat medium-rare burgers recently, which is a bit troubling.” To explain: if you are about to eat beef, you need to sear the parts that have been exposed to air to kill most of the bacteria likely to be living on it. With steak, that just means the outside, but with mince, that’s almost all of it. – is an absolute no-no, as it’s likely to spread bacteria all over your kitchen and utensils, rather than reducing your chance of infection. Obviously, you should be keeping things clean, keeping raw meat separate from other food, quickly cooling cooked food and refrigerating it within two hours of cooking, and ensuring food is properly cooked, perhaps using a meat thermometer. “As with a lot of other infections, washing your hands is really valuable to prevent getting sick,” says Doughty. “In this case, it means washing your hands thoroughly after handling food, and after using the toilet.” If it all goes wrong, most people won’t have too much to worry about, assuming they aren’t in an at-risk population. “The main risk from food poisoning is dehydration, which is why it is important to drink plenty of water and supplement with oral rehydration salts when you are experiencing it,” says Jilani. “Reintroducing a balanced diet is also important for recovery, and in the initial stages we often recommend a Brat diet – bananas, rice, stewed apple, and toast – if you feel that you can’t reintroduce your normal one straight away.” In more extreme cases food poisoning can lead to sepsis, which can include symptoms such as a fast heart rate and light-headedness. If you feel this might be happening, call the GP straight away. “In a minority of cases, you might also develop post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can be characterised by abdominal pain and bloating,” says Jilani. Again, see a doctor if it persists. The good news is that most cases of food poisoning will clear up on their own in a few days, as your immune system sorts them out. Just be more careful with the tongs next time.",Joel Snape,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/23/how-to-start-hosting-parties,‘More complicated than it needs to be’: how to start hosting parties,2025-12-23T17:00:47.000Z,"Worried about cost, planning – or whether anyone will show up? We asked experts how to bring back parties Several months ago, staring down another empty weekend, a friend texted me. “Why is no one having parties?” she fumed. Some people were, we agreed, but not nearly enough. Indeed, in January, the Atlantic’s Ellen Cushing “America is in a party deficit”, quoting a 2023 Bureau of Labor Statistics report that found only 4.1% of Americans attended or hosted a social event on an average holiday weekend. That figure was down a whopping 35% since 2004. . I conducted an informal survey (texting my friends) and at least one thing was clear: hosting . Some said it was too much work or too expensive. Others were worried no one would show up. “Hosting has become more complicated than it needs to be,” says Marina Birch, principal event architect at Birch Design Studio. The extravagant, artfully decorated events you see on Instagram look great, but a party doesn’t have to be so elaborate, aesthetic or expensive. “Hosting is really just about gathering people and making them feel comfortable,” Birch says. “When the focus shifts to how it looks instead of how it feels, it can feel overwhelming.” Below, experts share what you need to know to start hosting parties. Begin with the scale of your party and the guest list. Is this an intimate dinner for your closest friends? Or a larger, rowdier gathering for a bigger group? Start with whatever makes you feel the most at ease, says Rachael Glaws, principal and creative director of RGI Events. “If it is your first foray into hosting a party, do it in a location where you’re going to feel comfortable, and with people you’re going to feel comfortable in front of,” she says. Once that’s settled, move on to logistics. Renee Patrone Rhinehart, CEO and founder of Events by Renee and Party Host Helpers, says essential details include: Daytime or night-time? How long will it last? Will there be food? If so, does that mean a sit-down dinner, only appetizers or a buffet? Will you have caterers? “Less is more when it comes to food,” Rhinehart says. “Keeping the menu simple yet delicious goes a long way.” If serving alcohol, which kinds? Which non-alcoholic beverages will you have available? Don’t skimp on ice, says Rhinehart: “You can never have enough!” Are they invited, or is it an adults-only affair? “Hosting well doesn’t have to mean spending a lot,” says Birch. She suggests focusing on a few things done thoughtfully. “Simple food that you love, candlelight, good music and a welcoming atmosphere can carry an entire evening,” she says. Good lighting is an affordable, often overlooked detail, Glaws agrees. Candlelight makes everyone look their best, she says: “They can totally transform a quick cocktail hour and make it feel polished, sophisticated, sexy and chic.” Limiting the bar is another easy way to save money. “If you’re trying to watch dollars, offer just beer and wine rather than liquor,” Glaws says. She usually offers two types of white wine and two types of red wine, so guests have options. Give guests plenty of notice. Rhinehart suggests sending out invitations six weeks in advance, and sending periodic reminders. How you write your invitation also matters, says Birch. “When an invitation feels warm and intentional, guests sense that they’re truly wanted,” she says. “Be clear, be confident and invite people into a feeling rather than an event.” If it seems like a lot of people are bailing, expand your pool of guests, Rhinehart says: “Keep a B-list so if a lot of people cannot make it, you can extend your invitations to others.” Don’t try to do too much, says Glaws: “We’re not all Martha Stewart.” If you prefer decorating to cooking, for example, focus your energy on tablescaping and pick up prepared dishes to serve. “If you try to do everything, you’re going to end up with a burnt turkey, flowers that don’t make it to the table and something on fire in the kitchen, and you won’t have any fun,” she says. Making sure you have fun goes a long way to making sure your guests have fun. “Guests relax when the host does,” says Birch. Finally, while it’s good to have a plan of attack, don’t make an event too rigid, says Glaws. “Guests appreciate having time to arrive, settle in and connect naturally,” she says. “Letting things unfold a bit on their own often creates a more relaxed and enjoyable evening.”",Madeleine Aggeler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/26/gaza-trapped-maze-peace-deaths-ceasefire-palestinians,"In Gaza we’re trapped in an endless maze of waiting – for peace, for the deaths to stop and for our lives to begin again",2025-12-26T12:00:09.000Z,"A ceasefire was announced on 10 October. But despite ‘peace’ being on the lips of world leaders ever since, we Palestinians are still under siege and afraid we hear the word “peace” constantly – even more often than we hear the roar of warplanes or the thuds of shelling. It appears on television screens, in the statements of world leaders, in promises repeated again and again. Every country claims to want peace for Palestinians. Yet have we ever lived it for a single day? The truth is that we have not. We are now living under a ceasefire, or at least that is what the US and the rest of the world have been telling us. But in Gaza, we haven’t felt it at all. It was amid great celebrations in Sharm el-Sheikh. Since then, Israeli forces have killed , including about 70 children, in Gaza. Because of the explosions I keep hearing, I am still afraid to leave the house. We are trapped in an endless maze of waiting: for the suffering to stop, for our lives to begin again and above all, for the While the world’s leaders discuss the “day after” and finalise their peace plans, proposing and deciding our fate, we remain in the depths of the unknown, drowning in the fear and confusion war has caused. My family and I are now renting a small, unsuitable apartment. Daily life is extremely difficult. Access to water is limited, cash is hard to obtain with no working ATMs and the streets are so badly destroyed that walking or driving feels dangerous. There is no electricity or reliable internet, and no sense of stability or safety. I see families living in destroyed homes, with buildings above them at constant risk of collapse. They have no choice. All they want is a roof over their heads, even if it could fall at any second. And since it is December, with no homes left for us and our life confined to tents, some of us are literally submerged in winter water, in mud, in every sense of the word. Along the newly created borders of Gaza, where Israel has taken even more of our land and homes, is a new invisible boundary they call the “ ”. On the east side of the line, houses are demolished every day, and people cannot sleep because of the intensity of the explosions and the smell of smoke. We hear stories that children are shot if they come the line that no one can see. At the start of December I visited relatives in Gaza City whose home is still standing, near the so-called yellow line. The house constantly shakes from artillery fire and what we call explosive robots – ground-based, remotely operated devices loaded with large amounts of explosivesthat are capable of destroying entire residential blocks. They keep the windows closed most of the time because of the smoke from nearby attacks, which they fear may come from We dream of having the peace and security that are rightfully ours, but that now seems to exist only in a fantasy. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, countries discuss giving it to us as if it were forbidden, as if we were not entitled to it. We long for the simple realities of safety: a home that won’t be destroyed, lovers who might meet again, dreams that could come true, nights without fear. Things most people elsewhere take for granted. When I heard about the “ceasefire” in October, I felt happy and hopeful, believing it would mark the end of the war and the beginning of a new life filled with safety and peace. Yet here I am at the end of December, still waiting for any real change. While the terms of the ceasefire are delayed on the ground, tears are shed at night. I wait to see my fiance, my love, whom I have not seen for two full years because it has been too dangerous to move between the central Gaza Strip, where I lived, and the southern part, where he lived. He travelled to Egypt in April 2024 – and now he cannot enter again and I cannot leave. Like so many other things in this war, our hope has been delayed. I must wait longer to be with the person I love, in peace. This is the true torment of a Palestinian: waiting for the unknown and trying to hold on to hope. Sometimes it feels worse than death. Benjamin Netanyahu said this month that the . Unfortunately for Palestinians, none of it has translated into reality yet, and we remain excluded from the very negotiations that speak about our future without us. The beautiful Gaza we dream of returning to has gone. We look out and see rubble and suffering instead. The world and its constant meetings about our future have produced nothing that we can feel or touch. We try to create a form of peace for ourselves, even if it is fragile or false. We hold on to hope, even when it feels thin, and search for brief moments of happiness to survive the deadly waiting. We try to rebuild a life out of ashes because, as the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish wrote: “We carry hope like an illness, and we feel everything deeply.” In the end, this hope is all we have to keep going, while the world debates peace from afar.

https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/26/stranger-things-season-five-vol-2-review,Stranger Things season five vol 2 review – the fact that this isn’t unbearable is a miracle,2025-12-26T01:00:54.000Z,"Yes, the kids are now 90% Adam’s apple. Yes, Winona Ryder has been unforgivably sidelined. And yes, some characters are trapped in a room filling with yoghurt. But despite our misgivings, this show still absolutely slaps isten, this isn’t the place for newcomers. has been around for almost a decade, and it has spent almost all this time building a mythology that has grown so unwieldy that trying to explain it would cost me my wordcount and my will to live. However, in fairness, this new penultimate batch of episodes gives it a good try. The content of these new episodes can neatly be split into three categories. There’s action, which is high-octane and fun, and probably why you’re watching. Then there’s dialogue, which is less successful because it causes characters to stop moving and emote at each other, even though they should probably be concentrating on the imminent end of the world. And then there is explanation, of which there is a ton. You will remember that Stranger Things was initially conceived as a one-off, and its success forced the Duffer Brothers to cake on endless new lore to keep the engine running. Well, things have become so convoluted that maybe 40% of the show is taken up with people reminding other people what the hell is going on. The second episode of this new batch is so incomprehensible that Maya Hawke has to stop everything so that she can very slowly explain the plot, using props, as if talking to children. It doesn’t exactly scream entertainment. And yet more lore is caked on by the second. The thrust of these episodes is that the Upside Down (the evil parallel dimension at the heart of the show) isn’t actually a parallel dimension. It is in fact a wormhole to an even worse dimension, and Vecna (who remains a winning cross between the Grinch and an unbroadcastable outtake from a colon cleanse commercial) is trying to collapse it so he can take over the world. And our young – well, youngish, since the male cast is now 90% Adam’s apple – heroes have to stop him. Some of them are in the real world. Some are in the Upside Down. Some are in a secret memory world hidden inside the Upside Down. For some reason, two of them are trapped in a room that’s slowly filling up with yoghurt. No, really. So the fact that none of this is unbearable is miraculous. Stranger Things is one of those shows that, when it gets everything rolling in the right direction, absolutely slaps. It’s a grand, pedal-to-the-metal spectacle where everything is maxed out to the nth degree. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed. The nostalgia remains extremely effective. The emotion rarely drops below operatic. On a second-by-second basis, Stranger Things is amazing. The downfall of season five’s release strategy, though, is that it gives you time between episodes to think. We had a month to sit with the last batch, and a week until the finale, and the moment you apply any level of reason to the show, the entire thing falls apart. You notice that almost every character becomes significantly more or less intelligent at any given moment, based on the demands of the plot. You start counting all the characters, and realise that more than half of them are dramatically superfluous. You realise how old and tired the children look, and that the sidelining of Winona Ryder is unforgivable. Usually at this late stage of a landmark drama series, things winnow down. Unnecessary characters and extraneous plot points are shed so that the finale can deliver with maximum power. Look at Breaking Bad, which cut everything away so that the final episode could focus on Walter White settling his last scores. Look at The Sopranos, which systematically killed off characters to prepare us for Tony’s fate in the finale. Even Mad Men dropped its ad industry sheen to concentrate on Don Draper’s personal collapse and rehabilitation. But not Stranger Things. As things stand, the finale has a mountain of admin to battle through. Vecna needs to be defeated. Children need to be rescued. The world needs to be saved. The evil scientists – who started all this, remember – need to be stopped. And then, when all that is done, it somehow needs to find believable and distinct emotional denouements for (if I’ve counted correctly) 17 characters. There is so much work to do in such a short space of time it’s unfathomable how the Duffers can wrap a satisfying bow around such a sprawling mass. Then again, stranger things have happened. Let’s talk again next week.

https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/19/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy,Are sweet potatoes healthy?,2025-12-19T17:00:06.000Z,"This holiday staple is also one of the world’s oldest crops – here’s what to know about adding sweet potatoes to your diet Sweet potatoes can be roasted, mashed, fried and pied – you might have eaten them so often that they feel old hat. In a way, they are – sweet potatoes count among the world’s oldest domesticated crops. Archeological evidence suggests they were cultivated in South America “more than 4,500 years ago”, says Michelle Johnson, a seed historian, journalist and self-described “sweet potato superfan”. Flavorful, productive, resilient and adaptable to a wide range of climates, the entire plant is edible, and has thousands of cultivars; about 20 are sold commercially in the US, says Johnson. Surprisingly, they are kin to morning glories but unrelated to either white potatoes or yams. Their health bona fides, however, are clear. Here’s what to know about adding more sweet potatoes to your diet. A medium orange sweet potato (about 140g, or one serving, cooked) contains about 130 calories, 30g of carbohydrates and 2g of protein. Most of the carbs come from complex starches, or slow-digesting chains of glucose molecules; less than half derive from their approximately 10g of simple sugar. How you prepare a sweet potato can affect sugar content and glycemic index, or the speed at which a food causes blood sugar to rise. Steamed or boiled sweet potatoes retain most of their resistant starch, making them a food, while roasting sweet potatoes at high heat converts more of their starch into a sugar called maltose, giving them a higher glycemic index. Despite their sugar content, sweet potatoes are still a healthy carb option for people with diabetes, says Asako Miyashita, a New York-based registered dietitian with a special focus on Japanese dietetics. That’s largely due to their high fiber content – about 4-6g per serving. Their fiber content “helps stabilize your blood sugar, as well as lower your cholesterol and increase satiety”, says Miyashita. She advises clients to eat sweet potatoes skin-on for maximum fiber and, if diabetic, stick to servings of about half a cup paired with green vegetables and protein for ideal blood sugar balance. Cooking sweet potatoes, then cooling them and eating them later allows for the development of even more resistant starch, which behaves like fiber and helps prevent blood sugar spikes. supports good gut bacteria and helps keep you regular, but sweet potatoes offer another digestive benefit, too. Cut a raw one open and you’ll see white sap oozing out. “That contains a compound called yarapin,” Miyashita says. Yarapin aids digestion by supporting peristalsis – the muscle contractions that move food through your digestive tract. Sweet potatoes’ micronutrient density sets them apart from other staple starches such as white potatoes, wheat and rice. A medium sweet potato will give you some manganese, iron, vitamins C and B6, and calcium, plus 12% of your daily potassium and 34% of your daily copper needs. “Copper benefits skin, it protects against oxidative stress, and it’s important for the brain and nervous system as well,” says Sharniquia White, a North Carolina-based chef and registered dietitian. A examining the effects of dietary copper on cognitive function found people with a high copper intake performed better on cognitive function tests. Orange varieties, like jewels or Beauregards, carry significant amounts of beta-carotene. The body processes beta-carotene into vitamin A which is good for our . “It’s also really great for immune function,” says White. Beta-carotene is fat-soluble, so pairing sweet potatoes with fatty ingredients such as olive oil or, as Miyashita prefers, sesame seeds can help with absorption. Purple sweet potatoes, such as the Japanese Okinawa variety, are high in anthocyanins – antioxidants that researchers measuring antioxidant strength found purple sweet potato anthocyanins outperformed those from red cabbage, grapes and elderberries in fighting free radicals that contribute to cell damage. While more studies are needed, purple sweet potatoes offer “promising antitumor properties,” researchers have White sweet potatoes, such as the Hannah variety, may boast fewer antioxidants than their colorful counterparts but still offer some beta-carotene and more micronutrients and fiber than white potatoes such as Idahos or russets. Even so, the takeaway isn’t to completely abandon white potatoes for sweet: “There’s a place for both” in a balanced diet, says White. White recommends selecting firm sweet potatoes with smooth, even skin and no smell. A sweet scent may mean the sugars are breaking down and your tuber is going bad, she says. Store them in a cool, dry place. Sweet potatoes are popular, but people often underestimate just how much can be done with them. Lately, White has been blending cooked sweet potatoes into smoothies and adding them to chai lattes as a kind of pumpkin spice analog. She also scores thick slices of sweet potato and grills them like steak, or roasts them until cooked but firm, to use as a base for avocado “toast”. A teacher recently sparked a TikTok trend by her favorite way to eat a sweet potato: baked whole and stuffed with a baton of cheese. “You can have them savory, you can have them sweet, you can have them for a snack, you can have them for entree,” says White. “Not only are they nutritious – they’re also very versatile.”",Adrienne Matei,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As director of the (FCDS), he has spent years mapping the transformation of this fragile landscape from the air. His team has logged more than 150 overflights, covering 30,000 miles (50,000km) to track deforestation advancing along the roads, illicit crops and the shifting frontiers of human settlement. “We now have the highest road density in the entire Amazon,” says Botero. Yet the infrastructure he describes is not necessarily a sign of progress or social development, but mostly a network of illegal routes expanding in southern across the Amazon forest, which covers . Since 2018, various armed groups have built more than there, spreading like arteries through the jungle. The layout of this new network almost exclusively benefits organised criminals, who control the vast region and use the roads to export illicit goods, which also add to the environmental devastation. , there is demand for cocaine, gold and meat; the Amazon supplies that demand. In our environmental deterioration, there is an international shared responsibility,” says Botero. , the FCDS says the north-western region of the Amazon – which has 17 illegal groups operating in nearly 70% of its municipalities – has The report states: “It is a problem of macro-criminality that connects armed groups, gangs and cartels with political intermediaries and business conglomerates that, in addition to taking over natural resources and destroying ecosystems, seek to exercise territorial and population control over the region.” , also notes shifts among the factions operating in the country. “The distinction between insurgent actors and organised crime groups has become increasingly blurred,” in a report. “The structures have shifted from hierarchical models, such as the major drug cartels of the 1980s and 1990s, to more federated organisations with dynamic interactions that have formed a complex criminal network.” This degradation intensified after the 2016 signed between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which used the jungle as a hideout and protected it for strategic convenience. New groups emerged, often with more local than national ambitions and in conflict with each other. The current list, in addition to the old National Liberation Army (ELN), includes the Gaitanistas (also known as the Gulf Clan, Urabeños, and Gaitanist Self-Defence Forces of Colombia, or AGC), Central General Staff (EMC), General Staff of Blocks and Front (EMBF), Second Marquetalia and Border Command (CDF), among others. “When the peace was signed, several Farc dissidents announced they would not surrender their weapons, and immediately an increase in deforestation became evident: 150,000 hectares [370,000 acres] in 2018,” says Botero. Now , Colombia lost about 56,000 sq km (21,000 sq miles) of total tree cover and about 21,000 sq km of primary rainforest between 2001 and 2024. A large portion of that land, in the north-western Amazonian arc, is now used for cattle, whose numbers have also increased – doubling from 1,600,000 to 3,200,000 in the last eight years. Several experts attribute the current crisis to the missteps of the leftist president Gustavo Petro, a leader who long torn apart by civil war, and to protect the environment. His critics argue that Petro was unable over remote areas of Colombian territory or prevent the withdrawal of the Farc leading to the emergence of splinter guerrilla groups and new criminal cartels that now dominate the cocaine market. Kyle Johnson, a researcher at the Bogotá-based (Core), says it is not just a failure of this administration. “The figures show that the last two governments had very different approaches to the problem, and neither worked. The lack of implementation of the peace agreement is the main cause behind the growth of armed groups in the Amazon.” promised comprehensive rural reform, including an agrarian development plan and access to land for farmers. It also proposed a strategy to sustainably replace illicit crops such as coca. In its promise to democratise access to land in Colombia, the Petro government to farmers. Still, inequality persists: the , according to the Agustín Codazzi Geographic Institute, Colombia’s state cartographical agency. ”, Petro’s ambitious initiative to disarm all groups across the country, would have fared better if it had focused on fulfilling the peace agreement with the Farc. “That agreement has tools to advance peacebuilding, and by applying it, the government sends a message to the new groups. They may think that if the government doesn’t implement the previous agreement, there’s no guarantee it will do so with the new ones,” Johnson says. He says the breach of the armistice with the Farc is the main argument used by emerging groups to remain armed. They also denounce of ex-combatants of that guerrilla group. But the underlying reason is that the Amazon holds vast resources for the factions that exploit it. Along the rivers and deep in the jungle, in hard-to-reach areas dominated by armed groups, everyone must pay tribute to these de facto powers: merchants, transporters, cattle ranchers, farmers and anyone in commercial activities. Some groups have conducted detailed censuses in the areas they control and know how each hectare is used so they can profit from those activities – and threaten those who resist extortion. , a programme that seeks to turn deforestation hotspots into areas with environmental market potential. But the institutional response remains insufficient. In many areas of the Colombian Amazon, armed men prohibit officials from the environment ministry and the Codazzi Geographic Institute from entering. This limits the information the government can obtain from disputed territories and hinders the implementation of public policies aimed at their inhabitants. Sebastián Gómez, an adviser to the country’s Peace Agreement Implementation Unit, acknowledges failures in the approach. “From the start, the government insisted that coca-growing families eradicate their crops without offering them alternatives. And soon they replanted,” he admits. In 2017, several Amazon regions experienced a crisis in the coca economy. According to Gómez, this allowed the entry of international criminal networks from Mexico and Europe, fostering new illicit economies such as extensive cattle ranching and mining – two major drivers of deforestation and river pollution. Increasing amounts of cocaine, meat, timber, gold and other valuable minerals such as coltan are exported along the jungle’s illegal roads. For Gómez, the solution to this expanding illegal market is complex, and goes beyond military intervention. “More than a punitive approach, what is needed is one that transforms local economies. We have to build a special agricultural economic proposal for this region, one compatible with forest preservation,” he says. For millennia, Indigenous communities in the Amazon survived in the jungle and benefited from it – a balance disrupted by the large-scale arrival of settlers seeking profit. A study published by the Rio de Janeiro-based Igarapé Institute and the Amazon Investor Coalition confirms that the rising demand for commodities in the Amazon. The report recommends joint action by the governments of the nine countries that share the territory to “strengthen territorial governance, empower local communities and align political ambition”. Land ownership is central to the problem. The exploitation of timber, cattle, coca and minerals generates a steady cashflow for criminal cartels, which they use to expand their operations by recruiting more people and weaponry. But in the longer term, wealth lies in owning land. “Bringing all those deforested hectares into the market means the land gains value with cattle, water and power lines. Ultimately, the state finances a speculative land market. That’s the backdrop: land is the big business,” says Botero. Johnson remains pessimistic. “In the short term, there is no solution. The state must offer those men options other than money – ones that are attractive enough to encourage demobilisation. “We must identify other incentives: family, peace of mind, the desire to retire and the desire to see their children,” he suggests. “They are criminals, but they are also people. In the Colombian Amazon, we must blend the environment with peace.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/i-see-music-in-colour-chromesthesia-sound-to-color-synaesthesia,The way I feel: I see music in colours as I play – it’s almost psychedelic,2025-12-26T14:00:12.000Z,"Celia Craig, an oboist and record-label founder, shares her experience of chromesthesia can remember the first moment I realised I had synaesthesia, a brain phenomenon experienced by 2% to 4% of the population, in which stimulation of one sense leads to automatic experiences in a second sense. I was three years old and somebody played the B note on the piano. The whole room went white, like a blizzard. I remember thinking: “Wow, B feels good, doesn’t it?” Back then I didn’t know there was a word for my experiences; I just knew I loved to be around music because of the thrill it gave me. Each note looked like a certain colour, becoming more sophisticated and textured as I grew up. Listening to pieces of music became an almost psychedelic experience. Some would give me an emerald green effect or feel like I was in the warp drive in Star Trek. Others would trigger this feeling of floating in billowing waves of purple. It was exhilarating but overwhelming. I remember listening to an opera and thinking: “God, you can hardly see in pieces like this.” I still thought everybody saw the world this way. Not only did synaesthesia give me a great appreciation for music, I suspect it gave me a great advantage too. Like that scene in where Beth plays out entire chess games in her mind. I don’t need to memorise a piece of music because it’s playing out in front of me in colour – similar to playing Guitar Hero. Playing in tune comes easily to me and I can be incredibly focused. My parents picked up on this talent and sent me to Kent Junior Music School, where I learnt the violin. We’d play these passionate pieces and I remember thinking “more purple, more purple”. I was in my early teens when I first heard the word synaesthesia. A family friend had just discovered she had grapheme-colour synaesthesia – when one’s brain associates letters and numbers with certain colours. For years, I’d been describing my feelings of sensory overload when I listened to music. I’d always found orchestras tiring because they’re so noisy and my violin teacher used to tell me off for doing my scales with my eyes closed. My dad must have made the link. Eventually I learnt that I have chromesthesia (auditory-visual) synaesthesia; a common form in which specific sounds evoke the experience of seeing colours. I started talking more openly about it but that led to me being picked on. I remember sitting in my school brass band, playing a piece of music that looked so ecstatically beautiful I ended up crying. A girl turned around and told me everyone thought I was weird. It took me more than 20 years to start talking about synaesthesia again after that. I went on to play in orchestras including the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, and that feeling of breathing together – with everyone in flow – felt like ecstasy. I regularly teach about performance anxiety but the irony is performing is often the only time I don’t have anxiety. I get anxious in crowds, queueing in the interval – but getting on stage? That’s the easy part. When I decided to speak about my synaesthesia again, it was nerve-racking. After a period of depression at work, a mental health specialist helped me to reframe my synaesthesia as a gift. I realised I had an opportunity to raise awareness and help those eight-year-old synaesthetes who might also be scared of being bullied. Since then I’ve created a primary school program about normalising difference and I’ve launched an album of improvised sound baths in nature as a way of promoting awareness of neurodivergence. A big part of both projects is improvisation: a wonderful way to surprise my brain and boost my synaesthesia. I’ve also been researching the 1930s Australian composer Miriam Hyde, who had auditory-visual synaesthesia like me. She too struggled with sensory overload and her diaries talk about hyper-focusing on the piano for eight hours at a time, which I relate to. She is also an icon because she was 65 when doing a lot of her greatest work. At 57, it’s got me thinking: what if I run concerts for neurodiverse people, with fewer bright lights and less hanging about at the interval? Could I create an online community for synaesthetes? I feel passionately that we should be encouraging synaesthetes to thrive in schools, because they’ll be the ones who turn into great synaesthetic artists like Billie Eilish and Lorde and Miriam Hyde. It’ll also stop them from being depressed or bullied – because that’s often the alternative without framing this phenomenon as the superpower it really is. Synaesthesia is not a disorder; it’s a variation of human perception (a neurodiversity) that should be celebrated. I only wish I’d discovered that decades earlier.

Alain Rodriguez Colina was working at a scrapyard that was one of the businesses into which UPS Flight 2976 crashed as it took off from Louisville’s airport on 4 November. Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, and Louisville’s mayor, Craig Greenberg, each confirmed that Rodriguez died on Thursday. “Alain is the 15th victim of the UPS Flight 2976 accident,” Greenberg on X. “He suffered severe injuries at the time of the crash and passed earlier this Christmas Day. “May Alain’s memory be a blessing.” Rodriguez’s death “tough news” while soliciting prayers for the loved of all those who were killed in the crash. “Let’s pray for these families today and in the days, months and years to come so they know they are not alone and they are loved.” Sean Garber, owner of Grade A Auto Parts & Recycling, told the Louisville news outlet that Rodriguez was the fourth of the company’s employees to die in the plane crash. Customers of Grade A were killed as well. said Rodriguez worked at Grade A since 2023, developing a reputation for “always greeting customers with a smile, while going above and beyond for each”. Beside people on the ground, three on UPS Flight 2976 died when the plane’s left engine detached as it departed Muhammad Ali international airport, home to the package delivery service’s largest hub. Terrifying video captured the MD-11 plane that was fully loaded with fuel for a trip to Hawaii as it barreled into businesses near the airport and erupted into a fireball. The National Transportation Safety Board later said that investigators found cracks where the plane’s engine connected to its wing. Four days after the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all MD-11s, which for more than a decade had been used exclusively to fly cargo. UPS in early December was met with a pair of wrongful death lawsuits that accused the company of continuing to fly older planes without stepping maintenance up beyond the regularly scheduled amount. The manufacturer of the plane’s detached engine, General Electric (GE), was also named as a defendant in those lawsuits. Both UPS and GE have said they do not comment on unresolved lawsuits but asserted that safety was their top priority as they assisted investigators scrutinizing the 4 November crash.",Ramon Antonio Vargas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The president said in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest , who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries! “I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.” The US military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with the Nigerian authorities. An earlier statement posted by the command on X said the strike had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but that statement was later removed. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said he was “grateful for Nigerian government support + cooperation”. Forests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of the Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) known locally as ‘Lakurawa’. Some analysts say the latter’s cell in the state began as a group of herders banding together to fight incursions from bandits, in the absence of state support. Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the US, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups. “This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,” the ministry said in a post on X. Earlier this month US planes conducted surveillance missions over the region. It’s believed they were using an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a launch base. Trump has previously said he would launch a “guns-a-blazing” US military intervention in Nigeria, claiming that the country’s government has Nigeria is officially a secular country but its population is almost evenly divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution. However, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups. . In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water, but exacerbated by ethnicity and religion. , but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination. The strikes happened a day after a Christmas Eve bombing at a mosque in northeast Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 others seriously wounded. The Nigerian army has attributed the suicide bombing in Borno, the centre of a jihadist insurgency for almost two decades, to Boko Haram. Trump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extricating the US from decades of “endless wars”.

But gathering around a table to play a board game can peel kids off their screens and pull families together in a way few things can. That’s a big reason why family game night is such a treasured tradition in many households, especially during the holidays. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. You could opt for classics such as Monopoly and Scrabble of course, but there is so much variety and diversity in modern that you would be missing out. If you’re willing to expand your horizons, we promise there’s a new game on this list that will have your family members clearing calendars for a rematch. I have played modern board games for nearly two decades, with three large shelves in my living room overflowing with games. I’m always down for a game of King of Tokyo, but I’ve also lost hours to Wingspan and my personal all-time favorite, Sleeping Gods. I constantly refer to the BoardGameGeek forums, visiting is on my bucket list, and I sometimes facilitate Ladies Game Night over at my local game store. To assemble this list, I chatted with several board game retailers and experts with a special focus on family-oriented games. Based on my own knowledge of the industry and experience playing many of the titles they mentioned, I trust their expertise. I gave each expert category ideas like cooperative games, games for big groups, and games for young kids, then compiled their recommendations for each. The top pick in each category goes to the game that was most frequently recommended by our experts, but my conversations turned up all sorts of fun alternatives, which are also provided. , a board game store established in 1985. , a tabletop and board game community hub in San Francisco. Dogpatch Games frequently runs gaming events for kids and families. , a board game content creator who is a co-host on , a bi-weekly podcast and video series. She also creates board game song parodies and is a mother of two children. , a family-run business (which they run alongside their son Grant) on a mission to grow awareness of the modern board game hobby while championing diversity, inclusion and equity. , a board game podcast and streaming channel. Sheldon is a mother of two children and Hutchinson is a teacher in Ontario, Canada. Most of the experts agree that the primary characteristic of a family board game is that there should be a low barrier to entry. “We love to give suggestions of games that are easy to learn,” said Starla Fitch. “Most people are not going to sit around and read a rule book for an hour. We try to find things you can learn within 10 to 15 minutes.” Chavez knows time is tight and attention spans are short. “We’re not going to send you on something that takes 45 minutes to just learn,” he says. “Ideally it’s something you can pop out, learn in a few minutes, and then just run with it.” The game length shouldn’t be too long either. “Around 30 to 45 minutes is the sweet spot,” said Hutchinson. Other considerations include a wide age range and a large player count, in case you have an intergenerational family or there are guests over for the holidays. “When we’re thinking of family board games, we think of flexibility,” said Ballou. He also likes games that come in relatively small package, so they’re easily portable. One game kept getting recommended by our experts more than any other, and that was Bomb Busters. It also happens to be the winner of the 2025 , the world’s most prestigious award for board and card games. “It’s a cooperative game with deduction and limited communication,” said Valdes. “Those are all things I love.” In Bomb Busters, everyone is working together to defuse a bomb by cutting the right wires. The wires are represented by tiles numbered 1 through 12 which are then dealt out amongst the players. There are 66 missions and each plays a little differently, but the goal is always the same: go through all 12 numbers without the bomb going off. Players take turns pointing at each other’s wires, guessing their values, giving hints and cutting wires if the guess is correct. “The difficulty goes up each time you go through the missions,” said Mik Fitch, who picked Bomb Busters as the best cooperative game. “You’re going against villains, trying to save the world from people that want to blow it up. It’s a lot of fun.” Cascadia is another widely praised pick, especially for those who want a lightly competitive yet gentle nature-based game. It was also the Spiel des Jahres winner in 2022. Set in the Pacific north-west, the object of Cascadia is to build out habitats by laying terrain tiles and then populating them with the appropriate wildlife. You gain points based on matching terrain and if you satisfy various wildlife goals – like creating a run of salmon or keeping hawks away from other hawks. “It’s just a beautiful game,” said Starla. “I think it can resonate with a lot of people, especially if you like the outdoors.” If you can’t find Cascadia in stores, Harmonies is a great alternative. It’s a newer game (published in 2024) so it tends to be more available. Like Cascadia, Harmonies is also about building an ecosystem with habitats and wildlife, but it is slightly more strategic. It’s also one of Sheldon’s and Hutchinson’s picks for best overall game. “The art is adorable,” said Hutchinson. “The rules are very straightforward, very clear, but there’s still a lot of gameplay. It’s different every time you play it.” Another favorite is Creature Comforts, where you play cute woodland creatures gathering goods to fix up their dens for the winter. The Fitches describe this as a very cozy game, perfect for the winter. “It’s cute, but there’s a bit of strategy involved,” said Mik. Kingdomino is an excellent game to introduce to your family, especially if they’re already familiar with dominoes. In Kingdomino, you’re exploring new lands to expand your kingdom. It uses terrain tiles with two sections, very similar to dominoes, which you then match for points. “It’s really simple,” said Hutchinson. “Even young kids can understand matching water to water.” If you want to have a raucous family game night, Hot Streak is where it’s at. In Hot Streak, you race mascots along a race track (Think the , but sillier). Players bet on which mascots they think will win, and then flip cards to move the mascots along the track. Sometimes they’ll move forward; sometimes they’ll swerve to another lane; sometimes get turned around and run backwards. “The mascot race is hilarious,” said Sheldon. “There’s so much fun, delightful stuff in this game. It’s great for a crowd and anybody can play it, even young kids. There’s a bit of spectacle about it so everybody can be engaged and enjoy it, no matter how much they’re playing.” “It’s so funny,” Hutchinson agreed. “The figures also look amazing, the racetrack is a roll-out mat as well. It’s very well-made.” The Gang is essentially a cooperative version of Texas hold ’em poker. “It’s easy to play and people we played with just love it,” said Mik Fitch. “There are cards that teach you the hierarchy of poker hands so you don’t have to know poker to play.” In The Gang, players bet on how good they think their hand of cards will be in order of first to last. As more cards are revealed, their hands are reevaluated through communication, but without explicitly revealing their hand. For example, you can say: “I have a really good hand, I think I could win this” and then vote accordingly. If all players correctly assess their hands, they get to open a bank vault. If not, an alarm is tripped. Open a bank vault three times, and everyone wins. For people who are completely new to cooperative games, Chavez thinks Forbidden Desert is a good introduction. In it, you’re stranded on a desert and you and the other players have to work together to recover a flying machine and escape the desert’s treacherous shifting sands. A slightly easier version of Forbidden Desert is Forbidden Island, which also comes highly recommended as a great cooperative game. Another popular pick for a cooperative game is Hanabi – also a good stocking stuffer. Players must work together to place cards in the right order in order to put on a fireworks show. That seems simple, but there’s a twist: you can’t see your own cards because you hold them facing other people. You have to try to give hints about what their cards are with clue actions and tokens, and no other communication. In The Mind, you’re trying to play cards from one to 100 in a single stack – but without any communication. “Basically, you’re trying to create a hive mind,” says Chavez, who recommended it as one of her favorite cooperative games. “You just have to go off vibes and people looking at you intently.” Like with Hanabi, this would make for an ideal stocking stuffer. The Game is very similar to The Mind – except it’s slightly easier to win. Instead of playing the cards sequentially in real time, you play in clockwise turn order. The cards are also placed on four stacks instead of just one. Limited communication is allowed, like pointing at cards and giving hints. Hutchinson especially likes The Game because you can jump in and out. “If a kid or somebody gets bored while they’re playing, they can just hand their cards to someone else and the play can continue,” she said. Flip 7 was frequently mentioned as an excellent game for multiple categories, but at just under $8, it’s also a perfect budget pick. It can also accommodate large groups since it plays up to 18 people, and works as a stocking stuffer due to its small package. You get a whole lot of bang for very little buck. The goal of Flip 7 is to get 200 points. There’s just one instruction: flip over cards without flipping the same number twice. That might sound easy, but there are several special cards that could help or hurt you in your endeavor. “It’s like Uno meets blackjack,” said Chavez, describing it as a push-your-luck game. “You keep going: ‘Can you risk it? Can you risk it all?’” said Mik Fitch. “It’s a lot of fun.” Cabanga is a small, lightweight and inexpensive game (making it good for a stocking stuffer) that costs just $10. In it, you attempt to shed cards from your hand by matching them to the row in the middle. If there’s a large number gap between the two cards, other players can shout “Cabanga!” and toss in cards with values in between the two, forcing you to pull from the penalty pile. Valdes picked Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza ($10) in part because it’s simple and quick, which is great for people who aren’t usually into playing games. “It’s a speed card game with those cards [taco, cat, goat, etc] and you alternate flipping them over while saying the names in order,” she said. When the card sequence matches the name of the game, everyone slaps their hand on the pile and the last player has to pick up all the cards. The first person to get rid of all their cards wins. When it comes to party games, Hues and Cues is often mentioned as a crowd favorite. It’s also pretty simple to teach. Players must describe a color using only one or two-word clues, while others try to identify it on a grid of 480 hues. The closer your guess to the answer, the more points you get. “I had someone we were playing with who pulled a purple and said ‘Grimace,’” said Chavez. “And we were like, ‘Oh no, what does Grimace even look like?’” In Green Team Wins, players compete to come up with the most popular answer based on a series of questions. Example questions are: “What color should green be? Lime, apple or watermelon” or “curly fries or waffle fries?”. If you give the most popular answer, you join the green team, if you don’t, you join the orange team. Players can often switch teams based on their answers. After 15 rounds, if you’re still on the green team, you win. Ticket to Ride is a popular game where players compete with each other to build train routes across the map on the board, and First Journey is the junior version. “It has less cards to deal with, the train pieces are chunkier and the routes are shorter,” said Starla. “The rules are also a little different so younger kids will have a better gaming experience. It’s not as competitive as the big Ticket to Ride.” For a more exciting alternative, the Fitches recommend Dodos Riding Dinos: First Race. “It’s cute because you’re racing these little dodo birds riding dinosaurs,” said Starla. Not only do players race their Dodos and Dinos, they can also launch projectiles at their opponents. There’s also a more grown-up version of this game just called Dodos Riding Dinos, but the Fitches say that version is more competitive. “The adult version can be pretty mean,” said Mik. “That could maybe hurt some feelings. The kid version is friendlier and the race is shorter too.” In Zombie Kidz Evolution, players are young students at a school working together to stave off a zombie invasion. This is a “legacy” game, which means the game changes over time. That in and of itself could prove exciting to young children. “It’s a very simple game,” said Valdes. “But after you play a few times, you unlock new rules and abilities, so it’s an evolving game. You get to put stickers in the rulebook and open up envelopes, and my kids love that.” Kids can live out their insect dreams in Kabuto Sumo, where players take on the role of beetles trying to win a wrestling match against other beetles. “You want to push the other sumo bugs off the tree stump” said Chavez. “It’s very tactile and cute.” If your kids like solving puzzles, then consider Outfoxed!, a deduction game where players have to work together to find the fox who stole a pie. “I’ve played this a ton with my kids, and we love it every time,” said Sheldon. “You’re all tromping around this board and there are cute little clues that you uncover while working together. Even as an adult, I was fully engaged!” A couple of our experts suggested Monikers, a trivia and charades-style party game, as well as Ransom Notes, a magnetic poetry game, as good family games. They skew a little older (17+) so we didn’t include them here, but we thought they’re worth noting in case your family also skews a little older. The Unlock! series of escape-room style games were also recommended a couple of times as good cooperative options. Some of these easily last close to an hour in play length, however. They can also only be played once – as is typical of escape room games – so that is something else to consider. That said, these are very popular and there are over 20 different variations of them so they’re worth checking out. There were also a lot of game recommendations we didn’t include because there just isn’t enough space for all of them! Here are the options that didn’t quite make it in:",Nicole Lee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A flood watch was also extended through Thursday for almost all of the area, as more than 11in of rainfall was measured in some parts of county as of Wednesday night and evacuation warnings were issued for mountain communities in San Bernardino county. “There is a moderate risk of excessive rainfall over parts of southern California,” the US Weather Prediction Center said in a early on Thursday. “Numerous flash flooding events are possible. In addition, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.” On Wednesday, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles county and other southern counties, citing flooding and landslides risks in areas affected by last year’s wildfires. The Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, “I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel. Please do not take this storm lightly – follow official guidance, plan ahead and sign up for emergency alerts,” she said. At about 1pm on Thursday, the San Bernardino county sheriff’s department the shelter-in-place order for the community of Wrightwod to an evacuation order. “There is still a potential for mud and debris flows from an approaching storm that may affect your area,” the sheriff’s department said. The powerful storm, which is forecast to continue over the Christmas holiday until Saturday, has already prompted evacuations and brought with it road closures, flooded freeways and flight delays. On Thursday afternoon, 102,900 customers were to be out of power across the state, according to Poweroutage.com. The majority of the outages were reported in Monterey, in central California, where 15,458 customers were without power. A 64-year-old man was killed in the City Heights neighborhood of San Diego on Wednesday morning when a 75ft-tall tree fell on him, the San Diego police department said. The family of Roberto Ruiz told that he stepped out of their home to move his car when part of the tree fell, crushing him. A woman was also swept nine miles down San Jose Creek before she was rescued, the Los Angeles county fire department said. The woman, whose name has not been released, was first spotted in the creek but when rescue crews arrived she had already been carried downstream. “She went downstream for a while,” Pauline McGee, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles county fire department, In Los Angeles, evacuation orders were issued for about 130 homes considered especially vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows in areas where last year’s wildfires ravaged the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. As of Thursday afternoon, the Los Angeles fire department had deployed teams to three river rescue incidents. Meanwhile, the city’s police department responded to more than 100 traffic accidents, although there were no traffic-related injuries or deaths. The city’s water and power department crews were also working to restore power to 7,783 reported outages. Moreover, the city’s transportation department crews were working to restore five traffic signals that experienced outages while other city crews worked to address reports of nearly 500 tree emergencies including downed trees and fallen branches. Across the city, residents could pick up free sandbags at all fire stations, with up The burned vegetation had made the land unable to soak up the water, experts said. “Those soils are still hydrophobic, which means that rain just runs off like it’s hitting hard dirt or concrete,” said Scott Kleebauer, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, . “There are burn scars that have lasted for four or five years before you see any improvement.” The Angeles Crest Highway, a major traffic route through the San Gabriel Mountains, was closed in two stretches due to flooding. National Weather Service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said 4-8in of rain had fallen in some foothill areas, and the Los Angeles City News Service reported numerous rockslides in the mountains. Forecasters also issued a rare tornado warning for a small portion of east-central Los Angeles county due to heavy thunderstorm activity over the community of Alhambra. As of Wednesday night, rainfall over the region had subsided, but a second wave of the storm system was due to hit on Thursday, forecasters said.",Edward Helmore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-tax losses at the British brand led by the daughter of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney widened to £33.6m in 2024 from £25m the year before, while sales fell 27% to £16m, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The latest loss comes after the brand’s directors warned it could run out of cash by 2028 even if its parent company, Anin Star Holding, which is controlled by the designer, did not call in its loans. The label has not made a pre-tax profit since 2017 and has warned for about a need for additional funding to keep going. Directors said the company, which is known for its ethical stance and not using leather or fur, had identified contingency measures to spin out cash reserves for longer but admitted they “may consider alternative sources of funding to secure the long-term viability of the business”. The Stella McCartney brand, whose vegan handbags sell for nearly £1,000, said sales rose in the UK and in its stores last year but that was offset by a decline in royalty and wholesale income, which dragged down sales overall. The directors, who include the designer, blamed “challenging market conditions” for the fall in sales. with even their well-heeled clientele forced to economise amid the rising cost of living and Chinese shoppers reining in spending. such as Burberry have also blamed slower UK sales on the previous government’s decision to end tax breaks for tourists. McCartney bought back a 49% stake in her eponymous brand in January this year that had been controlled by luxury conglomerate LVMH. The deal reflected “her desire to write a new page in her story independently”, according to a joint statement from LVMH and McCartney at the time. Before that deal, the label was independent for just over a year after McCartney ended a 17-year partnership with rival luxury conglomerate Kering, the owner of Gucci, and , whose late mother was the photographer and animal rights activist Linda McCartney, designed her first jacket as a teenager. After work experience at Christian Lacroix, she rose to become the creative director of the Parisian fashion house Chloé, before starting her own label in a joint-venture with Kering in 2001.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/26/janessa-goldbeck-vet-voice-foundation-trump,How an ex-US marine became vital in the fight against Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement,2025-12-26T12:00:09.000Z,"When Trump began deploying troops to US cities, Janessa Goldbeck’s Vet Voice Foundation was ready – now they’re preparing for what may be next has probably imagined it. In 2023 the US marine veteran consulted on a documentary that war-gamed a presidential candidate staging a military coup. Last year she advised local leaders on the hypothetical of troops being deployed to their streets for immigration enforcement. won and Goldbeck’s nightmare came true. “It’s a little surreal to see something that we’ve been talking about and thinking about and stressing out about,” the chief executive of Vet Voice Foundation, a non-profit advocacy organisation, says via Zoom from her home in San Diego, California. “When we first did , the film, some folks would ask during our press tour, ‘Do you think you’re scaring people? This feels a little hyperbolic?’ It doesn’t feel good to say I told you so in this moment.” Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has sought to politicise the military like no other commander-in-chief before him and use it as a cudgel against Democratic-led states and cities. He has deployed thousands of national guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans and , triggering protests from local officials and residents. Having read the Project 2025 policy document, Goldbeck saw this coming. Last year , which mobilises veterans and military families to defend US democracy, ran exercises with local elected officials, activists and journalists to prepare for a second Trump administration conducting aggressive immigration enforcement. It has now become a vital resource for governors, state attorneys general and mayors trying to weather the storm. Goldbeck, 40, explains: “This year the vast majority of our work has been supporting litigation to halt or slow down national guard deployments, providing subject expert witnesses, retired generals, to talk through with staff what the footprint of these deployments might look like and how to prepare, and training for activist groups on who the guard is, who they’re not – the difference in the uniforms that the guys at ICE are wearing versus the national guard. “Then serving as advisers for governors and mayors who are living day to day through this, helping them shape their communications and ensure that things don’t become more violent. That’s been a huge line of effort for us.” It would be a mistake to assume that all national guard members are Make America Great Again (Maga) diehards eager to do Trump’s bidding. In every city except the capital, their role has eventually been restricted by courts to guarding federal property. Some have told Goldbeck that it is tedious and unfulfilling work. “There’s a wide range of feelings for the folks I’ve spoken to, ranging from boredom – this is a waste of time – to anger because they’ve been taken away from their families and their jobs. Most guardsmen make more in their civilian jobs than they do when they’re deployed but they signed up to serve their communities, to either serve overseas to protect the homeland or to respond in cases of a natural disaster. “They did not sign up to be ICE – immigration enforcement – and they did not sign up to police their friends and neighbours or to be deployed into ‘hostile territory’ where the governors, local police have said actually, we do not want you here.” Last month, two West Virginia national guard members were near the White House by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who had previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and arrived in the US in 2021. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe survived and has been released from hospital. Goldbeck comments: “After the horrific killing of the guardswoman in DC, there’s the question of: is the president putting these folks in danger unnecessarily? The answer to that, I believe, is absolutely yes, especially when they’re not necessarily trained for the mission they’re being asked to execute. But also they’re targets of opportunity for any madman who wants to create chaos or has a vendetta or a mental health crisis or whatever it is.” Then there is embarrassment. In Washington the national guard have been seen , helping commuters with luggage and feeding squirrels. Goldbeck continues: “I spoke to one mother of a guardsman in DC who said she’d had a phone call with him and he said, ‘Mom, they’re calling us the national gardeners on the internet,’ because they’re out there picking up trash. This is a combat vet who was a law enforcement official in his real life. “That’s humiliating to our service members. It just goes to show how deep this president’s disdain is for people who serve in uniform and how little he understands about the actual ethos of the military and what it’s there to do.” The deployments come in broader context that has seen Trump expand presidential power. He has sought to sideline Congress, gut the civil service, flout the law, weaponise the justice department against his perceived enemies and coerce law firms, media and universities. Goldbeck warns that he “I hope that people have learned that this administration, this president, mean what they say, even it if sounds absurd or anti-American or anti-democratic. They mean it. I absolutely think that this president wants to remain in power much longer, for as long as he can.” She adds: “My fear is that this is all a lead-up to potential use of the guard or the around the next election cycle. I’m not just dreaming about that. It’s because it’s been spoken about by very senior members of this administration and the president himself. That is incredibly alarming. It is not American to conduct elections with troops in the streets and to intimidate voters. It’s very authoritarian.” Goldbeck’s own story is testimony to the diverse, non-monolithic nature of the military. She was raised in San Diego by parents she describes as “children of the 60s and 70s” who were “vegetarian pacifist Hindus”. Her mother was an elementary school teacher and her father drove a tow truck. She attended Northwestern University, studying journalism and African studies. A study abroad programme in Uganda and Rwanda educated her on the unfolding genocide in , sparking her passion for activism. Returning to the US, she became the national student leader of a movement to compel the government to protect civilians in Darfur. Goldbeck’s activism in Washington brought her into contact with military and security personnel. She observed a disconnect between humanitarian workers and the security forces that enable their operations. To bridge this gap and gain a “master’s degree, so to speak, in military”, she decided to join the Marine Corps at age 25. This decision was a shock to her family. When she told her parents she was joining the Marine Corps, they were “horrified” and said: “These are not the values we raised you with.” This was the opposite of their reaction when she came out as gay, to which they responded, “We love you no matter what.” But over time, her parents came to take pride in her service. Goldbeck commissioned as a Marine Corps officer in 2012 and served for seven years as a combat engineer officer – a role she defines as someone who “builds things and blows things up” – while advocating for fellow female and LGBTQ+ service members. She spent years in Europe training US-allied countries but her final duty station brought her back home to oversee the integration of the west coast boot camp to include both male and female candidates. Goldbeck left the Marine Corps in 2019 for two primary reasons: her mother becoming seriously ill and the election of Trump. She felt she could not remain silent in uniform and “wanted to be involved in pushing back” against what she saw happening to the country. A few weeks after leaving the service, her local member of Congress retired, and Goldbeck was . Although she did not win, the experience led to an offer to lead the Vet Voice Foundation, which represents about 2 million veterans, military family members and supporters. The foundation has been heavily involved in protecting public lands, citing a deep connection between veterans and the outdoors for healing and reconnecting with family. Following the supreme court’s decision to , the foundation has advocated to ensure that female service members stationed in states with restrictive abortion laws could travel to get necessary medical care. that the justice department was laying the groundwork for voter roll purges that disproportionately target groups including servicemen and women who move frequently or vote absentee. She noted that more than 30% of veterans have a service-connected disability and for many in-person voting is not feasible. Joining all the dots, she is concerned that the military’s status as an apolitical institution is under threat from Trump. She says: “This administration is doing harm to the world and to the nation in a lot of different ways but one of my chief concerns is about this generational harm that it’s doing to the professionalism and the apolitical nature of the military.” In this, she argues, Trump is being aided and abetted by Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence. to senior officers at a military base in Quantico, Virginia, Hegseth railed against “woke” culture, railed against “fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon” and insisted: “No more beardos.” Pete Hegseth is unequivocally the least qualified person who ever led the department of defense. Hegseth has also gone on the record with the opinion: “ ”. This is anathema to Goldbeck, who put herself forward for infantry officer training, a position then closed to female marines, and later worked with advocacy groups to successfully repeal the policy. She states that in the decade since women have served successfully and standards have not been lowered. “To see this fight that has already been litigated, has already put to bed, that nobody in the service is actually still grumbling about except for a few guys that have holes in their soul that will never be filled, is so incredibly infuriating,” she reflects.",David Smith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/with-numbers-of-abandoned-cats-soaring-we-somehow-found-ourselves-with-11,"With numbers of abandoned cats soaring, we somehow found ourselves with 11",2025-12-26T11:00:07.000Z,"How our two-bedroom terrace become something of a cat rescue centre is illustration of nationwide crisis How many cats is too many cats? I can’t tell you exactly, but a couple of weeks ago, I had 11 cats living in my terrace house. And I can say with confidence this is absolutely, definitely too many. At time of writing, I still have seven. Somehow, my home has, against my will and better judgment, become something of a cat rescue centre, and an illustration of what Protection has described as a growing crisis of abandoned felines. This all started last summer, when I convinced my husband, Michael, that we needed a kitten as company for our grumpy old ginger boy Phillip, which would bring our number of cats to the completely normal and socially acceptable number of two. We contacted a local rescue centre, and they in turn convinced us we didn’t need one kitten, we needed two. Taking two, they said, would mean they would entertain each other; it would be less work for us. The fact that they were overrun with kittens they needed to rehome was, I’m sure, merely coincidental. So, Joanne and Susan (combined with Phillip – they’re named after ) came to live with us; their mother had been found heavily pregnant a few weeks before, by some bins in an alley, and taken to the rescue centre. And we were more than content with our Feline League. Until one day in September when a neighbour, Viv, came knocking on our back door. She’d found some kittens in the back alley and didn’t know what to do. (Presumably she thought Michael and I would be best placed to help with excess cats, as we already had more cats than anyone else in the street.) , where terrace houses back on to alleyways. We’ve always had the odd stray, and our neighbours look out for them, leaving out food and beds. But in recent months, the problem had grown from the odd stray into something of a cat colony. Viv had gone to take out the blanket from a carrier to wash it and found three five-day-old black kittens inside. I thought I knew exactly what to do in this situation. I rang a cat rescue charity, who would just come and collect them. Except every single one I tried was full. I rang the RSPCA; because the cats weren’t sick or injured, it wasn’t in their remit. My options, it transpired, were “leave them there or take them in”. It could only ever be the latter. We named the three babies (then of unknown sex) Leslie, Stevie and Toni and also took in the mother, calling her Phillipa, after Phillip. This seemed like a great idea when the plan was to rehome her, but we’ve decided to keep her, and even though she now goes by Pippa, we must appear to have a distinct lack of imagination. We had a steady stream of neighbours drop round with cat food, treats and even cash (to help cover Leslie’s vet bills, as she was found with a bad eye infection). I’d got in touch with Cats Protection, who had, over the course of several weeks, trapped, neutered and returned seven cats who were still living in the alley, and I’d even managed to find homes for three of them. Viv is still hoping to find patient and experienced cat owners for the others. By the end of October, with the seven alley cats largely dealt with, and the seven cats in our house more or less peacefully coexisting, things felt a bit more settled. We thought that must surely be all that the cat distribution system had in store for us. Then, just before Halloween, a message popped up on the WhatsApp group for our streets: “Can anyone help with this? We’ve found a mumma cat and four kittens.” The 12-week-old black-and-white kittens were running around in the alley and into the road; we spoke to the owner of the mother, who said she was “trying to get rid of them” and agreed to surrender the kittens to us. And so we found ourselves walking home with our second litter of kittens in as many months, bringing the total number of cats in our house up to 11. I’d been fine with three, fine with seven, but with 11 in the house my eyes were itching, my nose started running and I was rooting through the bathroom cabinet for the antihistamines. Our house is a two-bedroom terrace, with an open plan downstairs, which is lovely for letting the light flow through but less ideal for storing multiple litters of kittens. As we have a cat flap on the back door for our existing cats, who have come to be known as the “downstairs cats”, we needed to keep all of the new unvaccinated and unneutered arrivals upstairs and behind closed doors. Michael had already moved his computer from his office to the dining table to accommodate the first litter, but with our only spare room already full of cats, we had no option but to keep the second set of kittens in our bathroom. After experiencing the least peaceful bath of my life the day after they arrived, I did not attempt a second one until they’d gone. Luckily, the second litter were old enough to be rehomed straight away, and three days later we had our bathroom back and I could breathe through my nose again. Pippa’s kittens will be old enough to go to their new homes soon, and we’ll be down to the almost reasonable number of four cats. But we fear it may be only a matter of time until the next resident litter. With the cost of living increasing, . Figures from Cats Protection’s annual study of cat ownership and welfare found that neutering numbers had fallen to 82%, down from 85% in 2024 and 88% in 2020. Younger cat owners are also less likely to have neutered their pet, with 71% of cats owned by those aged 18 to 34 neutered, compared with 95% of those belonging to people aged over 55. “In the last 12 months, around 5,100 stray cats came into the care of Cats Protection, representing around 18% of all cats taken in by the charity,” said SuiLi Weight, a senior community operations outreach manager for the organisation. “However, centres and branches across the UK regularly reach capacity, meaning it’s vital to prevent cats from becoming strays in the first place.” “We’re seeing a worrying rise in the number of stray and abandoned cats, which is putting huge pressure on animal rescues across the country,” Alice Potter, cat welfare expert at the RSPCA, added. “Our centres are full, and we currently have more than 300 cats being cared for in private boarding facilities. The soaring cost of living and fewer cats being neutered are clearly having an impact. “Many owners are struggling with vet costs or delaying neutering, which has led to more unwanted litters. Cats can breed from as young as four months old, and a single female can have up to 18 kittens a year – so numbers can quickly spiral.” And don’t we know it. “Are you sure you’ll be fine with having three?” I asked a neighbour, as she came to pick up two of the second litter. She’d already taken in one of the neutered alley cats. “Sure,” she replied, “what’s three when you’ve already got one?” Unfortunately, this kind of dangerous thinking is exactly how we got ourselves into this mess in the first place.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/my-weirdest-christmas-sweden-big-british-celebration,My weirdest Christmas: it was our first year in Sweden – but I insisted on having a big British celebration,2025-12-26T12:00:08.000Z,"When my family emigrated to Malmö, I wanted to stick to our traditions, but my husband was keen to embrace the local customs. Why were we butting heads? Eve and already getting dark. As I stripped off on a wooden pier over the Baltic Sea in Malmö, Sweden, my husband and five-year-old boy, bundled up against the harsh wind, chanted: “Go Mummy, go Mummy, go Mummy!” Just as I was about to heroically slither out of my final layer, a bearded, completely naked man, who can only be described as Viking-esque, ascended the wooden ladder from the sea, looked at me with horror and possibly hypothermia in his eyes and shook his head. I put my five layers of clothing back on and, feeling deflated, suggested we crack open the Thermos. I knew I had failed at Swedish Christmas. My family and I emigrated to from the UK last winter, and while the days seemed impossibly short and dark, we were buoyed up by optimism, (Swedish mulled wine) studded with almonds and raisins, and our new city, scattered with fairy lights. However, as the advent countdown began, a cold front harsher than the Baltic Sea swept through our cosy new home. My husband wanted to be “more Swedish than the Swedes”; I wanted some familiar traditions to pass on to my son. And so, December became a period of friendly but fierce negotiations. Yes, I still wanted Christmas cake, and it was important to me to have roast potatoes with dinner. I went to the Taste of Britain shop in town in search of Bisto gravy and some exorbitantly priced crackers. Sure, we could open presents on Christmas Eve, as is the Swedish way, but we needed to save my son’s stocking and “big present” for Christmas morning proper. We went to a Christmas market every weekend, where the only food on offer was the ubiquitous hotdog and (Swedish gingersnaps). Instead of visiting a cheerful, rosy-cheeked Santa, my little boy queued for a long time to see a taciturn , a sort of grumpy house elf, who took my little boy’s wishlist of strictly , signed it and handed it back with the exhausted resignation of a job centre adviser. Instead of roast dinner, my husband wanted to have the traditionally Swedish Jansson’s temptation: a gratin of potatoes, anchovies, cream and onion, an unfathomable selection of fish – gravlax, fermented herring and roe – and perhaps a large Christmas ham. It didn’t matter how much I reminded my usually easy-going spouse that none of us liked baked ham or fish that much – Christmas was Eventually, on Lucia Day – a traditional day of candlelit processions of angelic kids, held on the 13 December, that’s meant to bring light and hope to dark winter – we untangled our adversarial tinsel. My husband, who had moved to Switzerland from London aged eight, explained that he had always felt slightly out of place and, as a result, wanted our son to adopt the most Swedish traditions as soon as possible, so that he could fully assimilate. Meanwhile, I had grown up in a selection of homeless hostels and council flats in Scotland and England, with very little money and even fewer happy Christmas memories. I wanted to give my son the perfect festive season that I had always imagined: a Christmas tree, a huge trifle, photos in an ugly Christmas jumper with Santa, a joyful frenzy of wrapping paper on Christmas morning. Each of us just wanted our little boy to have a great Christmas – and we soon realised we could do both: a table laden with sprouts herring. This year, instead of quarrelling on Christmas Eve about whether we’ll watch The Snowman or, as in so many Swedish homes, From All of Us to All of You), a 1958 festive Donald Duck cartoon, we’ll do both. We’ll supersize our celebrations, Scots-Swedish style, and embrace excess. I will be taking that Baltic sea dip on Christmas Eve and also paying wildly over the odds for a tub of Twiglets and an imported Radio Times. We’re not quite Swedish, no longer really British, but our Christmas will be as sweet and shiny as a box of Quality Street. A cool Jul for the whole family.",Kerry Hudson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/26/hollywood-production-film-tv-industry-struggles,‘Not the charmed industry it once was’: can Hollywood find its comeback story?,2025-12-26T12:00:09.000Z,"After the writers’ and actors’ strikes, the pandemic, and structural shifts in technology, LA’s trying to find its footing in a changed industry he veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California. It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest. Late last year, McCleery was at last hired to work on the second season of Fallout, a post-apocalyptic television drama based on a popular computer game that was moving from New York to LA. It was a welcome chance to sleep in his own bed and, McCleery hoped, a step toward a much-needed recovery for LA after the pummeling the city took during the Covid pandemic and, again, during twin strikes by the writers’ and actors’ guilds in 2023. On set, though, McCleery found only different symptoms of the same old dysfunction – not because things were bad, but because they were eerily, almost uncomfortably good. The lighting crew, he noticed, was essentially an all-star team – everybody in town he could have dreamed of working with. The same was true of the grips, who specialize in rigging and setting up cameras, and of the camera crew itself. “Even the day workers were superstars in their own right,” McCleery said. “And of course it was all a function of what was going on in Hollywood, because a lot of people who should have been busy were very much available.” Fallout has proved, at least so far, to be an outlier in breaking the increasingly fraught pattern of “runaway production” – Hollywood film and TV shoots that have strayed far from Hollywood the geographical location. The show’s producers certainly hoped for a different outcome, since they – and subsequently took full advantage of – a boost in state incentives to lure as many productions as possible back to California. The show received $25m in state funding to come to LA for season two, which wrapped in May, and a staggering $166m to stay on for season three. Still, the news across most of the rest of the industry has remained stubbornly bleak. At a time when Hollywood is of the beloved director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, big structural shifts in the technology and corporate structure of entertainment have made it impossible to emulate Reiner’s record of smart, funny, character-driven hits from the 1980s and 1990s because the business model for them has And those shifts have hit Los Angeles hard. According to data compiled by state lawmakers and a watchdog that tracks industry data, contributions to the motion picture pension plan have dropped by about one-third over the past three years – a sign of particularly bad times for LA’s unionized actors, writers, crew members and truckers. The number of shooting days in LA fell more than 20% between the beginning of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, and LA’s share of overall worldwide production in film and television fell from 21.9% in 2022 to 18.3% two years later. Every week brings more grim headlines, some of them LA-specific and some a reflection of a broader industry malaise. A beloved in North Hollywood that made its living renting costumes to television and movie productions closed its doors after a fire sale in October. Camera and equipment rental houses have either The owner of one of the few remaining car lots catering to industry needs – anything from vintage cruisers to ambulances to smashed-up sports coupes – said he was renting an average of six vehicles a day, down from a 42-a-day average in happier times. “I’ve been in business 56 years, and I own all 900 of my cars and motorcycles. All my competitors who lease their cars have gone bankrupt,” Ken Fritz of Studio Picture Vehicles said. In a town that gave birth to the disaster movie, it’s tempting to see such developments in apocalyptic terms. Owen Gleiberman, chief movie critic for the Hollywood Reporter, watched in horror as one highly touted movie after another flopped at the box office over the summer and early autumn – a reflection of changing audience habits and stiff competition for their attention from streaming services and smartphones. “It has seriously begun to look like the bottom is falling out,” he , reached for a similarly doom-laden tone earlier this year when pushing to increase the state’s production incentive program from $330m to $750m – a controversial move in the midst of a budget crunch that has left little room for discretionary spending. Newsom of the entertainment industry: “It’s on life support. We need to step things up.” Insiders and economists tend to paint a more nuanced picture of an industry that, they say, is very much alive but beset by overlapping crises, many of them triggered by major structural changes in the technology of both producing and delivering filmed entertainment. Most say these are global phenomena more than LA-specific problems, but that Los Angeles feels them most acutely because it has the most to lose. “Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the lion’s share of productions in the North American market were made in California and New York. California still leads the pack, but does so from a very diminished position,” said Philip Sokoloski of FilmLA, which keeps of production data on behalf of both the city and county of Los Angeles. “Fewer than one in five TV shows are made in , whereas even a few years ago it was closer to 30%. That’s a rather sudden drop.” Some of this, say industry insiders and economists, was bound to happen anyway. Advances in everything from filming technology to post-production effects have meant fewer overall shooting days on location, smaller crews, and far less physical handling of equipment or reels of finished film. Those advances have not only opened the industry to far more people than would have been imaginable a generation ago – a teenager can now shoot and edit a credible film with a phone and a laptop – it has also made it easier for production centres far from Los Angeles to train up a corps of highly accomplished industry professionals. “There is no piece of the industry that cannot now be done anywhere,” Sokoloski said. Layered on top of this trend is the fact that production has been in an unusually volatile boom-and-bust cycle, going back to the late 2010s when the arrival of streaming services created a seemingly insatiable appetite for content, and continuing through the pandemic, when demand for home entertainment reached even greater heights. The industry has been suffering an extended hangover ever since, with streaming services they previously commissioned and old-guard studios or, like Warner Bros which is now the subject of a ferocious, acquisition battle between Netflix and Paramount Skydance, putting themselves . Early in the decade Los Angeles went on a building spree to create more sound stages, but by the time the first of them were completed, demand had receded and more than one-third are now going unused. The arrival of big tech as a significant Hollywood player has both informed these developments and disrupted much of the way the industry works. Netflix, Amazon and others are now major producers as well as distributors of content, and their grip on the marketplace – exemplified by the Warner Bros deal – is making it harder for the old guard to keep competing. The old business model for movies is in tatters since titles are no longer given an extended run on the big screen before they appear on streaming platforms, and movie-going itself has not recovered after the pandemic because of the convenience of watching from home. Christopher Thornberg, an economist whose firm, Beacon Economics, has written , argues that tech giants have had a similar effect on film and television as they have on the news media. “They have figured out how to make news organizations compete with each other to death while they make all the money, scraping stuff off the top and putting it on social media platforms. And the same’s true in Hollywood,” he said. “New production is struggling to find an outlet. Even the streaming services are beating the living crap out of each other. And who’s making the money? The servers, the people putting clips on YouTube and earning advertising revenue off of them.” Thornberg is sceptical that much, if any, of this structural headache can be fixed by bigger state incentives and subsidies, a position shared by some who question Newsom’s assertion that the incentives will . A better approach, Thornberg argues, would be for the studios and the guilds to lobby for stronger intellectual property rights that would put more money back in the pockets of content creators. Still, Thornberg believes talk of LA’s demise as the centre of the entertainment business is greatly exaggerated, because the business has always been cyclical and because the most stable and highest-paying jobs, in marketing, sales and distribution, are overwhelmingly based there and showing no signs of moving. “Los Angeles is still the centre of the universe, there’s no doubt about it,” he said. The flipside of that argument – pushed by champions of Newsom’s new incentive package and by FilmLA – is that even diminished location production has become too competitive to leave to market forces alone. There are now 120 centers around the world with the facilities to make films and television shows, Sokoloski said, which meant that LA needed every inducement to keep productions in town. “It’s an increasingly competitive environment,” he said. “Any amount lost is felt very keenly by the local entertainment workforce.” That sentiment was echoed by Michele Mulroney, president of the west coast chapter of the Writers Guild, who described the new state incentive package to the Los Angeles Times as “a of good news in an otherwise really bleak and tough time for our industry”. McCleery, the cinematographer, reflected that it is now a much more challenging business to enter than when he started out as a lighting specialist more than 30 years ago. “It’s not the idyllic and charmed industry that worked so well in LA for so long,” he said. “It’s controlled by different forces.” He agreed that Los Angeles was not facing an existential threat so much as a period of downsizing and restructuring. “It will come back, but in a different form and size,” he said. “I’m just hoping it will come back sooner than later.”",Andrew Gumbel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/24/how-to-end-the-year-right-personal-rituals,How to end the year right: come up with your own personal rituals,2025-12-24T17:00:16.000Z,"Rituals are different from routines – they elevate everyday life. Here’s how to create meaning beyond the festive season How do you celebrate the end of the year? Office parties can be a drag, but if you’re self-employed, it can be easy to roll without ceremony from one year into the next. Three years ago, two friends and I were bemoaning the lack of festivities and decided to make up for it by organising our own end-of-year lunch. It has become a beacon in my calendar: we find a restaurant we’ve been wanting to try, book the afternoon off and count down to the date. It always feels special and memorable. That’s the power of ritual, says Erin Coupe, a transformation coach and author of I Can Fit That In: How Rituals Transform Your Life. She defines rituals as “intentional, rhythmic choices” that bring us energy, presence and meaning. At this time of year, it’s traditional to take stock and set intentions for the next. But rituals aren’t just for special occasions, Coupe argues – they can elevate everyday life. Here are her tips for creating more meaning during the festive season and beyond. As well as repetition, structure and action, rituals are defined by intention and meaning, says Coupe. By contrast, routines often carry obligation or duty, and can be carried out mindlessly. A ritual “fills you up”, Coupe says: “You are purposely choosing to do it because you want to, and you know that it’s going to stir something within you.” This also distinguishes rituals from superficial versions of “self-care” that require you to spend money. There’s scope to create your own traditions. “Some rituals might be annual, or seasonal,” Coupe says. Instead of exchanging holiday gifts, Coupe’s family takes a holiday in early January: “That experience is the ritual, being together.” The same could apply to something like my freelance festive lunch. Enshrining a as a ritual makes it more meaningful and more likely to be prioritised, Coupe says: “There’s a cadence to it. It’s something you look forward to.” Instead of setting resolutions, Coupe chooses a single word to guide her year, based on what she wants to cultivate: for example, abundance, clarity or peace. She displays her chosen word prominently in her home. It’s “less daunting” than a resolution, she says, focusing on smaller and more immediate opportunities for change. Coupe also conducts an annual review of her work, looking at what went well, what she could do without and what she wants to pursue more of. Without such check-ins, she says, it’s easy to spend the year “just going through the motions”. It’s hard to bring more meaning to life if you don’t know what’s meaningful to you. “You have to be clear on what fills you up and what drains you,” Coupe says. She recommends making self-reflection a ritual – through journaling, meditation, yoga or a regular walk without headphones. Self-awareness is not the same as self-analysis or self-criticism. Coupe thinks of it as gaining understanding of your thoughts, and limiting beliefs and ways in which “you are working against yourself”. “If you’re not actually aware of what is moving within you, it can’t change,” Coupe says. “You’ve got to look at what’s going on inside and understand that, then start to shift.” When Coupe was working a stressful corporate job while raising two young children, she used to get up at 5.15am just to enjoy 45 minutes alone. “That was my time,” she says. It helped her cope better with work pressures, and gradually improved her mood and resilience. “I was more grounded, peaceful and becoming more patient, all because I was fueling something within myself,” she says. “You can’t say yes to everything,” Coupe says, “so how do you intentionally choose?” This year, I turned down some festive invitations so I could be present at others. In the past, I’d have tried to make them all, stretching myself mentally and financially. Unexpectedly, being selective increased my anticipation and enjoyment. Removing activities we only do out of obligation or habit creates space for more restorative ones. For years, Coupe had a glass of wine after work to “take the edge off”. She eventually stopped after realising it was more of a drain than a boost: “There was no intention – it was just something I did.” A ritual should feel special, even in a small way, and connect you to the present moment, says Coupe, “but it doesn’t have to be a grandiose thing”. Small actions can create space and improve our sense of control. Coupe suggests setting an intention while making your morning tea or coffee, saying: “You’re allowing your mind to just be present, and not automatically jump into having your energy and attention taken away from you.” Try reframing routines as rituals. I’ve long been haphazard about making my bed each morning; now, noticing how much calmer I feel afterward makes it seem less like a chore. One of Coupe’s friends realised her 6am yoga class was actually a private ritual. The mindset shift enhances our appreciation of such activities, Coupe says: “You’re viewing it from a place of growth and intention, instead of monotony and obligation.” Rituals can help mark transitions, such as the end of the working day. For those working from home, that might mean closing your laptop, clearing your desk or shutting the door to your workspace, if you have one, Coupe suggests. Listening to upbeat music on your commute or changing out of work clothes can also signal that it’s time to switch off. A few nights a week, Coupe takes a bath as part of her wind-down ritual, reading a book in the tub before bed. She also recommends spending 15 minutes on Sundays planning for the week ahead, noting potential stressors and ways to ease them where possible. For Coupe, embracing rituals was key to easing the daily grind and centering meaning and connection. If you create moments that feel special, that can help you to see life differently, she says. I’ve been surprised by how easy and effective it’s been to introduce new rituals. Things I once avoided, like chores or taking breaks, became more appealing when I focused on what they meant and reframed them as a deliberate choice. It’s inspired me to look for more opportunities to create rituals, especially those that connect me with others. Rituals aren’t just for Christmas. In fact, at the end of my festive lunch, we agreed to do it again sooner.",Elle Hunt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are the Guardian’s critics on the pick of the year’s cinematic calamities “Even the superest superfan of the legendary US TV comedy show Saturday Night Live is going to struggle with the unbearable self-indulgence and self-adoration of this exhausting film from director and co-writer Jason Reitman.” “Here is a pointless new live-action musical version of the Snow White myth, a kind of un-Wicked approach to the story and a merch-enabling money machine. Where other movies are playfully reimagining the backstories of famous villains, this one plays it straight, but with carefully curated revisionist tweaks. These are all too obviously agonising and backlash-second-guessing, but knowing that at some basic level the brand identity has to be kept pristine.” “The opening gala of Cannes can be such a gamble: a very exposed festival slot which few films need or want, and whose occupants so often turn out to be the squawking overfed turkeys of the big screen. Such a one, sadly, is this listless and supercilious musical – ostensibly on the theme of heartwarming home town values – which flatlines like a hedgehog run over by an 18-wheeler the moment the female lead opens her mouth to sing one of the film’s many terrible songs.” “The madly, bafflingly overwrought and humourless storytelling can’t overcome the fact that everything here is frankly unpersuasive and tedious. Every line, every scene, has the emoting dial turned up to 11 and yet feels redundant.” “Here is a cheap-ass knockoff of Ocean’s Eleven starring John Travolta that makes the Soderbergh film look like something by Andrei Tarkovsky or Ingmar Bergman … It is a heart-slowing work of staggering stupidity and charmlessness, ineptly made and quite frankly dull except when its flaws become so egregious you can’t help but guffaw.” “With a supremely annoying lead character called Mohsen, here is a jungle adventure that feels sewn together like a cruddy Frankenstein’s monster from the corpses of other shoddy animations – which themselves are patched together from far better films.” “In this dire, sentimental and self-indulgent film, George Clooney has the look of a man who has found strychnine in his Nespresso pod and can’t remember which of the cupboards in his luxury hotel suite contains the antidote.” “There’s something dispiriting about The Boatyard’s pointlessness, its lack of wit, empathy or basic film-making skill. The acting achieves such a finely tuned pitch of atrociousness it’s impossible to endure.” “No one seems to be quite sure what Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight’s ‘special ambassadorships’ entail, or if any of that troika of rightwing fellow travellers have fulfilled any official duties. But on the evidence of this, Stallone is already letting the side down – by making a film so bad it shames American cinema itself.” “What makes this film such an ordeal to watch is Malkovich’s amazing line-readings in French, in his laboriously slow and unmistakably American accent … He sounds like Dr Hannibal Lecter having smoked a hundredweight of weed, doing a derisive impression of an unctuous French headwaiter he intends to eat.” “The matrix of pointlessness is reloaded in this mind-bendingly dull sci-fi, more a screensaver than an actual film … there is no drama or jeopardy or human interest anywhere. This franchise now looks about as urgently contemporary as an in-car CD player.” “Keen though I always am to indulge any and every new riff on Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, and keen also to hear from Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha, this cynically Christmassy movie is leaden, unconvincingly acted and about as welcome as a dead rat in the eggnog.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), on Thursday against senior Trump allies including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, in an attempt to prevent what he says would be an unconstitutional arrest and removal. Ahmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, lives lawfully in Washington DC with his American wife and daughter. According to the BBC and other reports, court documents released on Thursday said Vernon S Broderick, a judge in the southern district of New York, had granted Ahmed’s request for a temporary restraining order over any moves to remove him from the US, and blocked officials from detaining him before his case could be heard.

In a statement, Ahmed said: “My life’s work is to protect children from the dangers of unregulated social media and AI and fight the spread of antisemitism online. That mission has pitted me against big tech executives – and “I am proud to call the United States my home. My wife and daughter are American, and instead of spending Christmas with them, I am fighting to prevent my unlawful deportation from my home country.” Roberta Kaplan, Ahmed’s legal counsel, said: “The state department’s actions here are unjustified and blatantly unconstitutional.” Ahmed was targeted alongside Clare Melford, who is based in the UK and runs the Global Disinformation Index (GDI). Musk has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/21/how-survive-family-christmas-arguments-mental-health-experts-tips,‘I’m going to scream!’: how to survive (and maybe even enjoy) your family Christmas,2025-12-21T06:00:51.000Z,"From preparing safe topics to taking silly games, we ask the experts how to avoid falling out with your nearest and dearest – before, during and after the big day Spending time with difficult family members requires careful planning, says Katie Rose, a therapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and the founder of . “If you’re going to stay with somebody for three or four days, find ways to politely give yourself a break. Go for lunch with friends who live locally, or book a ticket to a museum or a National Trust place so that you have ways of getting yourself out of the house.” Tamara Hoyton, a senior practitioner for , agrees that scheduling breaks is a good strategy. “Arrange a trip out, or offer to cook so that you’re away from the living room where everyone else is,” she says. “If we are coping with difficult situations and conversations, it’s important to stay grounded and present, so that our thoughts and feelings don’t spiral,” says BACP-registered counsellor . Practise grounding exercises in advance, so you can use them in tricky moments. Sturmer recommends the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. “Notice five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste,” she says. “This helps us connect to the environment that we’re in, so we’re more present and less anxious.” From politics to parenting styles, there are all kinds of things you might not want to get into with certain family members. Determine what these are and come up with some non-contentious alternatives. You could even prepare some phrases to say if you’re uncomfortable, says Lucy Blake, the author of : The Facts and Fictions of Family Life and a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of the West of England, whose research focuses on family relationships. “Think about some likely scenarios and ways you could respond,” says Blake. You could try to redirect the conversation and move it on, or say things like, “I find this a difficult topic to talk about”, she suggests. Thinking ahead is key, agrees Rose. “Notice what the difficult conversations are. When you can spot the trap, it’s easier to avoid it,” she says. Come armed with distractions, like group activities or games. But choose carefully – now is not the time for potentially controversial games like Cards Against Humanity. “Bring something innocuous or ridiculous to distract people, like trivia cards, a game or some music you want to share,” says Hoyton. At some point, you’ll probably need to vent about your family. Work out who you can lean on, which Blake describes as “gathering your troops”. This could be one person who understands your situation, or a WhatsApp chat with a group of friends – anything to “wrap as much kindness around you as you can”, says Blake. Also, think about who your allies are at the family gathering. “Have a code word for when you’re struggling,” suggests Hoyton. “So if you say, ‘Have we got any bourbon biscuits?’, you’re trying to say, ‘Can you get me out of the room?’” Plan some simple self-care activities that will make you feel good ahead of fraught interactions. Think about “how you can create some joy for yourself”, says Blake, whether that’s making your favourite meals or having a stack of great books to read. Rose echoes this and suggests eating nourishing food, limiting alcohol and getting outside for a walk or run, so that you “come into this situation feeling good about yourself”. “When researchers look at the different qualities of a relationship,” says Blake, “fewer than a quarter of people have those relationships we think of as the ideal – close, warm and supportive. There can be comfort in reminding yourself of what typical actually is.” Look back on previous interactions to “build realistic predictions” of what to expect – think about how you felt last time, what came up and what the trigger points were. According to Hoyton, we place greater expectations on family members than on friends, and should keep things realistic. “Accept that there are limitations in terms of how you get on with that person. Once you’ve made peace with that, your interactions will be different,” she says. If you’re dealing with relatives who you often argue with or who have opposing views to you, it can feel hard to set that aside. Hoyton suggests asking yourself: what do you want out of this? “Is it more important to try to change them, or do you just want to maintain family relations? You might not like them, but at least you’ll get through it.” Visualisations can be powerful, too, says Hoyton. Instead of thinking about things going wrong, visualise the situation in a positive way. Take some time to reflect on why you find these interactions difficult. “No one wants to spend time with someone who is vindictive, aggressive or judgmental, but when you’re thinking about this person, notice what comes up for you,” says Sturmer. “Those feelings might be anger, frustration, anxiety or embarrassment. Be curious about why they are there. Are they based in the present or the past? Are they rational?” This kind of reflective thinking can provide some perspective, suggests Sturmer. “Once we develop this type of self‑awareness, it can become much easier to understand – and sometimes challenge – our responses.” When talking to a tricky relative, consider their interests. “Think about what will appeal to them in order to diffuse the situation,” says Hoyton. You could ask about a holiday they’ve been on, or their new job. “You might not be remotely interested, so zone out by all means, but let them speak,” says Hoyton. Asking open questions will allow the other person to take the lead, advises Sturmer. “A simple ‘What’s new with you?’ or, ‘What have you been up to since we last got together?’ are the easiest ways to start. Responses like, ‘Tell me more about that’ or ‘How did you end up doing that?’ should keep the conversation flowing.” “It seems maddeningly simple but breathing can make a difference, and the research around it is strong. For example, marines are trained to go into box breathing to change their physiology quickly,” says Blake. Box breathing involves four steps, and you count to four for each one: inhale through your nose, hold your breath, exhale through your nose and then hold your breath. Sturmer is a fan of five‑finger breathing: “Use the index finger of one hand to trace up and down each finger of the other hand, inhaling slowly as you travel up, and exhaling as you move down.” When things get tense or you can feel your anxiety levels rocketing, Hoyton advises thinking about how you’re feeling on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being “I’m going to scream” and one being “I’m really laid back”. “Check in with yourself,” she says. “If it’s at a seven, think about what will get you to a six or a five. What do you need to do? Is it breathing? A distraction? Fresh air? All of those things are legitimate requests.” Sometimes the best way of avoiding conflict or stress is to remove yourself from the situation. “Make up a friend that’s going to call you, so you can say: ‘Oh, I just remembered, I’m supposed to speak to Hannah,’” says Hoyton. Rose also recommends thinking about ways to “politely extricate yourself from situations”. She adds: “If you feel things getting heated, find a reason to move away, like going to the bathroom or putting the kettle on. Give yourself a bit of space to calm down.” Apps like Calm and Headspace can be handy in these moments, for quick meditations and breathing exercises. “If you avoid the argument, then you don’t get into a situation where everybody’s wound up,” says Rose. If you’re feeling angry or upset during a family gathering, try to practise self-compassion, says Blake. “Appreciate that these moments of anger, hurt, disconnection or isolation are common in family relationships, so let’s not shame ourselves for having them.” She recommends looking up Dr Kristin Neff, who specialises in self‑compassion and with various resources. “She has exercises where you place your hand on your heart, give yourself a reassuring, affirmative, gentle touch, and say things like: ‘This is a moment of struggle, and this is a common struggle.’ It can be helpful.” After a fraught few days with family, you might find you can’t stop thinking about how things went. In these moments, it can help to put pen to paper. “If something evokes anxiety in us, we can keep chewing it over and become obsessive. When you write it down, it’s a way of getting it out of your head. What did you experience? What were the feelings? What helped you?” says Hoyton. Sturmer agrees. “There’s a lot of evidence to show that articulating our feelings in a journal can help us to feel less anxious,” she says. If you’re reeling from the time spent with your family, or you feel you keep repeating the same patterns with them, therapy might help. “Therapy offers a space where you can get to grips with how you feel and how you respond to other people, without fear of judgment,” says Sturmer. “I’m always keen to get to the roots of why we feel the way that we do, to notice why we respond to certain people or situations in certain ways, where these feelings come from, and what it might be like for things to be different.” This could be short-term therapy or a single session, says Rose. “Even a short amount of time spent talking things through can be helpful.” Once the dust has settled, it might be worth digging into exactly what happened and what your role was. “If you’ve stormed into a family environment and created a fuss, sometimes it is about apologising and recognising where you’ve gone wrong, or your part in this interaction,” says Rose. It could be that there was nothing you could do to make things better – in which case, acknowledge that too: “Sometimes, family members are just difficult. Recognise that nothing you do will change the situation, and focus on what you can control, which is your own actions.” “Lean into the things that make you feel good and like yourself,” says Blake. “Connect with your troops – those people with whom you feel safe.” Blake suggests being very intentional with how you spend the days afterwards, whether that’s making plans to speak to people on the phone or see them in person, or getting back into your regular routine and doing hobbies you enjoy. “Seek out the people and places that make your nervous system feel relaxed,” she says.",Isabelle Aron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/my-big-night-out-danced-alone-nightclub,My big night out: I danced alone in a nightclub – and realised I could make my own good time,2025-12-26T13:00:09.000Z,"I had gone out with friends to mark the end of university, and one by one they disappeared. With the music throbbing, I learned I could be comfortable in my own company etween the ages of 16 and 21, the big night out wasn’t just a hobby, it was a calling. Getting together with friends, getting drunk, being blasted by music, meeting new friends in the smoking area, getting more drunk, somehow making it home eight hours later – these were things I excelled at, the precious moments where I could try to lose myself and avoid the anxiety that inevitably came with daybreak. The escapism wasn’t just selfish fun. It felt like a necessary avoidance of reality, which for me consisted of having a mother with a terminal illness who would die when I was 19, leaving me at university to cope with my grief. Going out, dancing and chatting rubbish to friends was one way to survive. I never usually went out alone, as that would mean being forced to engage with my thoughts and emotions. Except for one humid summer’s night in 2014 when I was 21, with my university years coming to a close and the prospect of moving back in with my widowed dad fast approaching: I found myself on a big night out with no company. The night was intended as one last blowout with friends before I was due to move out of my university digs in Bristol and, hopefully, enter the adult world. Five of us travelled to a warehouse on the outskirts of town to see the dub-influenced producer the Bug play with the MC Flowdan. But the pre-game shots and drinking games must have been especially potent because, by the time we arrived, one of the group was denied entry for being too drunk. The rest of us carried on until another of the group left for the smoking area, found someone to snog and never came back. That left me with a couple who were renowned over the three years of their university relationship for erupting into explosive rows. This final night was no different. I left for the loo and by the time I was back, they had begun bickering, then shouting at each other, before ultimately storming off into the street. Left to my own devices, I finished my drink and felt a simmering anxiety begin to creep in. I fidgeted and was just about to leave when it hit me – a sound so loud and menacing it felt like the music was reaching inside to rearrange my organs. My knees quivered and the fillings in my molars rattled. This was the Bug finally coming on stage with his signature bass pressure, a noise so intense it seemed dangerous. I felt the flickering of a fight-or-flight response, but with foam earplugs soon shoved in, confused and aurally overloaded, I stood and began to sway to the rhythm while the thoughts I had been avoiding bubbled up: what would I do for work? How would I survive back in the family home? What was I meant to do with my life now my mum was gone? Rather than panic, though, the aggression of the music – its sheer loudness – started to scream back at the fear I was feeling. It was strange and compelling, and the longer I stayed, the more I began to feel tolerant of that discomfort – of the volume and of my fears. I could withstand the intensity, I realised, and maybe even enjoy it. I stayed for a few hours, sweating and dancing on my own, and made it home exhausted. I didn’t suddenly have a revelation that I was healed or that life would always be OK. I just found myself letting those thoughts and feelings emerge for the first time, rather than always trying to run away from them. The next morning, with my ears ringing, I felt a tiny jolt of excitement about the uncertainty that lay ahead of me – even if it meant moving back into my childhood bedroom. In the decade since that night out, I have become increasingly comfortable in my own company, and with those lingering thoughts that emerge when I’m alone. I would usually prefer to spend nights out with friends, but sometimes I seek out time by myself. It can be precious, poignant or silly fun, and I now know that if everyone else happens to disappear again, I can still dance and make my own good time.",Ammar Kalia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common reasons for book challenges: objections to sexual content and themes around race and racism, LGBTQ+ and other social justice issues.

Many times, books don’t even get to that stage when library workers are forbidden from buying them or required to place them in restricted areas – some states have passed laws that pre-censor books with so-called “controversial” themes.

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/21/cycling-changing-at-speed-britain-keeping-pace,Cycling is changing at speed – but is Britain keeping pace?,2025-12-21T10:00:04.000Z,"Emulating the bike-friendly highways enjoyed by our continental neighbours  will take a lot more money and political will ver since Team GB’s velodrome successes at the 2008 Olympics, campaigners and government ministers have confidently predicted that Britain is about to become a nation of cyclists. There is just one problem: for the most part, it has not happened. Apart from a very concentrated spike in bike use during Covid, the level of cycle trips in England has for years, and things do not appear to be changing. lowest annual sales of its eponymous folding bikes since 2021. Statistics from the Bicycle Association, the trade body for the bike industry in Britain, , fewer conventional bikes were bought than in any other year this century. “If you look at the sales of pedal cycles since 2010, there isn’t a year except the Covid year when sales haven’t declined. I’m always puzzled that people in the industry aren’t more alarmed about that,” says Phillip Darnton, executive chair of the Bicycle Association. It is, however, not a picture of unqualified gloom. London is experiencing a , now at nearly 1.5m trips a day, 43% higher than 2019. A handful of other places have seen increases in bike use, albeit less spectacularly. Buried within this mix of statistics are a handful of apparent lessons. To find them, it helps first to think about the different types of cyclists on our roads. Leisure riders – the fabled middle-aged pedallers snaking through the Surrey Hills or Peak District in DayGlo Lycra come rain or shine – can only ever be a small part of what makes a cycling nation. Others include those who cycle every day for transport, and experts agree these people will only cycle if they feel it is safe, which requires long-term investment in infrastructure. Finally, with the advent of ebikes and dockless hire networks such as Lime, cycling is changing at speed – but some say the government is not, as yet, keeping pace. Adam Tranter, who runs a PR agency that works with cycling brands and was formerly the walking and cycling commissioner for the West Midlands, points to the gradual shift in higher-end bike sales from traditional road bikes to so-called gravel bikes, designed to be ridden off-road, and to sophisticated indoor trainers, where people race against each other virtually. “All this is a code for people saying, ‘I don’t like being near cars as I don’t feel safe’,” he says. “Whichever way you look at it, you can’t reach the potential of cycling without making it much more safe and hospitable to cycle. It all comes down to that basic fact.” While Westminster governments have see-sawed between a relative enthusiasm for cycling under Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer to the of Rishi Sunak, in contrast, London has seen more than two decades of support under the mayoralties of Ken Livingstone, Johnson and then Sadiq Khan. “For things to really change you need strong, consistent political leadership over a sustained period of time,” a senior figure in the cycle policy world says. “If you have consistent investment you can also attract and keep the talent and skills you need to make cycling work in somewhere as ancient and tightly packed as . These people aren’t easy to find.” London does, of course, also have a concentrated population and disincentives to driving, including the congestion charge and a network of low-traffic neighbourhoods in many boroughs. As anyone who has been in London recently will know, as well as growing in size, the swarms of cyclists are also changing in type, including more people on electric-assist bikes, including hire versions such as the ubiquitous Lime models. Within this are a distinct breed of machine: often startlingly rapid electric contraptions powered by vast rear-wheel hub motors and a collection of zip-tied batteries, many ridden by gig economy riders for delivery companies. These are not ebikes, which are strictly defined by law. They are in effect a form of electric motorbike, entirely illegal but rarely challenged by police. “It’s a massive image problem for cycling because more or less everyone conflates the two things,” Tranter says. “You could tackle this more or less overnight by forcing delivery companies to make checks, for example monitoring riders’ speeds. But it seems we’d rather just moan about it.” This new technological world means sales of conventional bikes are falling throughout Europe. The difference is that in many other countries, the balance is being made up by sales of legal ebikes. Darnton says: “This year, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain will sell more than 5m electric bikes between them. We might be lucky if we sell 150,000 here.” Much of this is down to other countries having safer road conditions for cycling, plus subsidies to help people buy sometimes expensive ebikes, the sort of scheme thus far only applied to electric cars and motorbikes in the UK. But beyond this, ebikes have something of an image problem, something shaped by a mix of personal experience or media coverage. Tranter says: “With hire bikes, the issue is mainly their sheer popularity – as numbers grow so does the number of idiots, like any other transport mode. But we have ended up with their popularity being seen as a problem to solve, not a huge success story for active mobility.” Added to this is the near-unchecked use of illegal electric bikes, many made in China, which are often dangerously quick and, unlike legal models, can have Darnton says: “People read that ebikes are dangerous and they believe it. And if your landlord says you can’t bring it on to the property, or your employer says you can’t park it in the underground car park, which is increasingly the case, then you won’t get one. “In London, if you ask someone under about 35 if they are thinking of buying a bike they’ll say, ‘Why? I’ve got one at the end of the road.’ He adds: “Existential is this rather ghastly word, but it’s true: unless we can do what Europe does, what is going to happen to the UK cycle market is it’s going to be a leisure market, like golf or tennis or badminton or anything else.”",Peter Walker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You know what to expect from a Wes Anderson picture by now: surreal plots, detailed sets and deadpan performances from a preposterously starry cast. His latest has all those, but adds a giddy quest narrative involving dodgy tycoon Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio Del Toro) and his Catholic novice daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton) on a fund-raising trip for his epic infrastructure project. There are assassins, love stories, political brouhaha – and a handy box of hand grenades. Ridiculous but entertaining. A fascinating double bill could be fashioned from Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla, screening on the BBC next week, and Baz Luhrmann’s flamboyant biopic of the beloved hip-swiveller. Austin Butler is suitably magnetic as Presley, though the film is just as interested in his manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks, with a sort-of Dutch accent and a prosthetic hooter), who guides and manipulates his rock’n’roll cash cow. Their Svengali-like relationship drives the film, while Luhrmann, a master of the musical set-piece, gives Elvis’s performances a real kick. Followed by Chelsea v Aston Villa at 5pm on Sky Sports Main Event. Three third-round matches at Alexandra Palace in London. Including the Desert Orchid Chase, plus the Welsh Grand National from Chepstow. Followed by Bath v Northampton at 5.15pm. Day three of the fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground.",Hollie Richardson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether you’re already rural or are escaping a city, spending NYE in the countryside is the perfect excuse to cosplay Downton Abbey with your favourite . For added drama, try bold colours and accessories that sparkle in candlelight. (For what to wear for a morning-after yomp, see below).

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/dec/23/the-highgate-vampire-review-omnibus-theatre-cockpit,The Highgate Vampire review – stranger-than-fiction events make for biting comedy,2025-12-23T06:00:48.000Z,"Sweet and funny show is based on rumoured vampire sightings in north London in the 1960s and 70s – though it could do with producing a few more goosebumps or a time in the late 1960s and early 70s, the area around Highgate cemetery in north London was believed to be terrorised by a vampire. There were sightings, exorcisms, illicit grave excavations and even some desecrations. At the frenzied height of the speculation, the local police force got involved. In real-life events that sound like the stuff of Hammer horror (indeed, the Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer horror film was apparently inspired by the incident), two men, David Farrant and Sean Manchester, got involved in hopes of solving the case. But rather than becoming a Holmes and Watson of the supernatural dimension, they embarked on a bitterly fought contest to be the first to vanquish the vampire, each undermining the other man’s authority along the way. Here, Patrick Sheffield (Alexander Knott) is a bishop in robes and cassock while Daniel Farringdon (James Demain) is a tobacconist by day and vampire hunter by night. Written by Demain and Knott, this hour-long comedy is shaped as a lecture which both men try to lead, each wrestling the narrative from the other, stopping, starting, disagreeing, and involving even their lecture’s technician, Audrey (played by Zöe Grain, who is also the show’s projection designer and producer). She apparently creates creepy sound effects in key moments of their testimonies (the sound design and musical composition is in fact by Samuel Heron) and enthusiastically shakes her maraca by the side of the stage during a musical number. Directed by Ryan Hutton, this is surprisingly sweet meta-theatre that zips along like a sketch. The men comically transform into various eye-witnesses and there are some funny lines about Karl Marx, who is famously buried in Highgate cemetery. It is charmingly performed although it could afford to be both sharper and scarier. You feel some goosebumps, such as during the account given by a teenage girl who spots a red-eyed “entity” in the dark that holds her in a vampiric trance – but you wish for more of such moments to contrast the breezy comedy. Still, it is an amusing alternative to a Christmas ghost story, all the more outrageous for its stranger-than-fiction roots. Could it be even creepier as a promenade, site-specific show? , until 30 December, then at , from 28 January until 1 February",Arifa Akbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the built-in features and easily available additional apps, there are plenty of clever things you can do with your smartphone. The iPhone’s Measure app uses augmented reality and the device’s camera to calculate everything from ceiling heights to room dimensions – handy for those DIY tasks that require a quick decision. And, good news for parents, also points out that you can use it to measure a person’s height: the digital equivalent of etched markings on the wall. Metal detectors cost a pretty penny, but many modern devices have built-in magnetometers designed to help improve the accuracy of GPS within apps. Those magnetometers are also used in metal detectors, and some apps can harness that tech to detect metal. These apps are never going to be as accurate as tailor-made products, but if you are looking for a way to entertain the kids on a day at the beach, they will more than suffice in seeking out small bits of treasure. Lost the television remote down the back of the sofa again? Many phones include an infrared blaster that can mimic the signals from your TV, set-top box or air-conditioning remote, while others can talk to smart devices over wifi or Bluetooth. Download a remote control app, point your phone at the screen, and you can adjust the volume, switch inputs or change channels. Link in smart lights, speakers and streaming sticks and your handset becomes a control centre for the whole living room … though it does make it easier for teenagers to prank you by changing channel mid-episode. Got a load of old photographic negatives that you never got round to having developed – or worse, lost the prints for? such as FilmBox, available on iOS and Android, can turn your negatives into digital photos (provided you shine light through them). Even better, you can then use image-editing apps to fine-tune the colour balance on old, washed-out pics. Some companies now offer a callback service so you don’t have to stay on hold for ages, but if they don’t, you can use your phone to do the same thing. The , available on iPhones running iOS 26, gives you a notification when it hears a human voice on the other end of the line, so you can get back to work safe in the knowledge you won’t miss your turn. Newer iPhones and some Android handsets have depth sensors such as lidar (light detection and ranging) that can map the world in 3D. Install a scanning app, slowly walk around the object or room you want to capture, and your phone will stitch those readings into a detailed 3D model. You can then export it for 3D printing, game design or simply to keep a precise digital copy of bulky items before you sell or recycle them. It is also a neat way to document the contents of a rented flat for insurance purposes, or capture awkward corners when planning renovations. If you are an outdoorsy type, phones can help keep you on key routes and out of danger. Make sure you download offline maps before you go somewhere remote, and your phone’s GPS will still work without reception. Hiking and cycling apps can track your route, elevation and distance, then save it so you can retrace your steps – or share it with friends later. Combined with smartwatches, smartphones have become a boon for those wanting to keep track of their health, but it’s possible to go even further. A to see whether a smartphone’s microphone could accurately measure heartbeats – similar to how a stethoscope works – demonstrated that “mobile technologies are a ”. A commercial “cardiac screening tool” app is Some people spend money on white noise machines and then cart them around in their suitcase when they are travelling. But it’s possible to achieve the same benefit with your iPhone. Simply go to the accessibility section in your device’s settings, then tap on audio & visual. You can then turn on a variety of sounds, from white noise to ocean waves to crackling fire, to lull you to sleep. Trying to repaint a wall without the original tin to hand can feel impossible. Instead of juggling paper swatches, use your phone’s camera and a colour-matching app to sample the shade directly from the wall, or cushion, or curtain, or whatever you like. The software will suggest the closest equivalents from major paint ranges, and some apps also let you preview those colours on a photo of your space, combining paint matching and augmented reality in one go. On a foreign holiday and not sure what to eat or where to go? Live translation capabilities in apps such as Translate mean that it need not all be Greek to you. A combination of image recognition and live translation tools can identify foreign symbols and transpose English-language translations over the top of them, so you should never end up with an unexpected surprise for dinner. Not sure what is growing along your boundary wall, or what kind of cactus you have just bought? AI-powered insights from your smartphone’s camera lens can identify plants, animals and other objects, with surprising accuracy. Specialist apps abound for identifying plants, but the catch-all service provided by Google Lens is a surprisingly accurate way to distinguish your hydrangeas from your hosteas. Built-in cameras on all but the most expensive laptops and PCs are low-resolution and cope poorly in low-light conditions, meaning you’re blighted with the curse of blurry Zoom calls. Smartphone cameras are way more souped-up, and have automated processing that constantly tries to improve your image quality, making them ideal for replacing your webcam. On iPhones and Mac computers, you need to . On Android devices and Windows, follow the instructions in the “Link to Windows” app to set it up. If you have noisy neighbours or need to keep track of how much noise builders are subjecting you to, a slew of decibel-measuring apps are available. They are surprisingly accurate thanks to plenty of training, and some councils will even encourage complainants to download them and log intrusions if they are in dispute with neighbours. Near-field communication (NFC) is mostly associated with tap-to-pay transactions, but cheap NFC stickers (you can get 50 for less than £10 online) can act as programmable buttons for your life. Stick one by the front door and set your phone to turn on the wifi and lights when you tap it; put another on your bedside table to start a sleep playlist and enable Do Not Disturb. With a little experimentation, you can build simple smart home routines without buying a hub. If you have ever hung a picture, stepped back and realised it is slightly wonky, your phone can spare you constant tinkering. Many handsets include a built-in spirit level tucked away in the compass or measurement tools. Lay your phone on the top edge of a frame or shelf and it will show when you have hit level, down to a fraction of a degree. It’s ideal, too, for levelling bookshelves, curtain poles and even sorting out a wonky table leg. Buying a house or getting a mortgage often involves having to sign contracts. Some companies will let you do this digitally, but if you are someone who prefers putting pen to paper, you can still do so – with the help of your device. Even most entry-level smartphones now include functions that allow you to turn a photograph into a perfectly serviceable scan by pinpointing the corners of a document when you hover your camera over it. Family prints stashed in shoe boxes don’t have to remain static. Scan them into your phone and apps, including Google Photos and Apple Photos, and shots can automatically be grouped by people, places and dates, then stitched into short “memories” complete with music and transitions. Some tools even add subtle motion effects to still images, making them feel more like miniature films than dusty snapshots. Health apps increasingly tap into sensors on your phone or connected watch to estimate blood oxygen saturation, a useful signal for issues such as breathing difficulties or altitude sickness. While they aren’t a replacement for clinical-grade monitors, they can function as an early warning system, highlighting unusual trends over time and prompting you to seek medical advice if something looks off, rather than ignoring a nagging feeling. Ditch the dodgy clickers and install the companion app for PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Slides, and you can control your presentation remotely, swiping between slides and seeing your speaker notes on your handset. Some apps turn the screen into a virtual laser pointer, letting you highlight key details on a big display while roaming the stage, instead of being tethered to a laptop. At a pinch, you can even mirror your phone’s screen to a TV or projector and present straight from the handset if your main computer misbehaves. Most phones let you share your real-time location with trusted friends or family for a set length of time through apps such as WhatsApp. It is a low-effort safety net when walking home at night, travelling alone, or meeting someone new, and beats the old “text me when you get there” ritual. For those who want to monitor what they are eating, phones make food diaries far less of a faff. Nutrition apps enable you to scan barcodes or search databases to log meals, automatically tallying calories and nutrients across the day. Many sync with your step counter or smartwatch, so you can see the balance between what is going in and what you are burning off, without being nose-deep in a spreadsheet. They are just as useful for people trying to eat more fibre, reduce salt or spot foods that trigger symptoms as they are for anyone counting calories. With a cheap plug-in microphone and a basic editing app, your phone can record and trim surprisingly high-quality audio. It’s enough to start a podcast, capture interviews on the go or simply send better-than-voice-note updates to friends and family. Want to take a photo just by saying “click”? You can create voice-activated commands for your iPhone in the accessibility section – although it’s not super-straightforward. Tap on voice control > commands > custom, then select “create new command”. From there, you can type in a voice trigger (such as “click”), which then takes you into a recording of your screen. Everything you tap (like jabbing where the camera button is) will then be repeated whenever you say that phrase. So now when you open your camera and say “click”, hey presto! This can be useful, for automating all manner of repetitive tasks, although it only works when voice control is activated. Paper scribbles stuck to the fridge are no match for dedicated shopping list apps. Apps such as Bring!, AnyList or Listonic let you share a live list with housemates or partners, tick off items in real time as you walk the aisles, and even add products by scanning barcodes or importing ingredients directly from online recipes.",Chris Stokel-Walker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coming up is the panto. On other days, it may be anything from language lessons to arts and crafts. Today in this multipurpose venue, it is the turn of the annual Christmas fair, with its bric-a-brac stalls, grotto and tree. Sitting on four sides of the elegant ballroom in Chadderton town hall, a refuge for , we require no leap of the imagination to picture ourselves at a genuine local fundraiser. That gives Jim Cartwright’s 2012 play a built-in sense of community. Director Jimmy Fairhurst keeps the house lights up, save for the most poignant speeches, and expects us to clap along to the Christmas hits and cheer the young carol singers as if they were children of our own. Blurring the fact/fiction divide, the interval is less a break in the action than a chance to buy the scented candles and prints by Oldham artists that are otherwise part of the set. The site-specific hall has its disadvantages. The acoustics are poor and the focus bounces unpredictably around the space, sucking the life out of Cartwright’s jokes. Surprisingly for Fairhurst, whose Not Too Tame company specialises in boisterous entertainment and direct address, there is little audience interaction. But there is a chaotic appeal in the playwright’s structural conceit. The show opens with the caretaker (Lee Toomes) sweeping up an empty space which, with the arrival of bossy Veronica (Samantha Robinson), enthusiast Lucy (Kelise Gordon-Harrison), the vicar (Dickon Tyrrell) and lefty writer Johnny (Paddy Stafford), gradually fills with tables laden with trinkets, toys and teddy bears. Before the night is through, it will all be cleared away again. It is not exactly , the wordless Belgian show that built a whole house on stage, but it has a pleasing materiality. A breezy first half contrasts with a weightier second, in which the characters take turns to reveal their demons in aria-like soliloquies. The speeches are dramatically inert, back-story reflections instead of present-tense action, but heartfelt for all that. Bathed in goodwill-to-all-men sentiment and acted with charm, it amounts to a slight but wholesome seasonal alternative.",Mark Fisher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most people go to the woods in search of flowers, birds, insects or fungi, but I was looking for moss. Why moss? What is so special about this irksome plant you find hidden in plain sight? The Forest of Dean could be synonymous with moss. When I went, I was immediately struck by the amount there was. It was covering rocks, trees, the ground – everything! Everywhere was camouflaged by this blanket of green. It was like looking through emerald glasses. I ran my hand over a patch of moss; it was soft and velvety like a puppy’s fur. There are between 15,000 and 25,000 species of (which includes mosses, liverworts and hornworts), making it one of the most diverse plant groups in the world. There are so many amazing things about moss, like how it can survive in extreme conditions – dormant moss has been known to survive temperatures from -272C to 100C, and the spores can be in space for months without dying. Moss has been around for 450m years, enduring drastic climate changes. Mosses also hold moisture, help the soil to prevent erosion, and absorb pollution from the air. It makes me wonder why we neglect and ignore these magnificent plants, especially when we find it in our own garden patios.

It’s a clear, cold night, and the inn couldn’t look more welcoming: a cosy glow from within the historic building, the Cowal hills beyond. The Christmas lights are twinkling, the glasses are charged and there’s a palpable sense of goodwill, cheer, and plenty of pride in the air. By 6pm, it’s buzzing. Locals are already propping up the bar as a stylish woman sweeps in and bags the last table. She is Debbie Rycroft, a local haberdasher. “A pint in my own local,” she smiles happily, relishing a toast with her husband and equally dapper 19-year-old son. First-night hiccups are limited to a wonky nozzle and a brief worry about a small radiator leak. “How many people to fix a heater?” quips someone as a line of concerned faces survey the scene. Almost immediately, a punter walks in with a radiator key. All sorted. Someone orders a Guinness; the bartender pulls it off. A two-part pour, pitchblack perfection with a balanced, creamy top. Good things come to those who wait? Well, this one’s been three years in the making. The Oakbank, a landmark building at the heart of Sandbank for the last 160 years, closed at the end of 2022, like so many businesses that struggled in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Next came the closure of the nearby Holy Loch inn. The village was left without a pub – a huge loss for a rural community. A group of locals got together in early 2023, formed a committee, chaired by Sue McKillop, and began the long slog to buy the Oakbank. “It’s been an uphill struggle,” says Ian MacNaughton, another founding committee member. “I just didn’t think the hill would be so steep!” Now retired, MacNaughton remembers sneaking into the Oakbank for a pint, aged 16. These days he’s learning about compliance laws. “We must do everything right.” After an initial rejection, their persistence finally paid off last December with the award of a Scottish Land grant just shy of £150,000, covering most of the purchase price. In January, McKillop advertised shares, raising more than £23,000 and an “inspiring amount of enthusiasm” from locals. By April this year, they had the keys. It’s been nonstop ever since up until opening night last Saturday, she says. While the shares didn’t reach the £90,000 target, people have contributed “thousands of volunteer hours” to get the place ready, Dawn Petherick tells me. They shifted and updated the bar, now an airy sky blue, while the old wood burner’s still there but “needing work”. Another one for the list. And Petherick’s list is long. She is Oakbank’s development officer, a fixed-term post funded by the initial grant, and, like everyone else involved, she’s been busy all year. The Oakbank has been running pop-ups, workshops and charity mornings during the refurbishment. More events are being added all the time. “Whatever the community wants – knitting groups, book clubs, exhibitions, ‘sober nights’ – it should be a hub more than a pub,” says Petherick. “Somewhere to alleviate social isolation.” And that is needed more than ever. Yet another local pub, the Strone Inn across the bay, is set to close at the end of the year. Like many local business owners, Stephen Mitchell is supportive of the Oakbank project. “Fair play to them,” he says. “It’s taken them three years, so it’s a real result.” But, he warns, “the hard work starts now as things are really tough”. McKillop agrees. “It’s exciting but a wee bit scary,” she says. “We are under no illusions as to the challenges that lie ahead. Like any pub venue, we will need to keep innovating in order to survive.” But she can take comfort from recent figures; community pubs are doing well. According to the charity Plunkett UK, community-owned businesses are “highly resilient”, with a five-year survival rate of 98%. “We’re delighted that the Oakbank Community Inn is opening under community ownership,” says James Alcock, Plunkett UK’s chief executive. “We see time and again how saving local assets like village pubs protects vital services and social spaces, helping to reduce isolation and strengthen communities.” Future plans include refurbishing accommodation upstairs, a studio/gallery space in the adjoining cottage and renovating the commercial kitchen. In a nice piece of alchemy, the pub sits opposite Sandbank’s community-owned garden, so its polytunnels and raised beds will be nurturing hyper-local vegetables destined for that kitchen. But the best thing about the Oakbank is the bit you see last. At the back of the bar, big glass doors offer views across the Holy Loch. It’s inaccessible now, but outside the doors, a grassy verge leads to the Holy Loch marina below. It has its own regulars hauling out on the slipway – giant Atlantic grey seals. With neighbours like that, you can see why McKillop has ambitious plans. “We’re going to rebuild the rotten deck and make a bridge to connect to the marina,” she says. That should please boat-owners Tony, Rob and Alan, enjoying a pint beside the bar. “Sailors don’t like going places where you can’t go to a pub,” says Rob. “And Sandbank’s had absolutely nothing to offer.” “Hang on,” offers Tony. “It’s got a lot of history.” But Rob’s having none of it. “You can’t drink a pint of history.”",Susan Smillie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That should surely now be unconditional. Cutting has risen, almost to the top, and 2025 has been a . This enthusiastically performed and received recital, a world away from the general run of pre-Christmas concerts or countertenor recitals, and accompanied by the eclectically matched eight-strong Refound Ensemble, showed why. Themed recitals are common, but Cutting’s programme of songs and music, all connected to the theme of night, was built on levels of thought and performative imagination that few such programmes would even attempt, much less bring off. The pieces ranged from the baroque to the brand new, via Schubert, folk song and Don McLean. Few familiar pieces on the programme were played as written, with Cutting preferring arrangements mostly by members of the ensemble. It was compelling from first to last, more cabaret than concert. The calms and charms of night came first. Even here, though, there was instant originality in a lilting Auden setting by Geoffrey Burgon, once famous for the Nunc Dimittis from the BBC’s 1970s Le Carré adaptations. Then, without a break, as was most of the programme, we had Endymion’s soulful song to the moon from Cavalli’s La Calisto and Purcell’s Fairy Queen aria hymning the pleasures of the night, to which Cutting’s lustrous countertenor was ideally suited. Of the two premieres, Piers Connor Kennedy’s Morpheus, a dark and expressive Rupert Brooke setting, was particularly successful, crisply scored and sung with nice subtlety. Elena Langer’s Fabulous Beasts, settings of medieval lyrics about birds and beasts, linked by virtuosic clarinet playing by Magdalenna Krstevska, was odder and quirkier, but too disjointed. Oberon’s “Welcome, wanderer!” from Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream was done in a brilliant arrangement that captured all the transgressive eeriness of the score. Then a darker and more dramatic turn, with Schubert’s Erlkönig and Richard Rodney Bennett’s Baby, Baby, Naughty Baby each unleashing alarming nocturnal demons. Don McLean’s gentle 1970 song Vincent, sung by Cutting in baritone, trod the same knife-edge in a different way. The black humour of William Bolcom’s ghoulish Black Max was terrifically done, and Weill’s Speak Low was a seductive reminder at the end that the night is also made for love.",Martin Kettle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ever-popular underwater adventures of the amiable yellow sponge continue, with a fourth big-screen adventure that sees SpongeBob tracking down the Flying Dutchman (Mark Hamill). Expect to see just as many child-free millennials in the audience as families. Apologies to anyone who views it through rose-tinted spectacles, but the original 1997 Anaconda was a load of drivel. But this isn’t a faithful remake: it’s a meta-horror-comedy-action remake about a couple of guys (Jack Black and Paul Rudd) attempting to remake Anaconda only to be attacked by – yes – a giant snake. OK, we’ll bite. Joachim Trier explores the dynamic between an actor daughter and her director father (Stellan Skarsgård) in this comic drama. It stars Renate Reinsve and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas as sisters whose dad re-enters their lives, attempting attempting to film his own autobiographical script. Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations get an alt-rock twist thanks to Isle of Wight weirdos Wet Leg, who bring summer’s second album, Moisturizer, to the Scottish capital. Support comes from local acts Hamish Hawk and Lucia & the Best Boys, but the show may well be stolen by pyrotechnic wizards Titanium’s midnight firework display. Electronic music experimentalist Samuel Shepherd, AKA Floating Points, rings in the new year with this all-night set in east London. A noted crate-digger whose albums have flitted between jazzy soundscapes, chunky basslines and hard club drops, it’s best not to second guess what might happen. In 1947, bebop trumpet star Dizzy Gillespie wrote Manteca, the first-ever Afro-Cuban tune to become a jazz hit – thereby unleashing the Latin jazz genre. This northern piano trio of the same name devotedly explores that lineage, via the music of Dizzy, Herbie Hancock, Wes Montgomery and many others. JS Bach supplies the programme for New Year’s Eve at the Wigmore as the countertenor joins the English Concert for a programme that alternates solo cantatas with two of the Brandenburg Concertos, Nos 3 and 6; it’s directed by Lars Ulrik Mortensen, the hall’s new artist in residence. There’s a raucous party atmosphere, laced with hungover melancholy, in this epic and often hilarious tour through the world of Gilbert & George. It is at once a very small place, as they obsessively explore their east London locality, and a window on a world riven with conflict and fear. Crisp clear winter nights with a full moon hanging, bright silver haunt this exhibition. A man digs by moonlight, a gathering in a Georgian house is entranced by a scientific experiment, a couple of travellers chance on a dark secret. The storms and gusts of winter whirl about you in this annual unveiling of the great Romantic artist’s watercolours. Turner can bathe you in the warmth of an Italian summer and take you into the ice-laden Alps. There’s no better artist to show you beauty in the chills of January. Shake yourself out of the Christmas torpor, grab your surfboard and plunge in the shivering sea … at least in imagination, with this survey of how Cornwall became a wave-riding hotspot. The museum also has a Christmas trail and crafts for kids. David Ireland’s latest play starts at 6.30pm and lasts just 45 minutes. It’s about a young woman who’s been sleeping with strangers across Scotland and an American tourist she meets. What are they hiding? Director Tom Littler’s 250th-anniversary production of Sheridan’s “comedy of manners” is set in 1920s Bath, – where the production later tours – with a cracking cast including Robert Bathurst and Patricia Hodge. Birmingham Royal Ballet makes its annual trip south for a Nutcracker spectacle that should leave everyone feeling warm and sparkly. Choreographed by Sir Peter Wright, it has projections by the acclaimed 59 Productions that fill the vast space, and Tchaikovsky’s brilliant score played live by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia. See out 2025 without a second bout of serious reflection in the company of two of Manchester’s finest standups – the bracingly acerbic Fairburn and the warmly gossipy Jones – as they co-headline end of year shows in their home city. It’s been 10 years since this sumptuous John le Carré adaptation first wowed viewers; now the spy series is making a belated comeback, this time shifting the arms-dealing action to Colombia. Tom Hiddleston returns as the inscrutable former soldier turned hotel manager turned undercover agent. If you’re still reeling from the Celebrity Traitors finale, then pull yourself together: it’s time for another civilian version. Prepare for a whole new host of clueless hundies to fail to root out the barefaced liars in their midst as our best reality format returns to deliver more deliciously twisted sociology lessons. You know exactly what you’re getting with a Harlan Coben thriller: an irresistible mystery peppered with plot holes, red herrings and terrible dialogue. Yet these trashy dramas invariably boast quality casts. Run Away, about a drug-addicted teenager who goes missing, stars Ruth Jones, Minnie Driver, Ingrid Oliver, Amy Gledhill and many more. SNL has already spoofed this ludicrously camp drama about a group of glamorous gun-wielding Texan women who welcome a newcomer with a dark secret into their fold, and the murder and mayhem that unsurprisingly ensues. Malin Akerman, Brittany Snow and Dermot Mulroney star. Looking back again at some gaming classics, why not leap and swing through a festive New York City complete with glittering decorations and snow-laden avenues? This is the best of all Spider-Man’s outings to date. The first entry in this leisurely adventure series sees you play detective in sleepy 1980s Yokosuka streets, with snowy weather creeping in with each passing December day.

South Korean singer and producer the Deep cashes in on the current passion for all thing 00s with this debut of neon-splashed, trucker cap-sporting party rock. With production assistance from hyperpop’s Dorian Electra, songs such as BEEP BEEP and the Kesha-like title track are gloriously throwaway dance-pop. Prolific 21-year-old Kai Slater, the frontman of Chicago band Lifeguard, releases his second album of 2025. While Balloon Balloon Balloon continues the jangly powerpop majesty of March’s Radio DDR, it also expands on his sound, adding experimental textures to songs such as the cut-and-shut opus I Could Find Out. Huge in their native Australia, where all five of their previous albums have hit the Top 10, indie rock quintet Boy & Bear return with this follow-up to 2023’s self-titled record. As the title suggests, it’s an album anchored by the passing of time and self-growth. As a musician, actor, author and one-time member of the Lemonheads and Blake Babies, singer-songwriter Juliana Hatfield has worn a lot of hats. She’s also found the time to record 21 solo albums. On Lightning Might Strike she perfectly bottles melodic indie rock, particularly on Fall Apart and Popsicle.

https://www.theguardian.com/mcdonalds-myths-busted/2025/dec/11/is-mcdonalds-beef-really-100-percent-the-myth-explained,The making of a myth: is McDonald’s meat really 100% beef?,2025-12-11T13:07:59.000Z,"When it comes to the food industry, urban legends abound. Here, we examine some widely shared, but false, claims about McDonald’s beef – and give you the chance to put your patty-cooking skills to the test McDonald’s beef patties aren’t made with 100% beef because they contain all kinds of nasty stuff and fake fillers. Until McDonald’s arrived in the UK in 1974, beef was largely considered something of a luxury, reserved for Sunday roasts or once-a-year sirloin steak dinners. Rationing had ended only 20 years before; the convenience and affordability of McDonald’s led some to speculate that the meat was low-quality. With few restaurants talking about food provenance in the 1970s, urban legends emerged that “odd bits” of meat – leftover parts such as organs and bones – were ground into the patties, along with “fillers” like oatmeal. “There’s always been an assumption because fast food is affordable, people think it equals cutting costs – but that’s just not how it works,” says Emily-Jayne Wooding, lead quality assurance manager, McDonald’s. “We use 100% British or Irish beef in all our patties – with only salt and pepper added after cooking.” The myths haven’t disappeared in the digital age. Despite McDonald’s running a campaign to reassure the public that its patties are 100% beef, about 10 years ago, a wild story began circulating online that McDonald’s bought its beef from a company called “100% British and Irish Beef”. The ridiculous claim suggested that the reference to “100% British and Irish Beef” on adverts and burger boxes referred to this (non-existent) company – a legal loophole to trick customers into believing they were eating pure beef. It’s incredible to think this hard-to-believe tale actually had people fooled! Humphrey Wells is passionate about the welfare of the 300 cattle he rears – and proud of the end product his herd produces for McDonald’s. “Welfare is always our number-one priority,” says Wells. “We have an innate love for our animals.” Wells is a third-generation farmer at his wife Rhiannon’s family farm, which he runs alongside her and her parents, John and Helen. The farm has been supplying beef to food producers, including McDonald’s, for decades. “Since joining the farm I’ve been really impressed with the quality standards McDonald’s looks for from its producers,” says Wells. “There’s a bit of a perception out there that McDonald’s burgers are full of nasties, but that’s not the case,” adds Wells. “They’re simply made from British or Irish beef.” McDonald’s selects two high-quality cuts for its patties, known for their rich taste: the cow’s forequarter (which yields umami-heavy cuts, such as brisket and ribs) and the flank (a flavourful, lean cut from the hindquarters). The forequarter and flank are ground together and chilled to -1C, which binds the meat. “We use a mixture of fresh and frozen beef to form the right patty – no binders, no additives, no dextrose,” says Neil Dodd, commercial manager at OSI Europe, the food firm which has been supplying McDonald’s red meat in the UK since 1978. The inspections at the OSI plant in Scunthorpe begin as soon as the meat arrives from farms to ensure the butchery is free of defects. Along the way, further quality checks take place including cooking six patties on a McDonald’s grill in the processing facility once an hour to ensure the patties “reach the perfect sear”, says Dodd. Sam Madden, the Scunthorpe site’s general manager, is one of the people who does the hourly patty tastings, even if it’s 8am. “I had some this morning for my breakfast!” he laughs. The myths about McDonald’s beef patties containing questionable ingredients contrast sharply with the reality: the only seasoning added is a sprinkle of salt and pepper after cooking in the restaurants. “Each grill station has salt and pepper shakers, which shake just the right amount on to the patties,” says Angel Walsh, business manager at a McDonald’s restaurant in Crewe. “I can tell straight away if a patty hasn’t been seasoned: it’s something we take very seriously,” she laughs. She also quashes another misconception. “We never flip the patties!” she says. “They’re cooked on a double-sided grill, which means we don’t need to turn them over.” Thinner patties take 48 seconds to cook, while thicker patties take 130 seconds. Madden says he’s baffled by the spread of misinformation about McDonald’s food: “Having worked in the food industry for 20 years, I’d say McDonald’s is the best out there. Their transparency and standards are incredibly high.” McDonald’s patties are made from 100% pure beef, using only whole cuts from the forequarter and flank. The meat is simply minced and moulded into patties – nothing else is added except a pinch of salt and pepper after cooking. There are no preservatives, binders or flavour enhancers, and every patty served in the UK comes from British or Irish farms approved by nationally recognised farm assurance schemes. Myths may still swirl online – but for the farmers, factory teams and restaurant crews who know what really goes into each patty, the truth is refreshingly simple: sometimes, what you see really",Christian Koch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/27/lowdown-hawke-devils-backbone-del-toro-week-in-reviews,The Lowdown to The Devil’s Backbone: the week in rave reviews,2025-12-27T06:00:33.000Z,"Ethan Hawke is a triumph in a poignant new comedy-drama, and Guillermo del Toro’s breakout horror flick gets a rerelease. Here’s the pick of the week’s culture, taken from the Guardian’s best-rated reviews Ethan Hawke stars in this very funny but profound drama from Reservation Dogs creator Sterlin Harjo. “A poignant and surprisingly personal story, about purpose and ageing and noble failure; about the timeless truth that the journey is more important than the destination. ” The acting great invites Sir Kenneth Branagh over for a cuppa, and proves a surprisingly good interviewer – and owner of a foul-mouthed parrot. “The section on Dench’s late husband, Michael Williams, in particular, is the highlight here. Her house is full of trinkets of the pair of them, and when Branagh pulls out a tablet to show her a clip of Williams in Henry V, she’s moved to silence by the sight of him. If there’s a lovelier, more touching moment on television this month, I’ll be staggered.” The Peep Show cast (minus Robert Webb) reunite for a festive special that is oddly soothing to watch. “It is lovely to see the old gang again: this time in the spotlessly clean environs of the Bake Off tent instead of a shabby Croydon flat painted various shades of B&Q’s Miasmic Despair range, for The Great Peep Show Christmas Bake Off.” It’s a mini Ab Fab reunion for this festive special, as the cast – including Joanna Lumley – decamp for a Christmas at the home of Aunt Joan (AKA Jennifer Saunders). “It has been around for less than a year, yet the wildly popular Motherland spin-off feels as if it has been with us for ever, so timeless are the characters.” A bitterly funny, achingly realistic thriller about an anaesthetist who flies to New Zealand for the wedding of her younger sister, only to find her dead. “The inherent strangeness and wild beauty of the New Zealand setting add a dash of menace to every scene, a sense that anything might be possible if you take your eye off someone or something for a moment too long.” Timothée Chalamet stars as an on-the-make hustler trying to rise up the table tennis rankings in the early 1950s in an anxiety-inducing tale directed by Josh Safdie. “It’s a marathon sprint of gonzo calamities and uproar, a sociopath-screwball nightmare like something by Mel Brooks – only in place of gags, there are detonations of bad taste, cinephile allusions, alpha cameos, frantic deal-making, racism and antisemitism, sentimental yearning and erotic adventures.” Joachim Trier’s entertaining drama sees Norwegian auteur-on-the-slide Stellan Skarsgård putting his showbiz family through the wringer in the service of his fading career. “An uproarious but bittersweet black comedy of the movie world and showbusiness and the emotional vampirism and ruthlessness it involves, with a touch of All About Eve perhaps – made worse when you are working with members of your own family.” Documentary covering the late musical hero’s last couple of decades, in which he bounced from mediocrity to national treasure to creative resurgence. “It would be wrong to call it going out on a high, under the circumstances, but it’s heartening that Bowie could craft such a poignant, defiant, dignified exit.” Rerelease of 2001 gothic gem from Guillermo del Toro, a part-horror, part-fairytale set in a haunted orphanage, executed with trademark technical flair and a good deal of empathy. “The political and the supernatural come together beautifully (and violently), and the unsentimental portrayal of childhood is refreshing, with terrific performances from the boy actors.” Meditation on plants and their people in which houseplants appear to make conversation and yearn for lost friends in a witty yet luminous film. “This experimental documentary by Jesse McLean about houseplants inspired me to go around my house and water all my vegetal housemates and treat the mealybug infections afflicting the jade plants in my office. Now I feel better for it in every way, while also basking in the afterglow of this luminous piece of film-making that is cinematic fertiliser for thought.” A globe-spanning history of capitalism’s first thousand years. “Beckert enjoys shredding capitalism’s self-flattering myths. He calls the notion of the free market ‘nothing more than a figment of scholars’ and ideologues’ imaginations’.” An estranged mother and son come to terms with each other in Tokyo. “All the staples of Washington’s style are on show: the mumblecore prose, the interest in Asian culture, messy gay bars, a chosen family of queer sidekicks, frank presentations of sex and sexuality.” A deep dive into the world of the undead. “The author, a historian and archeologist, argues that belief in the unquiet dead is found in many cultures and periods, where it can lay dormant for centuries before erupting.” The American novelist uses fiction to explore her Chinese mother’s life and their difficult relationship. “Just as her mother was berated as a girl for her curiosity and spirit, so she berated Jen with the same cutting refrains: ‘Bad bad girl!’ and ‘No one will ever marry you’.” A brilliant debut short story collection confronting Northern Ireland’s bloody past. “Ní Chuinn’s stories are unpredictable and memorable … they describe entanglements that cannot be ignored or consigned to history.” For the year’s outstanding releases, explore the Guardian’s best of 2025 music coverage, including the best",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is really fun, and then it is a bit too much fun, and by the time I realise I’ve stepped over that line, whoops, it’s too late. I’ve overdone it, and all I want to do is lie down in a dark room. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Christmas is an intense and immersive experience. It is not just the alcohol, not just the food, although there have definitely been way too much of both of those things round my way. It is the whole sensory world. The new perfume your auntie got for Christmas going head-to-head with the cinnamon-scented tea lights. The nostalgia-soaked playlists and soppy romcoms. The kids on laps, the dogs on sofas, the fridge that barely closes. No doubt there was a point back there when I could have said: “You know what, I’ve had an elegant sufficiency of cheer, just a water and a quiet night with my journal tonight thanks,” but I was too busy singing along to Mariah Carey to notice and the moment passed. No matter. Better to err on the side of too much jolliness than too little, after all. Now that the triptych of Christmas Eve, The Day Itself and Boxing Day are done, we can dial things down. But let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. These post-Christmas days are, for many of us, an important moment of rest and relaxation. There is a sleepiness to the world right now. What day of the week is it? Are the trains running/shops open? No other time of year feels quite the same. The Twixmas days have a texture all of their own, a braiding together of hearty walks, long films, bubble and squeak. The dress code is simple. What you need is a jumper that is cosy and special, but not overtly Christmassy. This, my friends, is the festive knit you really need, the one that will do you proud from the first days of December right to the last. The just-for-fun jumper, not a Fun Jumper. To be clear, this means a knit with absolutely no reindeer. A hard no to gingerbread men. Zero tolerance of red-breasted robins. A snowflake motif is acceptable, at a push, if it is abstract and elegant. Holly, berries, that sort of thing are passable, but no Christmas trees please. Don’t even get me started on “Ho Ho Ho” jumpers, which will land you straight on the naughty list. Argyle diamonds, Fair Isle patterns: these are perfect. Think Scandi drama, not Santa’s grotto. These betwixt-and-between Twixmas days can feel lazy in a luxurious way, or they can feel aimless in a discombobulating way. The right outfit can help you land on the right side of that line. The texture of a nice knit is unbeatable for when you want to feel wholesome but sophisticated, as if you are the sort of person who takes contemplative walks on beaches and knows how to cook things with clams. Be wary of the seductive tactile appeal of the super-chunky jumper, though. The most useful all-through-December knit, which is what we are aiming for, is one that keeps your body temperature optimal whether you are indoors doing nothing, or striding out on a brisk walk. A very heavy jumper is liable to leave you red-faced in both of those scenarios. The right one is the knitwear equivalent of good lighting. It softens the edges, smooths over the late nights and the extra helpings. It is perfect for meeting friends to go for a walk, which is the kind of thing you might have in the diary for the next few days, because it will be comfy and warm but will also look nice in photos if someone gets their phone out. You want a knit that feels joyful, not hectic.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/harry-redknapp-im-in-champions-league-after-jukebox-man-king-george-hit-horse-racing,Harry Redknapp says he’s ‘in Champions League’ after Jukebox’s King George hit,2025-12-26T17:45:11.000Z,"Former football manager’s horse wins Kempton thriller Cheltenham Gold Cup up next for the gutsy winner “Today, we’ve gone into the Champions League,” Harry Redknapp, the owner of The Jukebox Man, said after his horse had fought back to win an extraordinary three-way photo-finish in the here on Friday. “We got into the Premier League, which was fantastic, but today we were taking on the Real Madrids and Barcelonas and he proved he can compete with them and win against them, which was an amazing feeling.” It was, in truth, simply an amazing race from start to finish, with one of the most enthralling passages of action from the home turn to the line that anyone here could recall in a Grade One steeplechase. , its owners, which has signed over an option to developers that would see it bulldozed for housing, but its speed-favouring, right-handed track is something special and unique in British jumping and here it produced an all-time classic for a sell-out crowd of 17,000 spectators. Eight horses set off for what was, on paper at least, the best renewal of this famous race for at least a decade, and after Il Est Francais had ensured a decent gallop through the first two-and-a-half miles, with scarcely the hint of a mistake from any of his rivals, all eight were still within three lengths of each other at the final turn. The Jukebox Man then jumped the third-last fractionally ahead of Jango Baie and Gaelic Warrior – the 9-4 joint-favourites – with Djelo another half-length behind. By the second-last, Banbridge, last year’s winner, had joined issue with the leaders as Djelo started to fade, and the four horses were all in the air together at the last. The Jukebox Man, though, had met it slightly wrong and conceded what appeared to be a crucial quarter-length before finding an immense final effort that saw him squeeze between Gaelic Warrior and Banbridge and get a flared nostril down right on the line. The margins were the minimum of a nose and the same, with just a half-length back to Jango Baie in fourth, and while the TV cameras zeroed in on The Jukebox Man and Ben Jones as the winners, Redknapp was less convinced that he had just achieved the biggest win of his long career as an owner. He stepped away from the crowd of well-wishers near the winner’s enclosure, alone with his thoughts as he awaited the judge’s verdict, but when the announcement came – “First, number eight” – there was a huge roar of approval from every corner of the track. “It is a dream to have a horse that good,” Redknapp said. “Just to run was a great thing for me as I was so proud of having a runner here, but to have the winner is special. “What a race he has run. He has jumped unbelievable. I thought he was beat when they came to him and I thought he will finish fourth, but he has come again. The guts the horse has shown is just amazing.” 12.05 Roi Du Risk 12.37 Kapamazov 1.12 Casa Loupi 1.47 Two To Tango 2.22 Jhentong Enki 2.57 Heeztheboy (nap) 3.32 Gentleman Toboot 12.18 Bravethewaves 12.53 Ballyeaston 1.28 Classical Sting 2.03 Ninna Collina 2.38 Redbridge Rambler 3.13 Camarrate 1.00 Cerelia 1.35 Ziggy’s Angel 2.10 Raging Raj 2.45 Bowfell 3.20 Hunky Dory 3.50 Sax Appeal 4.20 Toolatetonegotiate (nb) 4.50 Mr Nugget Redknapp has owned horses both on the Flat and over jumps since the 1980s, and knows well that it is a game where occasional triumphs will – hopefully – cancel out the many disappointments. He even warned Ben Pauling, The Jukebox Man’s trainer, that he was “an unlucky owner” before first sending him a horse about eight years ago, but they have enjoyed a near-constant run of success ever since including a first win for Redknapp’s colours “It is right up there with my best achievements,” Redknapp said. “Football is my life, so when you are winning the FA Cup final for the fans [as he did ] it is an incredible feeling. We had a lot of support here today and I love the racing and the people in it, so to have a winner on the big stage is fantastic. “Ben trained Shakem Up’Arry to win at Cheltenham, which was a dream, and then to come here today is great so Ben has done amazingly well for me. We’ve not had a bad horse, touch wood.” The Jukebox Man went into Friday’s race as the least exposed runner in the field, making just his fourth start in a chase. Having proved himself worthy of a place against the Madrids and Barcas of the racing world, attention now turns to the sport’s showpiece meeting in March – a rough equivalent of the Euros as the elite jumping horses from Britain, Ireland and France converge on Cheltenham. Pauling did not hesitate to point The Jukebox Man towards the Cheltenham Gold Cup, over an additional quarter-mile, and his chaser will not race again before the festival. “What a very special day,” Pauling said. “It really is the moment where you score the winning goal with a minute to go, that was as tight as it gets. “I think you would be daft not to go to the Gold Cup now if he comes out of it well, and what a race that will be as well.” Jonjo and AJ O’Neill were forced to shut down operations at their Jackdaw’s Castle stable in early November as a virus swept through the yard but their string was showing a signs of a revival before Christmas, with four wins from 15 runners, and their eight-year-old has an obvious each-way chance in the Coral Welsh Grand National at Chepstow on Saturday. Collectors Item was one of his yard’s first runners after a three-week closure when he lined up for the Grand National Trial at Chepstow in early December, a race that has been won by the subsequent big-race winner on 27 December in three of the last four seasons. He could not a find way past his fellow front-runner, Jubilee Express, another leading contender for Saturday’s feature race, but was running for the first time since April and has every right to come on for the outing.

https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/dec/27/ticket-fees-uk-gig-goers-fight-back-against-new-wave-of-charges,Ticket fees: UK gig-goers fight back against new wave of charges,2025-12-27T08:00:32.000Z,"Fed-up fans are questioning additional ‘restoration’ costs for new stadiums as well as a lack of transparency Gig-goers who bought tickets for Gorillaz at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in June next year have been refunded some of their booking fee by the ticket seller Gigantic after the Guardian queried the pricing. A reader contacted us asking why he had been charged a £1 “restoration fee” for a concert at the £850m stadium in north London. The Gigantic website also listed the same fee for the recently built Co-op Live arena in Manchester. Restoration fees and levies have become a familiar feature on venue and ticketing websites in recent years – but the reader asked how they could be applied to these two almost brand-new venues, which opened in 2019 and 2024, respectively. When we contacted Gigantic, the company said we needed to speak to the promoter, and it changed its website to explain that this fee was to support grassroots venues. Closer inspection of the other fees that had been charged revealed that while the website listed a 10% booking fee, the reader had been charged 13% – with the 3% adding on almost £3 extra for each ticket purchased. A spokesperson from Kilimanjaro Live, the promoter of the Gorillaz tour, confirmed that the ticketing website had made an error and that all affected buyers would be given a refund of the difference. The story highlights how the plethora of fees being added to tickets mean that fans can quickly lose track of how much they should pay. Last year, research by the consumer body Which? found that extra charges including delivery and transaction fees, booking fees, service fees and order processing fees, can found that only 35% of respondents were aware of all charges before reaching the checkout stage, while only 34% of respondents said they were aware of what each charge was for. Alice Andrews recently bought tickets to see the pop-rapper Pitbull at London’s BST Hyde Park in July 2026. The price of the three tickets without fees was £329.85. There was an added £3 transaction fee, a £3 sustainability levy, and a £37.50 service fee – making a total of £373.35. Like many music fans, she says she wants greater transparency over how much tickets will cost in total, and where this extra money goes. “I would like to know what my money is going to be used for if I’m going to pay a fee,” she says. “It has put me off big gigs before.” Andrew Simpson, a regular gig-goer, says that when looking at tickets for Haim at Manchester’s Co-op Live, on top of the £51.75 face value for a general admission ticket to stand, there was an £8 service fee, £2.35 handling fee, and £2.95 facility fee – bringing the total up to £65.05. When he looked for a breakdown of what the fees covered, the website said the facility fee “keeps the venue running, helping us to improve our services and experiences for all fans …” “This is just a meaningless sentence and tells me nothing,” Simpson says. Some independent venues, such as the Clapham Grand in London and Saint Luke’s in Glasgow, have listened to feedback from ticket buyers and now include a breakdown of expenses online that show what additional fees, such as a restoration levy, are for. Some specify what an added charge is for at the time of purchase – for example, it may be used to finance a new floor. When the Guardian approached Gigantic, it said the restoration fee was in fact a £1 Live Trust donation, where the money is given to smaller, independent venues via a scheme by the Music Venue Trust, a charity which acts to “protect, secure and improve UK grassroots music venues for the benefit of venues, communities and upcoming artists”. The reader who got in touch has received their overpayment back from Gigantic. Mark Davyd, the chief executive officer of the Music Venue Trust, says the reason there are so many fees is because of the number of players that are involved in selling tickets. Often fees are set by different parties involved in the process, all of whom argue that they need the money in order to deliver the service or product. He says transparency is actually “irrelevant” to fans, and that they actually just want the total cost to be what is displayed to them on the landing page. “That’s what fans want,” he says. “Delivering that requires government and trading standards bodies to recognise that, and a total rewiring of the terms of the contract.” the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched what it described as a “major consumer protection drive” focused on online pricing practices across a range of sectors including entertainment. These practices include , which is where online shoppers are shown an initial price for an item or service, but then more fees are revealed (or “dripped”) as people progress through the buying process. that found that drip pricing was particularly common when it came to event tickets (it indicated they were present at 93% of the businesses looked at). The competition watchdog said it had begun investigations into eight companies about their pricing practices, two of which were sellers of event tickets: StubHub and Viagogo. It said these two companies were under review over the mandatory additional charges applied when consumers buy tickets, and whether or not these fees were included upfront. However, it said that at this stage it had reached no conclusions about whether the law had been broken in any of these investigations.",Aneesa Ahmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s time to get rid hen I was a kid, our TV was in a television cabinet. For those unfamiliar with this preposterous abomination, it was a box on legs into which the TV was placed to hide it. It was some sort of furniture hangover from the era of covering a piano’s ankles lest they cause lustful sweats to break out under the starched collars of young gentlemen. The trouble is, a two-doored, TV-shaped-and-sized box in the corner of the room where the TV would usually be, cables trailing from its rear and armchairs angled towards it, was about as good a disguise as when a child lacking object permanence puts its hand up to its eyes and assumes the rest of the world can’t see it. The other thing is: the TV didn’t need a box. It already had a box built round it. It even had a nickname, in case that wasn’t evident enough: “the box”. A box does not need a box. And so, in the same vein, a sink does not need a second sink sitting in it. The washing-up bowl is indefensible. Think on this as you wash your Christmas dishes. A bowl within a bowl. A water receptacle within a water receptacle. It does everything the sink does, and less. It doesn’t drain, for one thing. It has to be emptied into the sink for that to happen. (Although there are now some with plugholes, as if the pointlessness of this recursive arrangement needed underlining For something that deals with water and the making cleaner of things, the washing-up bowl has some unsavoury side effects: that sump of waterlogged food clinging to its bottom, for instance. Or the fact that, over time, it becomes furry, sprouting little mussel-like beards of plastic. That’s the other thing. This unnecessary, unhygienic, wan-coloured prophylactic, like so much other tat designed to keep us at one remove from the reality of our homes (toilet-seat lid covers, plug-in air fresheners) is landfill-in-waiting. “But it saves water!” cry its approbators. What arrant balls. If the logic here is that it holds less water than a sink, then first, it isn’t much of a saving and, second, less water can be used in the sink. Using less water saves water. Using a receptacle within a receptacle doesn’t. If you put a large plastic bath-shaped tub in your bath before bathing, people would rightly think you’d lost your mind. Let your sink be proudly naked. Ban the bowl.

Don’t panic – here’s your festive survival guide,2025-12-22T19:00:35.000Z,"Skip the Christmas scramble with our last-minute decor and gifting hacks; Jo Malone spills her shopping secrets; and the best tequila for festive tipples with a twist en years ago and newly married, I was invited to spend with my husband’s extended family. “We’re not doing gifts this year, there are too many of us,” my husband told me in early December when I queried who to buy for. So, I showed up with a roll of novelty Christmas pudding bin bags and wine for the hosts. Imagine my embarrassment later that day when his aunt, uncle and cousins all handed me gifts so beautiful and thoughtful I still use them today. I resolved then to never enter the festive period without an arsenal of last-minute gift ideas in my back pocket – and also not to take everything my husband says as read. The Christmas delivery window might be closing faster than that big stone door in Indiana Jones, but our should help you avoid similar embarrassment over that aunt/godchild/husband you’ve forgotten to buy for. We have ideas from tickets for next year’s cultural highlights to monthly food subscriptions (olive oil, coffee, brownies) that will be the gift that keeps on giving well into 2026. If you do still want a physical gift, we’ve also included retailers who will take orders right down to the wire. You also can’t go wrong with a stash of spare homemade presents. My sister-in-law makes little tins of her delicious brownies; I make my family “chocolate crunch” recipe (a spin on tiffin) wrapped in brown paper and tied with a velvet ribbon. An artist friend paints tapered candles: surprisingly simple to do with cream supermarket candles and non-toxic acrylic paint; stick to dots or stripes if you’re a beginner. If you’re not the sort of person who gets their decorations up by 1 December, you may also want to give your home a last-minute Christmas zhoosh. According to interiors brand Ruggable, Google searches for “nostalgic Christmas decorations” are up 200% this year; I grew up in a household decorated with my grandfather’s 1960s crepe paper streamers each Christmas, so I’m all for a classic homemade paper chain. It’s a good use for awkward leftover strips of wrapping paper, too. Paper snowflakes are another lovely thing to do with kids for a bit of instant Christmas kitsch: fold a circle of white paper three times to make a triangle, cut out a pattern of your choice from the edges and unfold. A few years ago, when I didn’t have room for a tree, I filled a tall vase with bare winter branches and hung glass bird decorations on them ( ) – you can also add twinkly or ribbons. Nini Torres, co-founder of Bimba Floral Studio, suggests baking thin slices of orange in the oven until they’re dry, then stringing them together to make a fragrant garland for your mantelpiece or table: “Each slice will dry differently from the others, which makes it feel really organic.” She also suggests making a tree-shaped centrepiece from clementines ( ), using sticks to secure them to a foam base and filling the gaps with rosemary. Otherwise, she says an arrangement of pine stems in a vase can be mixed “with berries or cascades of ivy” for an instant Christmassy look. (Read our guide to And what about last-minute guests? Chef Ben Slater says a good corner shop blini alternative is toasted wedges of crumpet: “Load them up with something creamy, something smoked and something herby to make the ultimate last-minute canape.” On The Table co-founder Lucy Mee suggests cocktail sausages with a dip of chilli jam or squares of puff pastry baked with honey, charcuterie and cheese .

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/dec/25/readers-favourite-theatre-of-2025,‘The best thing I have ever witnessed on stage’: readers’ favourite theatre of 2025,2025-12-25T06:00:32.000Z,"A transcendent new take on King Lear, a thrilling Evita and a show at Glasgow’s revamped Citizens that reduced one viewer to a ‘blubbering wreck’ are among your highlights A masterclass in theatrical innovation – technically groundbreaking, seamlessly blending live performance with complex pre-recorded media to blur the line between reality and fiction. The production expertly toyed with audience expectations, weaponising the very genre tropes that fans have come to anticipate. Ultimately, the show’s genius lay in its finale. Rather than a grim twist, the doors of No 9 closed with a defiant, glitzy Hollywood musical high-kicking routine. A joyous, unexpected celebration of showbiz cementing the production’s status as a triumph of meta-theatre. I went into Łukasz Twarkowski’s Rohtko unsure about the four-hour commitment, but it ultimately left me astonished. The production’s constantly shifting, ingeniously constructed sets and inventive live-filming techniques were unlike anything I’ve seen on stage. The narrative – by turns surreal, chaotic and strangely moving – pulled me in completely, and the score elevated every moment. It was an audacious, immersive experience that held my attention from start to finish. Ashley Pharoah’s play is a perfect encapsulation of the importance of regional theatre: a superbly written and brilliantly acted production that, while holding a layer of appeal for those familiar with Exeter Chiefs rugby club, was still compelling for those from further afield. Enough exposition for the unfamiliar without derailing the plot or distracting from the characters. Triumphant. I’m a playwright and novelist living in the beleaguered US, who attends London theatre annually. Fat Ham was exhilarating and delightful. Having seen Andrew Scott as Hamlet, I feel I’ve seen the best of that play as well as the best rethinking of it. The last scene was shocking in a good way, brilliantly performed and exciting. It was the most thrilling show about authoritarianism I’ve ever seen, drawing the audience into the allure of power. Rachel Zegler was a force of nature, seducing the audience outside from the balcony, even as she mocked them inside. Diego Andres Rodriguez as Che paired with her in a classic love-hate relationship, like a sadomasochistic Fred and Ginger, which was simultaneously fierce and funny, even as Zegler’s Evita used Juan Perón as a tool to realise her ambitions. The front row had a perfect view, too, and was offered as a £20-£25 bargain to early bookers. I’ll never forget this production. A transcendent experience at the Edinburgh festival. Without a doubt, Venetia Bowe’s lead performance was the best thing I have ever witnessed on stage. When the play came to its ethereal end and the lights finally went down, it looked as if the audience might fly through the ceiling, they were so quick to get to their feet. The Welsh National Opera performed Leonard Bernstein’s Candide earlier this year. The performances and staging, which included some brilliant animation scenes, were fantastic. It was extra special to share the experience with my mum, who has been going to see the WNO since the early 80s. A great experience: the actors were incredibly good and the play was so intriguing that it had me on the edge of my seat. The dialogues were witty and suspenseful and some surprises in the plot got me thinking. But above all, I found the characters and their interaction really moving. The ending, where Billy came back to what she had said at the beginning, was touching too. I don’t usually make the trip to the RSC, but as a massive fan of Radiohead I felt I had to see this version. I thought it was fantastic, perfectly integrating the angsty music with the themes of the play, often leaving me speechless. To take such a well-known story and make it feel so exciting and overwhelming (in a good way!) was a very pleasant surprise. A stunning script perfectly acted by Jack Lowden and Martin Freeman. There was a tremendous chemistry between the two actors. I also thought the use of the stage was brilliant. It seems that every seat has a great vantage point so for me the theatre is 10/10 too. This was a thrilling fictionalisation of the relationship between Shakespeare and Marlowe, and although at its heart it was a gritty drama about spying and political intrigue in Elizabethan England, there was also a lot of humour and literary wordplay and a surprising amount of raunchiness. Framing Shakespeare as the shy, sensitive flower to Marlowe’s man-about-town worked strikingly well. Small Acts of Love at the stunningly restored and reopened Citizens theatre in Glasgow reduced this 63-year-old bloke to a blubbering wreck. It was my first visit to the “Citz” and my first experience of a National of Scotland production. It’s a play that deserved to go much further and to be shown online.",Guardian readers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. f it’s true that you can judge a person by their shoes, then it’s perhaps even more so when it comes to their slippers. What you choose to put on your feet in your own home is a window into what you value most. As such, buying the perfect pair for yourself is an act of self-nurture. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. If that all feels too hyperbolic, it feels safe to say that they’re at least a reflection of your favourite mode of relaxation and how high you like to turn up the heating. I’ve been hooked on slippers ever since my best friend bought me a hot-pink pair with monsters on when I was 10. Today, I write about style for a living, and have a healthy obsession with not letting my feet get cold – I have swallowed whole the idea that cold feet mean you can’t sleep. I also strongly believe that the right slipper can truly make time at home feel 110% more cosy, productive, sociable or fun; whatever you need it to be on any given day. I’ve narrowed down the perfect pairs. Whether you’re after the best slippers for winter, a pair that will stand up to a hotel breakfast, or a practical design for the occasional trip to the bins, read on. I’m a big fan of a mule slipper you can wear at the same time as your chunkiest sock, especially in the depths of winter. If you are too, then these mules may be just what you’re after. Cosy and ready for an alpine chalet in the brown, they’re much less appealing in the cold grey. Wear with a red, green or even – bonus points! – tartan sock for the These cosy wool slip-ons from Danish brand Egos are on my feet right now. They may not be the prettiest slippers, but they’re among the best I’ve ever had the pleasure to own. I bought them two years ago and have worn them daily every winter since, yet they still seem as if they have years left in them. I like a slipper you can slip on and off with ease – with a bit of a sole, but still feeling soft and supple. They also need to be neutral enough to suit even the most colour-clashing outfit you wear behind closed doors. These ones, designed in Copenhagen and handmade in Nepal, offer all of that. Plus, presumably designed with Danish winter in mind, they would keep feet warm well into the Arctic Circle. If the somewhat sombre grey doesn’t do it for you, they also come in “Ethically minded small business” the Small Home makes these slippers out of British sheepskin. They come in a trio of understated colours, each with a different pattern embroidered on the upper. All feature a fluffy inside layer that will make feet feel loved. They’re handmade on a small scale, and the company says it sources its sheepskin from a supplier with the highest animal welfare standards, using either byproducts from the meat industry or off-cuts from Rolls-Royce car interiors. They look like something Sienna Miller may have slipped into at home in Primrose Hill during the 00s. This pair of cow-print slippers from Marks & Spencer is perfect if you like to have warm feet without totally abandoning looking With a chunky grip that would – aptly but perhaps not very usefully – stand you in good stead in a muddy field, they’ll be as great for at-home parties as for days spent chewing the fat with your family. If the cow print is sold out in your size, you could try the more classic The slippers you receive guests in are a good indicator of the kind of host you are. When my ever-immaculate colleague Jess Cartner-Morley as the “world’s most elegant slipper”, she gave a strong hint that dinner at her house is an elegant affair. A shoe designed for ballet will also prove an excellent choice if dinner escalates into dancing in the kitchen. But for all of the highbrow associations, these ballet shoes cost a very reasonable £22. If you’re more likely to have friends round for pizza on the sofa – or wine on the floor – then perhaps these will be more your speed. Handmade in a workshop in Greece, these slippers lasted me for years, despite the pom-pom proving a tempting target for my cat. The inside might be wool, but be warned, I found them surprisingly chilly without a sock. They come in various stitched designs and colours and have a practical leather sole. If you’re looking for glamour in a slipper, then look away now. These mules, available in workhorse dark green and navy, come in hard-wearing nylon they’re a donkey of a slipper. Treat them well, and they’ll work hard around the home while also carrying you steadfastly down to the bins. The good grips should stop you slipping on a frosty morning, while the fluffy lining will keep toes toasty. These slippers from the outdoorsy US brand Keen are another pair unafraid of a bit of hard work. Again, nobody said they were elegant, but they would stand up well to excursions outside. Their bungees tighten for a cosier fit and the soles give some traction on a frosty garden path. The black nylon model will wipe down particularly well, should any bin juice come their way. This is not a serious slipper; this is a non-slipper for the person who, for whatever reason, doesn’t like slippers. Technically bed socks, these carefree beauties are made in Japan by sleep specialist Iwata out of all-natural materials. For all their frivolity, they do make a concession to practicality and can be gently hand-washed. Perhaps best of all, looking down at these is bound to elicit a smile. Rarely will your feet have been so cosy, or looked so joyously daft. Currently only available in medium, large and extra-large, so it looks like, for the moment at least, the larger-footed among us are going to be the ones with the most supremely cosy feet. Reversible with collapsable heels, these look like a slipper worn by someone who knows their way around Adobe Illustrator. Hailing from Japan, they pack down tightly and are lightweight. They may be a slouch of a slipper, but they’re also chic in the kind of IYKYK (“if-you-know-you-know”) way. Knitted and hand-finished, they’re available in various patchworks of seasonal fabrics. While these are a bit more substantial, they’re the work of minimalist shoe company Vivobarefoot. The brand specialises in barely there shoes, and this pair can curl up tight like a cinnamon bun for fitting into a crammed suitcase. They won’t show you up if you’re a houseguest for the weekend, and they’re muted enough to go with anything you’ve packed. They’re made in partnership with Mongolian craftswomen using 100% wool felt, have an easy-to-clean leather sole. But if this is the slipper of choice for you, you’re very much not alone– they’re only available in a few remaining sizes. The pandemic convinced me and many others that wearing shoes to work from home increases productivity. Enter this more-professional-than-your-average slipper, weighted with corporate greatness – the brand is popular with the Silicon Valley crowd, and the price is certainly more in line with corporate budgets. Wool, washable and with a neoprene heel to lock in your foot, they certainly help me feel more switched on, even while I’m on the sofa. Sleek in design, these well-built slippers should last long after Q4 is over. They’re available in a pleasingly wide range of professional tones, as well as very fun hot pinks and highlighter yellows. Perhaps most intriguing of all is the chance to print your own message across the design. Whether you go for a motivational mantra or something a bit more NSFW is up to you. Some prefer to go barefoot in the summer months, but for those like me who still like some sole, a pair of Havaianas is perfect. While most other flip-flops I’ve tried have earned their “toe killer” nickname, Havaianas caress the toe joint with a little more tenderness. And they come in a rainbow of fun colours. The company says that 40% of the sole is made from rubber scraps recycled from the production process, but I still like to find them secondhand – well, almost. If you don’t like the thought of someone else’s feet, look on Vinted or similar for new ones, either with or without tags. Plenty of people seem to buy the wrong pair and off-load them untouched. Another ideal house shoe for warmer months or climes, these sleek Birkenstocks are easy to slip on and off. They’ll work for popping outside for a spot of watering – helpfully, they’re waterproof – and they’re comfy enough to wear around the house. They come in regular and narrow fit.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/26/apple-seeks-to-appeal-15bn-ruling-it-overcharged-uk-customers,Apple seeks to appeal against £1.5bn ruling it overcharged UK customers,2025-12-26T17:00:14.000Z,"If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation Apple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store. maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”. It is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating. The appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law. “It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said. Kent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout. In the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service. Instead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case. Another of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation. “Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected. His suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law. Coll said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.” A Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.” Google argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe. And in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it. Apple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024. Kent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”. “There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time. “A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",Robert Booth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A white dome floats in the gloaming above a plain black doorway outlined with red light, like a portal to another dimension.

There are sessions on astrophotography and, on moonless nights, dark sky astronomy with the chance to see “a glittering tapestry of stars, galaxies, nebulae and star clusters”. Its director, Gary Fildes, is a veteran in the field, having founded and led three UK observatories over two decades. The goal at Grizedale, he says, is to create “an immersive, year-round astronomy and science destination that brings the beauty of the Lake District skies to visitors”. The observatory’s regular evenings form part of in late October and November. The festival offers owl- and bat-spotting walks and chances to swim or . But the observatory does more than dip a toe in the cosmic lake – it’s a permanent centre for studying the stars. A group of 60 schoolkids is arriving in the morning. I’m here for an Aurora Night, timed to coincide with a period of high solar activity, but the heavens are stubbornly blanketed with cloud. The first drops of rain are falling as we head into Mission Control, with its little cafe tables,hand-painted otherworldly mural, inflatable alien and row of model rockets, built to scale by the observatory’s manager, Ben Marshall, a spaceflight obsessive. A couple of hours later, we’re all staring up in wonder at a bejewelled night sky with shooting stars – thanks to the centre’s planetarium. An illustrated talk about auroras in the Stargazers’ Lounge combines detailed explanations with a sense of cosmic wonder. In the Meteorite Lab next door, there are microscopes and little space rocks – including actual pieces of the moon and Mars. After hot drinks in Mission Control, Gary leads us through torrential rain to the new cedar-smelling observatory he helped build. He shows us extraordinary photos of the spiralling Andromeda galaxy and the dark Horsehead nebula, silhouetted against a glowing red dust and gas cloud, all taken by the robotic telescope in the retractable custom-built dome. For nights when the weather won’t cooperate, Grizedale gives out a free clear-sky pass so visitors can come back and stargaze another time. The observatory’s team are clearly enthusiasts. Gary has been fascinated by the night sky “ever since I was a kid growing up in Sunderland, standing in the back garden and looking up, wondering what all those stars were”. His life story is remarkable. He tells me: “I was a bricklayer for years, but that curiosity about the universe never really went away. Eventually, I decided to take a massive leap and follow that passion properly – and it changed my life. I built in Teesdale, and now I’m working in Saudi Arabia developing the Al-Ula Manara Space Observatory, one of the most exciting astronomy projects in the world.” Gary describes how one observatory visitor wept when she first saw Saturn through a telescope, explaining that her father used to draw planets in a wartime air raid shelter and ringed Saturn was her favourite. “For me, astronomy isn’t just about science and telescopes,” says Gary. “It’s about people. It’s about perspective, wonder, and realising that we’re all part of something far bigger.” No buses run to Grizedale Forest, but getting here without a car has been surprisingly easy. After an early start from Essex into London, the train up to Oxenholme takes less than three hours, racing past the Chilterns woods and Midlands canals to the cloud-capped Cumbrian fells. The branch line to Windermere is a 20-minute ride through tussocky fields of Herdwick sheep and slate-roofed, whitewashed villages. Finally, bus 505 from outside Windermere station loops round the lake and winds through hilly beech woods to reach the village of Hawkshead by lunchtime. There are various ways of getting from Hawkshead to the observatory, about 3 miles south: or on foot. I decide to and back via Hawkshead Moor. There are streams to hop and boggy hills to climb, but the views are worth it. Home to the UK’s first , Grizedale has a huge collection of site-specific art. With a , I follow one waterlogged path to see Andy Goldsworthy’s sinuous dry-stone wall, . Created in 1990, it’s dressed in thick moss and hidden among dense fir trees. There’s no sound other than rushing water and the calls of tiny, pine-loving goldcrests. next door to the observatory, and I’m sleeping there tonight. It’s a real log cabin, immaculately clean, with walls of thick pine trunks, tartan wool curtains and furry blankets. Umbrellas stand by the cabin door, on hand for the changeable Cumbrian weather. On a nocturnal trip to the loo, up a leaf-covered slope, I see a handful of stars finally winking through a gap in the clouds. Heading back towards Hawkshead the next day, I find one of Grizedale’s newer works of art. On a grassy promontory between two waterfalls, (2021) involves what looks like stained glass on steel filigree, creating iridescent dragonfly wings.

Redwings startle from berry-laden bushes and a cormorant skims over the water. Two swans fly overhead, their whirring wings loud in the quiet valley. I’m staying tonight in the cosy, 17th-century , which reopened in August after an exquisitely tasteful refurb. My room, with its gnarled oak beams and cushioned bay window overlooking the village square, is all dusky rose and moss green, with elegant watercolours and floral fabrics. Downstairs, there’s a log-burner and local real ales in the slate-floored bar, and elegant plates in the dining room (the jalapeño jam alongside my onion bhaji is garnished with a purple pansy). With its choice of pubs and cafes, picnic-ready delis, a well-stocked outdoor shop and a cake-filled honesty stall, fell-ringed Hawkshead is a walkers’ paradise.

The law protecting wildlife is outdated and, as recommended by the , is ripe for review. Why, for example, have comprehensive protection for four of our native mustelids and almost nothing for the remaining two? Further, the recent requires the government to consider sentience when framing policy. Against this background, one would have thought a review of outdated wildlife legislation would be a priority. Instead, the edges are tinkered with yet again. The government’s strategy includes a proposal for a close season for hares. It is claimed that fewer young hares will be left vulnerable to starvation and predation. All well and good, unless you happen to be a stoat, a weasel, a carrion crow or a mole – native species which enjoy almost no protection, meaning that thousands of their offspring will continue to die when their parents are killed during the breeding season. The animal welfare strategy sets out a promising plan for raising the welfare of millions of animals that suffer unnecessarily ( ). However, to achieve its ambitious vision of ensuring that as many animals as possible have a good life, the strategy must go further to tackle factory farming. Every year, millions of animals are confined on UK factory farms in abysmal conditions. The strategy has taken crucial steps towards protecting farmed animals from the most cruel aspects of factory farming. Hens will no longer be caged for their eggs and mother pigs will no longer be confined in small crates where they are unable to turn around. However, there are few indications that the strategy will seek to halt the expansion of the factory-farming systems driving such cruelty and threatening our climate, environment and health. The strategy’s announcement comes ahead of the government’s national food strategy and farming vision in 2026. I urge the government to prioritise a shift away from factory farming and support a just transition to nature-friendly farming that benefits animals, farmers and the planet. on electric collars for dogs and cats would result in many more deaths and injuries for cats, if implemented. Electric collars for cats are not for training; they are for containment, and prevent cats straying on to roads and getting run over. We lost many cats to painful, unnecessary deaths on roads, until we installed a containment system. The collars issue a warning bleep if the cat gets close to the perimeter wire, and only give a small electric pulse if the cat moves closer; they soon learn not to get too close. We have not had a cat run over in the 20 years we have had such a system, and have never experienced our cats upset or traumatised by the collars. Another benefit is that containment limits the cats’ exposure to wildlife. Banning these containment systems would be a cruel removal of cats’ safety. It’s welcome news that Labour is bringing in legislation to protect animal welfare ( ). If humans stop being cruel to animals, then possibly humans will also stop being cruel to other humans. You can but dream. I’ve always felt sorry for lobsters, especially as it’s easy to dispatch them instantly.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/26/vip-viewing-cinemas-bet-on-luxury-bars-and-beds-to-usher-in-a-new-film-era,VIP viewing: cinemas bet on luxury bars and beds to usher in a new film era,2025-12-26T07:00:03.000Z,"Sector reinvests in high-end experiences, from front-row beds to premier pods and business class-style seats with built-in wine coolers From champagne coolers to front row VIP beds, cinema owners are investing heavily in premium experiences as the industry gets its box office mojo back. As the third instalment in James Cameron’s blockbuster Avatar series pulls in the Christmas holiday crowds, the UK box office is expected to surpass £1bn in 2025 for the first time since before the global Covid pandemic. Amid financially testing times – with the pace of a hoped-for box office recovery – cinema owners have focused on reinventing the movie-going experience to win back film fans. “We are rolling out 200 of our Ultra Lux seats, which have a built-in champagne or wine cooler, each day across Europe,” says Tim Richards, chief executive and founder of the Vue cinema chain. “Our ‘worst’ seat in the house is a leather recliner, and it is amazingly comfortable. We have been investing very heavily and to use an airline analogy, our new cinemas are business and first class – and that’s it – but at prices for everyone.” Its rival Odeon first launched its premium offering, under the Luxe brand, in 2017 and it now has 38 venues which the company says have become the “defining standard” for customers across its entire estate. Odeon has moved to super-charge its premium strategy with the introduction of Luxe Suite Pods, which it describes as a “private cocoon” with luxury seats that is proving a hit for date night and with families. It is also introducing VIP Beds, now in nine locations, which promise to “transform the front row into the best seat in the house”. “This is next level,” says Suzie Welch, managing director for UK & Ireland at Odeon. “Over the last 18 months we have been looking at what we want to do next with Luxe, what we think our guests want next from their cinema experience. Innovations like the Luxe Suites and VIP Beds are about creating a different experience; families love them and they are great for an evening experience, like a date night. The focus is on how we can give people choice and experiences for all occasions.” The cost of seating in cinemas varies widely depending on factors including the time and day of the week, the type of film, sound and picture technology, and the location. Vue’s Ultra Lux recliner seats range from £10 to about £26. Odeon’s range of Luxe seating runs from £7.50 to £35 for a VIP bed for three, and £28 for a Luxe Pod for two. The path to premium has been pioneered by Everyman, founded in 2000, where viewers can lounge on sofas and have food and beverages ordered to their seats. Its model is proving to be a runaway success post-pandemic, with Everyman’s latest results showing a 46% year-on-year increase in sign-ups to its membership programme in the first half, and revenues growing by a fifth. The chain has also seen admission numbers rise, despite an increase in ticket prices, with movie-goers spending more on food and drink. “Everyman have led the way on premium for more than 20 years – comfy seats, food – other chains are catching on to that,” says Andrew Renton, director of research at Cavendish. “Smaller cinemas, a cosier feel and higher spend.” But the move to premium by mass-market chains – which include operators such as Vue introducing next-generation laser projectors to rival the experience offered by Imax – coincides with a significant shift in cinema-going habits. Cinema attendance has been well down since the pandemic, from 176m annual UK admissions in 2019 to 126m in 2024, as many film fans fell out of love with the big screen. While the push to premium may make film-going a more attractive prospect, cinema audiences are not expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, even if the number of film releases return to pre-2020 levels. The cost of living crisis has meant household bills have soared, making cash-strapped consumers much more selective about what they spend their extra income on. “It is probably the case that movie fans will continue to go less than they did,” says Renton. “However, they are willing to spend more on the occasion, as we have seen in other sectors, such as big ticket gigs like Coldplay and Oasis.” The cinema industry is also continuing to come to grips with the small screen revolution, prompted by the rise of Netflix, with consumers now awash with choice when it comes to in-home entertainment. Netflix’s co-founder, Reed Hastings, once succinctly summed up the intense battle for attention in the digital age when he said the company considered almost every activity to be a rival – Cinema companies are also trying to offer more than the traditional experience as they face extra competition from the rise of the The £98bn market for immersive experiences is booming, from The Greatest Showman-inspired , and Crystal Maze, to more recent pop-ups linked to Minecraft, Jurassic World and Squid Game. “It comes down to what is the purpose of cinema becoming, because it is not just about the old model where it was about going to see a film as soon as it is released,” says Renton. “Now it is much more about experiential leisure. They realise that to continue to capture that going-out experience they have to make a bigger difference. They are doing that through premiumisation.” While there have been flashes of pre-pandemic levels of commercial success, including most recently the Wicked films, the industry still lacks the blockbusters to realise its ambitions for a premium-led-experience recovery. Vue’s CEO, Richards, acknowledges that “2025 is still a period where we have seen 20% fewer movies released compared to the average of the three-year pre-pandemic period of 2017, 2018 and 2019”. However, he points to the increasing commitment to the big screen shown by the Silicon Valley giants as evidence of a healthy future. , has given the iPhone maker confidence in its big-screen strategy. – the Hollywood studio behind the James Bond and Rocky franchises, as well as an extensive library ranging from Gone with the Wind to The Hobbit – the studio is scaling up and matching the output of traditional film studios with plans for 10 big releases in 2026 and a further 16 in 2027. “It takes 18- to 24 months-plus for a major production to go from being green lit to the big screen,” says Richards. “We are just really now starting to see the Hollywood machine rev up and get going again.” For now, the cinema industry is looking at a promising year ahead. Big releases include Super Mario, more editions of Spider-Man, Avengers, Dune and Moana, a fifth Toy Story release and a third in the Jumanji franchise. The insights company Omdia estimates that the volume of releases of films of all budgets in the UK next year will hit 850, the most since 2019. “In totality, next year and in 2027 we will see the same number of releases, or an even greater number, than before the pandemic,” says Richards. “When the history books are written, this is the end of the post-pandemic period and new era of film.”",Mark Sweney,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now we have the stage adaptation, which puts to music the tale of young Nikolas. Aged 11, he is marooned in grief and loneliness after his mother is killed by a bear and his father takes off on an expedition to the North Pole to find the fabled villages of the elves. Nikolas (Devon Sandell, performing on press night and full of energy) follows his father northwards with his pet mouse Miika (Olivia Dickens), to meet a reindeer called Blitzen (Alexander Solly), the Truth Pixie (Daisy Chapman), the elves, and a bevy of other fantastical creatures. This is the second musical in recent times that this theatre has adapted from a hit film that was itself based on a bestselling book. The first was , a charming adaptation that transfers to the West End next month. Lighting does not strike twice with Philip Wilson’s adaptation, which is not nearly as captivating. It is performed by the Chichester Festival Youth , and more than 70 young people do a heroic job. Visually it is delightful, both in its lovely costumes designed by Ryan Dawson Laight and vivid puppets designed by Charlie Tymms. Directed by Dale Rooks and set against Simon Higlett’s mobile stage design of icy wastes and fluttering snowflakes, it is a shame that some grownup professionals do not hold up their part of the bargain. The script by Wilson is staid while the songs (music by Tom Brady with lyrics by Brady and Wilson) are strangely humdrum and samey, from the opening number, How Do You Do It, onwards. The choreography stays minimal and almost static, even at times when the story demands movement, such as during a chase involving a sleigh, and there are certainly no show-stopping song and dance numbers. As a result there is little emotional catch or wonder, when the story should be infused with both elements. Nor is there jeopardy, even when the fearsome bear (George Stanbridge) and troll (Jack Walter-Nelson) make growling appearances. In order to make magic, you have to believe in it, we are told.

She decided university wasn’t for her and remembers how, one by one, she waved off her friends who left the island to study. Many never came back. “I was 18, working in a pub, and I thought, ‘what am I going to do next?’” she says. Megan secured an apprenticeship and now works for an arts organisation on the island, but says her situation is unusual among her friendship group. “I’m definitely an anomaly in that I have a job that I am really passionate about and I really want to be doing,” she says. “Some of my friends here work in very seasonal, part-time employment, centred around hospitality and tourism. They work loads over the summer, but then over the winter they’re on fewer hours and a very low income and are still living at home.” She says there are few affordable housing options and as lots of properties are second homes or Airbnbs, the number of rental properties is limited, “particularly for young people, as most landlords prioritise families or ‘working professionals’”. “There’s also not a lot of opportunity here in terms of social activities for my age group – there are no nightclubs, for example,” she says. “There is an older demographic, with lots of retirees, and it feels like 18- to 35-year-olds are a missing group here.” Between the last two censuses in 2011 and 2021, the number of people aged 65 to 74 on the island . The average age in the area is 51, markedly higher than the average in England of 40. Megan says that the prevailing narrative encouraging young people to “escape” is frustrating. “Adults saying you have to leave the island to succeed and if you don’t leave that you’re ‘settling’ is unhelpful,” she says. “Then they complain there are no young people here.” At the other end of England, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, which borders Scotland, the two phrases often uttered by Colette, 23, and her friends are: “I need to get out” and “we’re so lucky to live in a place like this.” “There is an urge to leave and go to see the rest of the world, to leave a town with an ageing population, an empty high street, closed-minded views, and a place where everyone knows each other,” she says. “But there is also a pull to stay: the increase of independent businesses, the supportive community, the festivals, the increased funding into the arts, and of course the beautiful beaches and hills.” Many of Colette’s friends moved away from Berwick because of a lack of jobs. Others have pursued training or education away from the town. Of those, many won’t be coming back. “Most young people don’t want to leave because they hate the town,” she says. “Everyone I know absolutely loves Berwick. They leave because they don’t have opportunities or their friends have already left.” Colette did return to Berwick after her degree at the University of Bristol. She has been working in a clothes shop and has applied for jobs in the town, but says others were better qualified for the roles. This has prompted her to return to university, this time to study for a master’s degree. “Can I see myself coming back here long term if there were more jobs in the creative fields? Yes. But am I studying with the idea of staying? No, I’m probably studying to leave,” she says. Jacob, 28, who is from Gorleston-on-Sea in Great Yarmouth on the east coast of , felt “disconnected” from his home town growing up. “My memory of looking back isn’t sunny days on the beach – it’s cold, harsh and foggy walks,” he says. “I’m a gay man, but I came out very young, when I was around 12 or 13, and I’m from a conservative town. There is a kind of culture of conservatism in the area, and so being openly gay very early meant I felt a big disconnect from my local place. “I spent a long time when I was younger with an angry mind space because leaving felt more like ‘getting out’. It felt like, ‘this place offers nothing for me.’” After his BA degree, he moved back home and briefly worked at a college. “When you ask young people what they want to do when they grow up, they don’t know because they don’t have a frame of reference,” he says. “A lot of people will be interested in fashion or photography, but they don’t want to move away. It’s a confidence thing and a sense of inertia that comes with the depression of the place.” Jacob moved to London to do his MA, and is now trying to make a career as an artist in the capital. Tom, 23, believes he would struggle to live and work in his home town of Ilfracombe, north , without support from his parents. “Ilfracombe is a wonderful place to live if you enjoy outdoor sports like I do,” he says. “Every time I go up on the cliffs at sunset I feel extraordinarily grateful to live here. “But there are challenges. There is a distinct lack of job opportunities in the area, and combined with the high cost of housing, it feels almost impossible for someone like me, who grew up here, to have a sustainable living without my parents’ support.” Central Ilfracombe is the most deprived neighbourhood in Devon and among the 20% most deprived areas nationwide, according to the , as reported by Devon Community Foundation. Tom had been looking for jobs in Manchester and Bristol, but secured a temporary position with a local authority close to home, and then landed a permanent role. “I feel very lucky to have a steady and salaried job, as there aren’t many like it here,” he says. “I am living at home, my expenses are very low, and I am saving money, so I could possibly have a deposit a few years down the line, but a lot of people are renting and in low-paid seasonal work, living hand to mouth, so they are just not able to save and are unable to buy a property. In terms of big career prospects, it’s pretty dire. That’s a big problem in these areas, unless you can move away, build a career and then maybe come back.” It’s not just young adults who got in touch. Marty, a teacher from Eastbourne, has two children: one 19-year-old son and a daughter who is at university. “There are no opportunities here for young kids,” she says. “I told my kids you’ve got to go to university, you’ve got to get out. “I have been here 25 years and throughout that time there’s been talk of better transport links – that hasn’t happened. Eastbourne has been ‘the next Brighton’ and ‘up and coming’ without anything actually changing.” As for what Eastbourne will be able to offer her children in the future, she is not optimistic. “I’m glad I brought my kids up here, but I worry about what is there for them as they grow into adulthood. I have to tell them, ‘there’s life beyond the Downs.’”",Jane Clinton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They missed their flight to Istanbul after a botched software upgrade to traffic lights closed the road tunnel to Terminals 2 and 3, causing severe congestion. “We were prevented from using escalators from the tube, then kettled on the packed station forecourt for more than an hour,” she writes. “All this time, the lifts from the platform continued to bring up more passengers, increasing the overcrowding. The public address system was not working, no explanations were given and staff seemed not to have had any relevant training. It was an extremely unpleasant, stressful and somewhat scary experience.” The couple was unable to find a suitable alternative flight so aborted their Turkish mini-break. “Heathrow has rejected our claim for compensation. The dispute resolution service CEDR referred us to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), who told us there is no provision for a case like this,” she says. “We cannot understand how Heathrow can get away with it.” Airlines are subject to strict compensation rules when they are responsible for cancelled or delayed flights – but airports, it seems, are not held to account when technical or service failures ground passengers. which entitles travellers to fixed sums, depending on the distance of their flight and the length of a delay, only applies if the airline is responsible directly or indirectly for the disruption. Airlines also take a hit if there is a problem within the airport, since the same rules require them to feed and accommodate stranded passengers and rebook them for free on to a new flight. The CAA confirmed to me that passengers cannot claim costs or compensation from an airport if they are prevented from reaching their departure gate on time. According to Coby Benson, a consumer rights solicitor at Bott and Co, there is a gap in the law. “Unfortunately, these passengers have no recourse against either the airline or the airport,” he says. “Travel insurance can sometimes help, but the terms of those policies are often very restrictive.” A spokesperson for Stansted said affected passengers should claim from their airline or insurer: “While we understand the frustration felt by affected passengers, the incident was beyond our control. Airlines were informed promptly, but decisions on flight departures rest solely with them.” Heathrow was dismissive of FN’s ordeal, despite of management failures. A source close to the airport said that the closure of the tunnel was temporary and the problem swiftly resolved. It denied that passengers were held in the area for an hour since its contingency measures ensured passenger flow.

Pile crisp coffee meringues high with espresso cream, boozy cherries, a drizzle of whisky caramel and a flicker of edible gold leaf, then shake, spoon and sparkle your way into the New Year. A few tips: arrange the toppings in glass bowls or on tiered trays for a beautiful display, add labels for fun and, if it’s sitting out for a while, keep the whipped cream chilled on ice. For the meringues (make up to 3 days ahead) For the espresso brandy cherries (make up to 3 days ahead) , or coffee liqueur (Kahlúa, Tia Maria or similar) For the whisky caramel (make up to 3 days ahead) For the espresso mascarpone cream (make on the day) To make the meringues, heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 and line two large oven trays with baking paper. In a clean bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites on medium-high to soft peaks. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking until thick, glossy peaks form and the sugar dissolves – test by rubbing a bit of the meringue mix between your fingers: it should feel smooth. Add the coffee, cornflour, vinegar, vanilla and salt, and whisk just to combine. Dab a little meringue under each corner of each sheet of baking paper, so they stick to the trays, then, using two small soup spoons, dollop 12 roughly 5cm-wide rounds on each tray, spacing them well apart because they will double in size when baked. Using the back of a teaspoon, make a shallow dip in the centre of each meringue. Put the trays in the oven and turn down the temperature to 130C (110C fan)/250F/gas ½. Bake for an hour and 15 minutes, until lightly crisp, dry to the touchand still slightly soft inside. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave the meringues to cool completely for about an hour. Store in an airtight container for up to three days. combine the cherries, sugar, coffee and salt in a small saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, stirring so the sugar dissolves, then lower the heat and simmer for five minutes until the cherries are tender and the liquid has reduced slightly. Add the brandy (or coffee liqueur) and vanilla, then take off the heat and leave to cool completely – the syrup will thicken as it stands. Store in a jar in the fridge for up to three days; bring to room temperature before serving. For the whisky caramel, mix the sugar and water in a medium saucepan on a low heat and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat to high, cook without stirring until the caramel turns a deep amber, then take off the heat. Carefully add the cream, then return the pan to a low heat and stir until smooth. Add the whisky, decant into a jug and store in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat in a pan over a low heat before serving. mix all the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-low until soft waves form. Chill until ready to serve. To assemble, arrange the meringues on a plate and dust lightly with cocoa powder. Put the espresso mascarpone cream, brandied cherries and whisky caramel in separate small bowls or jars. You now have a DIY bar from which guests can build their own dish: nestle a meringue in a glass or shallow bowl, spoon in a little cream, top with cherries and finish with a glossy drizzle of caramel.

Anything that helps young people develop a reading habit is welcome. But framing the solution as thrillers versus so-called “masterpieces” risks missing the deeper issue. There needs to be more systemic change in how schools think about boys’ reading rather than simply swapping one set of books for another. In my experience as an English teacher, despite having access to more books than ever before, schools often see books with glorified violence at the centre as “boy books”, and so fill the curriculum with this content. This does nothing to combat toxic masculinity – rather, it fosters it. We shouldn’t patronise boys by telling them what society thinks they should become, but instead give them a bit more credit in their reading interests. I’ve had plenty of young men tearing up in my classroom when reading Jane Eyre. Encouraging kids to read this kind of book won’t solve the entire problem, but it will certainly help in making more well-rounded young men. How I agree with Lee Child. In the late 1970s I was teaching English to a very unmotivated year 10 group in a rural comprehensive school in Lincolnshire. To encourage them to read, we bought a set of novels and had a weekly shared reading lesson. We had to feign disappointment when, nearly at the end of the novel, a group of them broke into the stock cupboard and stole copies so that they could find out what happened next. Success!

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/sale-harlequins-prem-rugby-match-report,Jacques Vermeulen on song as Sale batter Harlequins in second half,2025-12-26T19:57:13.000Z,"Flanker scores two tries to help hosts romp to victory Of all the indignities heaped on this season, and goodness knows there have been a few, this Christmas stuffing was perhaps the most humiliating. Leading 17-12 at the interval against a side who had lost their last four in the Prem, they succumbed so meekly that Jason Gilmore, their senior coach, was forced to question their collective desire. This abject surrender came just six days after Quins were thumped 40-14 by Bristol at Twickenham. “The boys care for the club – but there’s a difference between caring for the club and doing something about it,” the Queenslander said pointedly after his players conceded 31 second-half points without reply. “We will be looking hard at the squad in terms of what next year looks like.” After a sixth defeat from eight in the league, Quins can almost certainly forget about the playoffs. But things are finally looking up again for Sale, who reduced their visitors to so much rubble with five second-half tries. Sale’s recent dismal league run, culminating in a 47-21 defeat at Northampton last weekend, prompted the club’s wealthy owners to meet Alex Sanderson and his players. The basic message from Simon and Michelle Orange was “raise your game” and it was heeded. At half-time, though, surely not even Sanderson, a positive person by nature, could have foreseen his side winning so convincingly. “I’m quite emotional now actually but the owners have been really supportive,” said Sale’s director of rugby. “I just thought we were physically brilliant all game. We were down on the scoreboard at half-time, but that didn’t represent the physical dominance we had in that first half. “It was a case of ‘more of the same, please’ and sometimes the plan just comes together, so I couldn’t be prouder of the lads. We desperately needed the win but could I have seen that second half coming? Not the scoreline. “It blew out but I thought we were good value for the win. Even though we were 17-12 down at half-time, the lads stuck at it and they got their reward.” If they could not beat another side struggling so badly in Quins, could Sale really consider themselves ready to start climbing the table? It was a nightmarish start, though, for Sanderson and his players as Quins led early on when Marcus Smith dived over from close range. Smith converted but Sale steadied themselves and hit back in the eighth minute with a slick try from Alex Wills from Rob du Preez’s exquisite long pass. George Ford missed the conversion but his intricate probing came increasingly to the fore for Sale, who had their second try when their England and Lions hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie went over from close range. Jack Walker’s close-range effort – and Smith’s conversion – put the visitors 17-12 up at the break but there was an impressive physicality about Sale and they were rewarded in spades during a ludicrously one-sided second half. The flanker Jacques Vermeulen produced two smart tries to secure the bonus point and Sale, self-belief coursing through their veins, began to move through the gears in devastating fashion. Centre Rekeiti Ma’asi-White finished off some delightful handling for their fifth before scrum-half Raffi Quirke pounced on an awful error from Smith to score Sale’s sixth. Quirke chased his own kick and Smith, inside his own in-goal area, dithered and allowed the ball to bounce beyond him, inviting Sale’s scrum-half to pounce and score. It was a sweet moment for Quirke, who was switched to the wing at the end of the first half after Tom O’Flaherty moved to full-back to replace Joe Carpenter. Smith was taunted by the home stands and, when they chanted “Marcus, Marcus, give us a wave” he responded, much to the delight of the Sale fans. There was still time for the replacement hooker Nathan Jibulu to crash over from close range amid scenes of mounting euphoria. But for Quins the problems continue to mount.",Ross Heppenstall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Many other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancy , there are still a few choices to make. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release of We combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors. We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance. The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices. I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – The base-model iPhone has been the best for most people for years, but this year the iPhone 17 is closer to the Pro models in features than ever before, making it an instant recommendation. While it may not look that different from last year’s iPhone 16, the screen has finally been upgraded to bring it up to par with the Pro iPhones. It is a 6.3in super-bright OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate – double previous standard iPhones – and ensures day-to-day scrolling and animations are smoother and more fluid than ever before. The screen’s glass is stated as being three times tougher than previous models, while the always-on display mode shows the time, notifications and music when idle – another feature that was Pro-only until now. The rest of the iPhone 17 is fairly standard. It has the latest rapid A19 chip, but with twice the starting storage at 256GB of its predecessor – which should be more than enough for most people. The battery lasts just shy of two days between charges, and it fast-charges via USB-C or MagSafe/Qi2 wireless charging. The phone is still relatively light and compact for a modern smartphone, with aluminium sides and a glass front and back, and it arrives with an IP68 water-resistance rating (down to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes). Along the edge of the device you’ll find the recently added action and camera control buttons, as well as the standard power and volume buttons. Sporting main and ultra-wide options, the iPhone 17’s dual 48MP rear camera shoots great photos and videos across a range of lighting conditions, including automatic portrait capture and a fun macrophotography mode for closeups. It lacks a telephoto camera, however, limited to a 2x crop zoom on the main camera with digital zoom on top. A new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera on the front has some fancy tricks. It can automatically pan and zoom to fit in everyone for group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies while being held in portrait orientation. as the rest of the iPhone family, which introduces Apple’s new glass-like design, improved spam filters and several other features. It also has Apple’s AI tools, which still lag behind the competition. The biggest downside is that in a year where every other iPhone has had a redesign, the iPhone 17 looks the same as last year’s model. The iPhone 17 offers almost everything that’s great about Apple’s Pro phones, including 256GB of storage, solid battery life, a fancy new screen and rapid performance, but in a lighter, cheaper package. you want a great iPhone experience you want optical zoom on your camera or a new design 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) 71.5 x 7.95 x 149.6mm (WDH) The iPhone 17 Pro takes all the good bits from the standard iPhone 17 and slaps them into a new design that stands out over years of similar-looking models from Apple. It shares the same super-bright, 120Hz 6.3in OLED screen as the iPhone 17, but in a new aluminium unibody with smoother edges. A new camera “plateau” covers the full width of the top quarter of the phone’s rear, with a glass panel inlaid below it for wireless charging and magnetic accessories. New dark blue and bright orange colour options help it stand out, and despite its 204g weight, the 17 Pro remains pretty compact for a phone this capable. Housing Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip with a cooling system to allow it to run at peak performance for longer, the new Pro is great for games and other intensive tasks. Basic storage starts at 256GB, and the battery lasts about 42 hours between charges with general use. It fast-charges to 70% in 30 minutes via USB-C and supports 25W Qi2 wireless charging. The biggest feature upgrade over the regular iPhone 17 is the Pro’s camera system. It’s made up of three 48MP sensors, including a larger main camera and a new 4x telephoto camera, which offers a 2x crop zoom to hit an effective 8x optical zoom to close the distance to objects. Combined, they capture excellent photos across a range of lighting conditions and environments. On the front, you’ll find the 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera for easy group shots. This is Apple’s best phone, with a new aluminium unibody design, its most powerful camera and top performance, all in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket. you want a new design and the best camera in an iPhone but don’t want a huge display you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhone 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing 71.9 x 8.75 x 150mm (WDH) The iPhone 17 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest and most expensive model this year. Super-sizing the regular 17 Pro, it has a massive 6.9in OLED screen on the front and a huge battery in the back. Design-wise, it sports the same new aluminium unibody and top-performing A19 Pro chip of the new models, and a glorious screen that makes it excellent for gaming. It comes with at least 256GB of storage with options up to 2TB, great for those who want to use its triple rear camera for movie-making. Standout, though, is the Pro Max’s battery life, which at about 55 hours of general use will see the phone last well into a third day without needing a top-up. The result of that extra capacity is that the 17 Pro Max is both huge and heavy. It would definitely benefit from using a to help keep hold of it. Apple’s longest-lasting, largest phone comes packing a powerful camera, top performance and everything good from the regular-sized 17 Pro. you want super-long battery life and a massive screen you want a smaller, lighter or cheaper device 6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing 78 x 8.75 x. 163.4mm (WDH) The iPhone Air is a bit of a wildcard in the current Apple phone lineup. It is an entirely new model built to be the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made. The bulk of the body is just 5.64mm thick, although it feels even thinner thanks to its rounded titanium sides. It weighs only 165g – 12g lighter than the already light iPhone 17 – but it also has a large, bright and 120Hz-smooth 6.5in OLED screen. It’s the kind of device that deserves to be used without a case, immediately feeling special the moment you pick it up. On the rear, the camera plateau that stretches across the top of the device is also home to the phone’s components, with the rest of the body dedicated to the battery. It still has a version of Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip, at least 256GB of storage, and runs iOS 26 with all the features. The super-slender frame creates three downsides for the Air. First, its battery lasts about 40 hours of general use, which isn’t terrible, but it’s shorter than other iPhones. Second, it doesn’t have a nano Sim slot, relying entirely on downloadable eSims for connection to a phone provider. While most of the major networks support eSims, not all in the UK do, especially the more budget-friendly providers. However, the biggest compromise is that it only has a single 48MP camera on the rear, with no ultra-wide or telephoto options. While it still takes excellent photos, if you can’t walk back and forth to zoom in or out from your subject, you won’t be able to get the shot. You still get the new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 line, though. The iPhone Air is an exquisite piece of hardware that offers a big screen without the bulk or weight. you want thinness above all else you want long battery life, multiple cameras or you can’t get an eSim 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) 74.7 x 5.64 x 156.2mm (WDH) The cheapest new phone sold by Apple is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to the , but with a more modern design and chip. It has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a decent 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from . It’s thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and is water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones. Inside sits 2024’s A18 chip, paired with at least 128GB of storage. This hardware enables the Apple Intelligence features found across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup – capabilities that won’t run on the iPhone 15 and older models – although none have as yet emerged as true killer features. The iPhone 16e will last up to two days of general use and charges via USB-C. However, it lacks a few features common to other iPhones, including the Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories and charging, Wifi 7, and a handful of other specs. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is decent but lacks any ultra-wide or telephoto options. Despite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 17, the 16e still isn’t cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money. The 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with a fast chip and AI, but with features such as a dual camera and MagSafe missing to hit a lower price. you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessories 71.5 x 7.8 x 146.7mm (WDH) The iPhone 16, released in 2024, sports the same design as the current iPhone 17, but misses the new Pro-grade screen and Centre Stage selfie camera. The rear camera is slightly lower grade, and storage capacity is smaller too. It was and will continue to receive about five to six years of software support – but it’s fairly expensive at an If your iPhone is running slow or the battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, there may be something you can do. in settings. If it’s past its best, a replacement costs , or cheaper through third parties, and will give your iPhone a new lease of life. To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space. If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’s , so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receive is better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing. There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished and that come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less. Several third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chains also have a wide range. And some phone operators, including The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows: – virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive. – in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories. – in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories. – also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts. Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s: – batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced? – check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break. – do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix. – is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty. – check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another. – not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance. – check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against a – what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/26/arne-slot-believes-best-is-yet-to-come-as-liverpool-look-to-end-set-piece-failings,Arne Slot believes ‘best is yet to come’ as Liverpool look to end set-piece failings,2025-12-26T13:30:09.000Z,"‘Difference between us and other teams is too small’ Liverpool have conceded 11 league goals from set pieces Arne Slot has claimed Liverpool have much more to offer this season and can become the dominant team he envisaged, although only once their set-piece failings have been eradicated. Liverpool have stemmed a damaging sequence of – the club’s worst run in 71 years – to climb to fifth in the Premier League, level with fourth-placed Chelsea. But Slot, who admits Liverpool’s position remains below expectations, insists he will not get carried away by an unbeaten run of six matches because the team’s performance level requires big improvement. “We are in the position we deserve after the first half of the season,” said the Liverpool head coach, who will be without the suspended Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexander Isak, , against Wolves on Saturday. “I think we should be higher, let that be clear – I was expecting and hoping for us to be higher in the table – but even in the last six games the difference between us and the other team is constantly too small. “Now we have been a few times a bit lucky with the result [against Tottenham and Brighton] and we need to find a situation where we are so much better than the other team that luck or bad luck does not influence it any more. I think the games we have lost were unlucky. Referees and set pieces have had an incredible impact on the start of our season, but we should not have that as an excuse. That should not lead to us dropping points. We need to make sure like last season when a lot of decisions went against us as well but it didn’t hurt us.” Slot is adamant the Premier League champions will improve in the second half of the season. However, he admits must rectify problems with set pieces at both ends to make progress. Only Bournemouth (12) have conceded more set-piece goals in the league this season than Liverpool (11), and while Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all scored 10 set-piece goals in the Premier League, Slot’s team have scored three. “Players are getting fitter and fitter, not only the ones we brought in but also the ones who missed out in pre-season,” Slot said. “They are getting used to each other. I think the best is still to come for this team. “If you look at what has happened in the first half [of the season] then I am not so surprised where we are. If you look at our set-piece balance, there is not one team in the world that is minus eight in set pieces and is still joint-fourth in the league. If you find that team please tell me. From open play we are the number-one team in the league for chance creation but I don’t think anyone sees it because I think in general we are criticised a lot. That is true if you simply look at the results, but if you were to exclude the set pieces then the world would look completely different and we would probably be five or six points higher. “People say: ‘What are you talking about? Set pieces are part of the game.’ Of course it is part of football but it is a different element within the game, you could say. The fundamental is the football itself and set pieces are an add-on. But set pieces have such an immense impact on a football game and also on the league table.”",Andy Hunter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/26/dog-turns-five-affections-remain-sweet-mystery,Our dog’s affections remain a sweet mystery even as Odie turns five today,2025-12-26T14:00:13.000Z,"Dog and human finding companionship is understandable – what baffles us is why Odie seeks out our eldest son’s bed even when he’s not home And who does your dog love the most?” my friend laughingly asks my youngest child as she fusses over Odie, our cavoodle. The dog is delighted by the attention and the prospect of yet another person succumbing to puppy love and furnishing a treat. The child, though, has some thinking to do. It’s a bit like being asked by a well-meaning adult, “What do you want to be when you grow up?”, a question that calls for balancing the wings of hope against the burden of reality. “Oh, that’s easy,” my son smiles, bless his heart. “Odie loves my mum the most.” His explanation is both reason and excuse. “Because we got him as a baby when she was on a sabbatical. She fed him three times a day and when she studied, he sat under her desk. She took him everywhere in a shoebox.” Then the key piece of intelligence, “She also takes him for the most walks.” My boy forgets to add that I am the person most likely to throw Odie into the laundry sink for a wash seize the opportunity to scrub his teeth despite his protests. “Well, that makes sense,” says my friend before persevering. “Then who does he love after that?” A growl ensues from the kitchen and it’s not the dog. to love me,” corrects my daughter emphatically, “but now he prefers my older brother. I don’t even know why.” There is wry truth in those words. When I am around, Odie keeps me in his line of vision. He is a tripping hazard outside the bathroom. In the wardrobe, he plays a guessing game in his head – is it walk or work? (what else could there be?) If I am writing in bed, he pushes up against my laptop. And when I take a micro nap, he simply fits it into his all-day nap. In the early days, when I left home, Odie used to bolt into my daughter’s room in the mornings and launch himself on to her before licking her face. One reason could be that her door is ajar so he can push it open with his little paw. Her siblings make sure that their door is firmly closed against such pet invasions. She would push him aside and he would snuggle contentedly into the crook of her knees. She said that was okay but flinging himself across her body to pin her under the blanket was not on. Quite possibly, Odie tired of the complaining (albeit good natured) and plotted his next move with some passive-aggressive tendencies. He left my daughter for my oldest son. He is at university, so his hours are less structured than school days. When we are gone, he is sometimes still sleeping or studying. Being tall, he has the most spacious bed of the kids. Odie has developed a distinct fondness for said bed and its occupant. Now, in the morning, when he has calculated from my work attire that his chance of squeezing in a walk is zero, Odie pads up to my son’s door. He used to employ a short bark to be let in but now, he sits quietly and expectantly, having learnt that as penance for going to work, I will find him a new babysitter. On my son’s bed, Odie finds any number of favourable positions: jammed between his long legs, leaning against his knees, resting on his shins, or finding his own little corner of the big bed. Dog and human finding companionship is understandable, but what leaves us scratching our head is why Odie seeks out our eldest’s bed even when he is not home. When we have left Odie alone, we know exactly where to find him resting dolefully. Truth be told, this is the rank favouritism that vexes us. It couldn’t be the walks or treats, we think, but out of all of us, he does have the gentlest manner with the dog. He is the most likely to greet Odie with the words, “Stay, I come in peace”: I reckon the dog appreciates peaceful co-existence. “Odie, why don’t you love me like the others? What have I done? I take you for walks, I give you treats, why don’t you love me?” Four nights out of seven, you will hear this slightly desperate appeal from my youngest child to the dog as he lies across my feet, opens one tired eye and grumbles at the unwarranted intrusion. But then, as my child continues, Odie opens both eyes and licks my son on every free surface. At such times, I wonder if he is thinking, “Quit the melodrama, man. I love you just as much as the others.” My youngest son complains that Odie never sleeps on his bed and squeals to be let out. This much is true although Odie does love to jump into his lap to umpire endless games of Fifa. I wonder if his dog brain still remembers being lost in my son’s bedroom when we just got him. Home alone for some time, he had wriggled out of his pen. I had shouted the house down in panic, but he didn’t yet know how to respond to his name. What does a dog make of its owners? that dog’s brains are begging to be analysed. Just look around your local dog park to see why. Apparently, canine intelligence comes in many forms. Odie turns five today. I don’t know if his love has a pecking order and if so, what dog metrics he uses to reach the conclusion. But how wonderful that we will never know, which leaves us all with an ongoing invitation to “ Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/22/is-it-true-that-you-can-sweat-out-a-hangover,Is it true that … you can sweat out a hangover?,2025-12-22T08:00:22.000Z,"It’s the liver – not the skin – that rids the body of the toxins in alcohol, but exercise can help manage the symptoms ere’s a useful fact to quote to any smug relatives who say they went for a run the morning after their Christmas party: you can’t get rid of toxins by sweating. “Toxins” is a broad term, says Adam Taylor, professor of anatomy at Lancaster Medical School, covering anything that can damage the body – from heavy metals to chemicals found in plastics, as well as the normal byproducts of our own metabolism. The liver is designed to process the toxins in alcohol and either break them down into usable units or get rid of them. The waste products are then filtered from the blood and excreted in urine or stools. Sweat, on the other hand, has a very different job. Although it can contain extremely small amounts of some metabolic byproducts, its purpose is temperature regulation (and, in some situations, to signal stress or fear). “Sweating is not the means to remove toxins,” says Taylor. “Going for a run or sitting in a sauna after a night of drinking won’t reduce the toxins produced by metabolising alcohol, and it won’t lower your blood alcohol level.” In fact, there is no way to speed up alcohol detoxification. Each person metabolises it at a fairly fixed rate. So why does hitting the gym or sitting in a sauna feel good when you’re hungover? Both activities are known to boost endorphins – the body’s natural “feelgood” chemicals – and to reduce cortisol, which can leave us feeling anxious or on edge. They also improve circulation, relax tight muscles and stimulate the “rest and digest” part of the nervous system, all of which can make recovery feel easier. But this is about managing symptoms, not accelerating detoxification. If you choose to do something to make you sweat when you’re hungover, make hydration a priority, says Taylor. “Alcohol depletes water from the body, and sweating increases fluid loss, raising the risk of dehydration and tissue inflammation.”",Kate Lloyd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you consider that more than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goes – and heating the person, rather than the whole home – seems like a good idea. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 4p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits. Electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, with the most convenient examples arriving with timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy. Heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa – they’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton. I was tasked with sleeping on the job to discover the best of both, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown and Dreamland. Here are my top picks. Carmen C81190 fitted electric blanket (double) Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket (king size) Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvet (king size) I’ve been a lifestyle journalist for more than two decades. Over the years, I’ve tested everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully, not all at the same time. Lately, my focus has been bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen – so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step. Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon. Without a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 20 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and judge its quality and durability. Alongside measuring the max temperature each blanket hit, I timed how long it took to get there – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I measured the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. Since the weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C. No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I considered how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on the as of 1 January 2026, which is 27.69p a kWh. best of the 20 models I tested. Those blankets and throws that brands didn’t want returned will be donated to – a Bournemouth-based charity supporting local families in need. This electric blanket includes two controllers so you can operate each side of the bed independently – always a good thing when you’re sharing. It comes in both double and king-size versions, and is made from polyester with a cosy fleece finish. The Carmen feels great, heats up effectively and is great value. It’s one of the easiest blankets to fit on to your bed, with a generous elastic skirt sewn on to it rather than the usual, clumsier straps. The skirt ensures the blanket secures neatly under each side of the It heats up quickly, reaching an impressive 28.1C in its centre after just 10 minutes – and this was without a duvet on top. I measured the heat at the sides a little cooler, but the temperature increased steadily over an hour, reaching 30.2C in its centre after 30 minutes and up to 33C after an hour. As soon as a duvet was placed on top, it got even warmer and retained its heat effectively long after I had turned off the blanket. While it’s machine washable, the manufacturer recommends you only do this a total of three times in its lifespan, so it will mostly be a spot clean. there’s no timer. But for peace of mind, it does have overheat protection that will automatically shut it down if the built-in thermal fuse detects a hotspot or fault in the heated cables. no, but it does have auto-shut off Generous straps for easy positioning and three adjustable heat settings make this electric blanket a good budget buy. It comes in six sizes, can be machine washed for easy maintenance, and arrives with a two-year guarantee. Feeling super soft against the skin, this microfibre blanket was simple to set up, with bonus points awarded for the long cord. The lengthy, elasticated straps meant I didn’t have to wrestle too much with the corners of my thick Sealy mattress to position the blanket securely, plus it stayed in place nicely. The blanket heated up to 22.1C in just 10 minutes and 25C in 30 minutes. After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me. When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat. it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night. , double (currently out of stock), king (currently out of stock), The king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours. This blanket reached 22C at its centre after just 10 minutes, and within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. I found that the middle and end of the blanket heated well, but the top section remained cool to the touch, working well for under your head. It costs more than your average electric blanket, but is worth it for the quilted, breathable bamboo finish. The filling, like many other electric blankets, is polyester. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, even when I was sleepy-eyed. there are no timer options between three and nine hours. yes, one, three or nine hours Ideal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has a soft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in a The soft-to-touch surface of this heated blanket proved just the right level of cosy for a night on the sofa watching . Plus, it feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets. It heated up fast – reaching temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes – yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was more comfortable. Its three-hour automatic switch-off timer means that you can just set and forget about it. it didn’t heat up evenly. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all – which might be a problem if you’re sharing it with a blanket hog. This smooth fleece blanket comes in three attractive colours – taupe, charcoal and navy – to match most neutral decor schemes. A handheld digital LED controller allows you to flick between its six heat levels. For less than £35, this heated throw is good value – and at this price, you could even buy it as a gift. The deep navy colour looked great on my sofa, and while it’s not the fluffiest heated throw I’ve tested, it felt lovely to touch – neither too thick nor too heavy. It was the perfect size for one person – and will just about cater for two, if you’re willing to snuggle up close. The blanket warmed up steadily, reaching a comfortable temperature at its max. After 10 minutes on its full heat setting, it measured 19.7C at the centre. An hour in on full power, this rose to 40.3C. While heat wasn’t evenly distributed, this didn’t make much difference to the overall feeling of warmth. it doesn’t have a timer, other than a four-hour automatic shut-off, but you’ll need to make sure you switch it off using the controller and at the plug after use. no, but automatic shut-off after four hours With its soft microfleece finish, this heated blanket is large enough to cover one person comfortably and also works well for two. It features one digital control panel with multiple heat and timer functions, and an automatic switch-off function for peace of mind. If you intend to sleep with it, Russell Hobbs recommends using it on a lower heat mode, up to setting three. The first thing I noticed about this heated blanket, aside from its soft feel, was its generous 250cm cable. It meant I could drape the blanket over me comfortably on the sofa without accidentally tugging the plug out of the wall socket. The blanket’s microfleece finish felt tactile and comforting, and it was thicker than some of the standard fleece throws I tested, such as the Dunelm fleece electric throw (above). While I could feel the wiring lines inside this blanket, they’re well hidden in the blanket’s sumptuous design. The white digital control panel here is a little bulkier than some others on test, and stands out against the jet-black finish of the blanket I tested. Nevertheless, it was easy to use, with heat settings ranging from one to nine. If you want to use the blanket for more than an hour, the timer function lets you go up in one-hour increments up to nine hours and then jumps to a single 12-hour setting. On its highest heat setting it reached 29C in 30 minutes and a toasty 41.9C after an hour. In addition, the heat seemed to distribute well across the blanket’s surface. the throw doesn’t come in pastel colours; the darker shades (such as the black I tested) could look harsh against some softer interior schemes. Available in a choice of jewel-like colours, including deep pink, “scuba” blue and green, this electric over-blanket is reasonably priced at less than £50 (£35.99 at the time of writing). The blanket is made from polyester and has a white fluffy trim that contrasts nicely against the vibrant hue of its main body. It may be standard polyester, but the velvety fleece-like finish of this blanket feels luxurious to touch. Its white trim instantly made my sofa look festive, but it will look great throughout spring, too, adding an extra layer of cosiness to your living room. It’s thick and feels more substantial than some other budget heated blankets I’ve tried, so it feels warming even when it’s not switched on. It heated up quickly, too, and within a minute there was a satisfying amount of heat from its centre. The heat felt comfortable rather than scorching, with the heated wires nicely disguised within the throw. The heat also radiates out to the sides effectively, providing an even warmth across the surface. After 10 minutes, I measured the centre of the blanket at 27.2C on its highest setting, and it reached 34.2C after 30 minutes and a sleep-inducing 40.3C after an hour. The control panel is easy to use and doesn’t give you a bewildering number of heat and timer options – there are six heat settings and a three-hour timer, which feels plenty. It comes with the safety of an auto-shut-off feature and can be conveniently machine-washed at 30C too – both features I’d expect to find in a good-quality heated blanket. it doesn’t come with a storage bag, which would make it neater to store while not in use. It’s hard to fault this blanket, though, as it’s such good value. Dreamland offers a wide range of heated bedding products – I also have my eye on the brand’s for specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands. Having tried the underblanket (reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet would compare. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable with the controller removed, and can be tumble-dried, too. I was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed, under a breathable cotton The dual controls lead out at the end of the duvet, so you can run them up the side of the bed to plug it in. This means you’ll be able to use it with a buttoned cover, but not one that has a zip. Dreamland states the heat-up time as five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature at 26.6C at the centre, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable – although this probably isn’t a heat level I’d like to sleep in all night. The duvet’s dual controls worked well for my partner and me: I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all. it doesn’t come with a cover. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath. yes, one, three and nine hours With nine temperature settings, this soft and silky pink blanket offers a good range of heat options up to a maximum of 43C. It has a one-hour default timer, plus one that can be set for up to nine hours in total. If you’re going to sleep with it or are using it for extended periods, VonHaus recommends setting the heat to level one for the duration. Measuring 160 x 130cm, I found this heated blanket just the right size for one. While its vibrant pink finish might not go down so well with some, personally, I didn’t mind it. It’s machine washable at 30C (with the control panel removed) on a gentle cycle and low spin, and the 2.15m cord length should be long enough to reach a nearby socket. The blanket felt smooth underhand with an almost silk-like finish, but I could feel the wiring inside. Nevertheless, it was subtle, and the blanket’s layers of fabric are well structured to make it easy to fold or lay flat on the sofa or bed. It heated up evenly, but not as quickly or as hot as others on test, reaching 25.5C within 30 minutes and 34C after an hour. the pink colourway may not to be everyone’s taste. This heated cushion, made by German brand Beurer, would make an excellent gift. Of its two sides, it’s the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 fleecy fabric that warms up for a soothing effect; the other side is a breathable cotton with a removable pad inside. The cover is removable and machine washable on a gentle wool cycle at 30C, but it can only be cleaned up to 10 times in its lifespan. For an extra £9.99, in five attractive colours, including green, red and orange. An alternative option to your standard heated throw, this cushion provides a more targeted approach to warming and could work well for general pain relief. It comes with three heat settings, and felt great positioned near the lower back and under the neck, upper legs, knees and ankles. The cushion was super-quick to heat, reaching 34C in 10 minutes, and a very warm 43.4C after an hour. It never really felt too hot, and the heat seemed to radiate to the sides nicely. The three heat settings are useful, but a timer alongside would have enhanced the design. That said, it does come with a 90-minute auto-shut-off feature. the control panel isn’t a little more hi-tech, but it does the job effectively. no, but it has 90-minute auto-switch off : 0.6p/hour – less than 1p (0.023kWh) the cover is machine washable at 30C wool cycle; the inner pad is not washable those looking for a stylish, neutral colour This heated throw looks elegant and feels luxurious – just as the name suggests. My review sample arrived in the Mole colourway, which will suit both modern and traditional interiors. The blanket’s 10 heat settings allow for good control, although I found it difficult to “feel” a difference past heat setting six. The blanket reached a hot 31.9C after 10 minutes of being turned on; and while the borders didn’t get as warm, the heat did seem evenly distributed across the surface. Made from polyester, the blanket is washable at 40C on a wool cycle, but it can only be air-dried. when you turn it on, it starts at setting five. It would make more sense if it started at setting one. couples who share a bed and can’t agree on temperature With a sustainable 180-thread-count pure cotton cover, the surface of this electric blanket is luxuriously soft and breathable, while the quilted finish adds extra padding and warmth to the mattress before the blanket is even turned on. The fastening straps for the corners and the blanket’s base material ensure a secure fit to the mattress. There are two control panels that let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body. On the highest setting, the blanket radiated an even temperature that felt even warmer once I added my duvet. it may have a pure cotton cover, but its filling is made from polyester. smaller sofas and people who don’t want to share A simple control panel with nine heat settings adjust the temperature of this heated throw, which reached just over 33C after an hour of being plugged in. There’s no timer, but it turns off automatically after two hours, which should be more than long enough to warm you up. The throw is thin and light, so it would be good for transitional seasons when the weather is a little warmer and you don’t want anything too heavy. The box says it costs 1p an hour to run on the lowest setting, which sounds about right – I measured it as 3p an hour on maximum. it’s quite thin, meaning you can feel the wiring inside. In my tests, the average king-size electric blanket costs 3p an hour to run. This shows that even if used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course. “There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert at . “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.” Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. Expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw. Electric blankets should be used with caution, and never by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend use by young children, unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Not always obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Look for safety marks such as “ ” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “ safety tested” for peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety, Consider safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that will turn off the blanket after a set time, or overheat protection, which switches off the device if it senses it’s getting too hot. An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, starting just below the area beneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed. Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but can potentially cause damage to some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser at “Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures for this to be an issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.” This article was originally published on 27 December 2024.

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/24/best-movie-moments-2025,Dancing! Fighting! Impregnating! The best movie moments of 2025,2025-12-24T11:01:16.000Z,"From Sinners to F1 to Highest 2 Lowest, Guardian writers pick the scenes that stuck with them the most this year Disclosure: I covered auto racing for years and still follow Formula One skeptically. I definitely went into knowing what I was in for, an answer to the hypothetical: what if the bougiest sport on God’s green earth was turned into a western? But you can’t help going along for the ride once Brad Pitt starts filling the frame with his blue-eyed winks, wry smiles and Butch Cassidy swagger. I should’ve been more indignant about this martinet sport making a literal hero out of the biggest rogue on the grid. But I left disbelief in parc fermé as Pitt’s Sonny Hayes bumped and nicked his way to the season finale at Abu Dhabi to much consternation before his wingman (Damson Idris) takes up the ticky tactics at Yas Marina circuit and winds up sacrificing himself and producer Lewis Hamilton ( !) to help Sonny win his first race and thwart a hostile takeover of their fragile team. And when the lights went up at my desolate midday screening, it was just me still on the edge of my seat and my disbelief still firmly off track. Where to start? Jos Safdie’s ping-pong epic is fitted out with one brilliantly imagined sequence after another, any of which could qualify as the year’s best. The death camp honey-licking? The orange-ball sales pitch? The Chalamet ass-whipping? The ping-pong club as mob lounge? You’re spoiling us, Mr Safdie. But I think on balance the most eye-popping bit of all is, of all things, its animated opening credits sequence, which follows, shall we say, a spermatozoa race to the ovum, a pseudo-real version of what Woody Allen got up to in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex. This takes its cue from what’s just happened in the film’s opening scene, and ties in (without giving too much away) to its ending. It’s been a long time since I felt my jaw actually drop slightly in a cinema; if nothing else, it tips you off that something ... unusual ... is on its way. Plenty of us saw something of the silent comic in Josh O’Connor when he tramped around in La Chimera, and this year, in Wake Up Dead Man he was able to leap triumphantly into physical comedy. But as hapless heistman JB in Kelly Reichardt’s beautiful The Mastermind he is a very appealingly low-key kind of clown. JB is an everyman reaching for an easy win, a little chap hindered by his own ineptitude, and beset by forces beyond his control. In particular, I loved the sequence in which he labours up a rickety ladder in a dark pigsty to stash his pilfered paintings in a hay loft. The camera lingers on the wobbling ladder, the snuffling hog always in sight while JB huffs and puffs. You just know that ladder is going to fall, which tells us so much about the likely success of his entire plan. Sooner or later, slapstick Sisyphus is going to end up flat on his back in the pigshit. I’m often indifferent to music performances in a movie; they rarely cast the same spell that live music does. Midway through Ryan Coogler’s 1930s vampire thriller , though, Sammie (Miles Caton) sings an original song, I Lied to You, at his cousins’ juke joint opening night, and what at first seems like a standard party interlude becomes a seductive and sublime centerpiece moment. With cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s Imax aspect ratio choice and Caton’s deep, buttery voice, the room begins to bend around Sammie, his talents suspending the laws of physics. In what feels like one sumptuous, swirling shot, then appears a futuristic Bootsy-Collins-type figurer, a Zaouli dancer, a DJ, Memphis jookin dancers, a ballerina – Black ancestors and descendants of the partygoers appearing under one roof, summoned by Sammie’s song. “This music is ours,” legendary harmonica player Delta Slim tells Sammie in a flashback – “we brought this with us from home.” It’s a risk taken by Coogler that pays off handsomely as we’re given an inebriating taste of transcendence. Watching it for the first time in a crowded theater, I felt every person lock in in a way that now seems meta: relishing in art and feeling its rapture and defiance. Like Slim said: “It’s sacred and big.” In late summer of this year, I briefly took a break from bemoaning the death of the big-screen comedy. That break lasted around 104 minutes as I found myself actually audibly laughing in a cinema at the self-billed “unromantic comedy” Splitsville. It was a film that managed to be both absurdly silly and neatly relatable, a chaotic but thoughtful yet deranged look at straight couples navigating the brave new world of non-monogamy. There were many great small gags but it was the ridiculously extended fight between the central friends turned rivals, played by the film’s writers Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, that has truly stuck for me. Post-Bridget Jones it became an easy joke to poke fun at polite middle-class men engaging in fisticuffs without knowing what to do and when this one starts with a slap, one might expect the same, now very tired routine. But instead we see two men who know what they’re doing, albeit messily, proceed to destroy their friendship and the beautiful house around them, a spectacularly violent, and seriously well-directed, set piece. It serves as an early, unhinged reminder that behind the sleekly designed, smugly progressive sheen of certain “modern” couples lies pettiness, rage and a desire to drown your best friend in a bathtub full of fish. For weeks, I have been imploring those close to me to see ’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel, which proves that sometimes, a great ending can save an OK movie. Zhao’s film on Shakespeare’s domestic life pre-Hamlet struggles to balance sylvan fairytale with brutal, beautiful realism – I was put off by the remote romance between William (Paul Mescal) and Agnes (Jessie Buckley), then riveted by the unsparing horror of their child’s final hours, then tepid on the biopic-esque treatments of grief. But the ending! The stellar, knockout, bravura ending, in which – light spoilers ahead – Agnes attends the inaugural performance of Hamlet at the Globe, saves the whole thing, and accomplishes the stunning feat of briefly collapsing time. Watching the title character face death, Agnes reaches for her late son; the audience, moved by the performance, reaches for the departing prince; and we, watching a new imagining of a 425-year-old play, reach toward the same question that has dogged all humans, always: how do you endure, when to live means to lose the ones we love? I left in tears, reminded again that such reaching – for others, for the lost, for connection, for a moment of transcendence through great art – is really all we have. Right in the middle of Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest opus, after years living an incognito, marijuana-saturated life far away from anything, the heat descends on former revolutionary Pat Calhoun in the form of a militarized team reminiscent of Ice stormtroopers, and it’s time for him to run like hell. Crawling through a homemade spider hole, Pat emerges yards away from his house, eventually grabs a burner phone, gets help from his teenage daughter’s ready-for-anything martial arts instructor (played charmingly by Benicio del Toro), attempts multiple times to call up his former revolutionary outlaws (but gets rebuffed because he can’t remember the password), wanders through an immigration raid (orchestrated to give cover to the operation to abduct Pat), leaps across rooftops, and trips over his own two feet at least half a dozen times. On one level this chase is extraordinary film-making, choreographed like a ballet and an exercise in pathos, high-wire thrills and absurd comedy all rolled into one, but on another level it’s absolutely prescient in a way that only movies can be, documenting so much of what it feels like to live in a would-be authoritarian America in 2025. It’s also a showcase for late-stage Leonardo DiCaprio and the absolutely thick chemistry that he has with Del Toro. In its seeming endlessness, its paranoid capacity to bring together things that shouldn’t be combined but are, its slapstick energy, and its finger-on-the-pulse realness, this segment of seems destined to be remembered. It was the best part of one of the best movies of the year, and something I’m going to be thinking about for a long time to come. The first half or so of Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest takes place mostly in the rarified world of David King, a wealthy, respected, gregarious but stubborn music mogul played by Denzel Washington. He lives in a Dumbo penthouse with his family, travels by private car, and has a skyscraping office in Manhattan. Lee captures all of this with clear, crisp digital cinematography that borders on antiseptic, especially with the static, sometimes oddly placed camera angles. But when a friend of the family is accidentally kidnapped in place of David’s son and he reluctantly agrees to pay the ransom, the film’s visual strategy shifts. As David boards a subway in Brooklyn to drop the money somewhere in the Bronx, Lee switches to 16mm celluloid, capturing the less controlled, more vibrant energy of a crowded 6 train making its way through multiple boroughs – on a Yankees game day coinciding with the Puerto Rican Day parade, no less. David’s cloistered version of New York falls away. It’s a good long while before any traditional thriller action kicks in, yet in this transition, the movie vibrates, subway-like, with excitement, like it’s about to break into song. Forty years into his career, Lee keeps finding new ways to show his love for the city, and the movies. The Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi made It Was Just an Accident in secret, his usual MO to resist censorship from an Iranian regime that recently sentenced him (in absentia) to yet another year in prison. That clandestine approach made way for one of the movie’s most surprising (and in part, accidentally) subversive moments, during an overhead shot where the film-making team is recording and directing from a rooftop. In Panahi’s soul-searching tragicomic allegory about how Iran’s people will find a way forward from oppression and trauma, the occupants in a stalled white van, a bride in a full white gown among them, hop out into Tehran’s traffic to push the vehicle along. They’re in a panic because these former political prisoners have got an abducted man, who they believe to be their torturer, knocked out and tied down in the back. The moment arrives as a joyous bit of comic relief from the urgency of the narrative. But it grows even more transcendent when passersby, at least one who isn’t an actor according to the film’s cinematographer, come along to help the stranded passengers. It’s one of the many fissures between fiction and reality in It Was Just an Accident, a potent and unassuming image of hope and community, where the people of Iran have a hand in the film’s political resistance, whether they know it or not. Perhaps the most arrestingly mysterious establishing scene of the year was in Rungano Nyoni’s On Becoming a Guinea Fowl, a drama of memory and reconciliation set in present-day Zambia. The film opens on Susan Chardy’s city-dwelling Shula, driving alone at night on a dark rural road. She is clad in a glittery mask as if having just come from a masquerade ball, a jaunty classic tune (Come on Home by the Lijadu Sisters) brightly blaring on the radio. Her pleasant, if strange, journey is then suddenly darkened by the discovery of a body lying on the road. What follows in Nyoni’s transfixing film is grim and haunting and fitfully funny. That mood is cast perfectly right from the get-go, as dreamy surreality runs into cold, hard fact. At first, David Osit’s documentary reflects on the unsavory legacy of To Catch a Predator, the popular mid-2000s Dateline NBC show in which would-be pedophiles were lured to a home packed with hidden cameras and exposed for trying to hook up with underage kids. But the show is merely a jumping-off point for a more prismatic look at a culture of abuse and exploitation, and it leads to a particularly mesmerizing segment on the YouTube copycats who have brought the same TV formula into the digital era. In one sequence, Osit’s camera is present for a chaotic sting operation in a seedy motel where Skeet Hansen, a popular host, emerges from a closet to snare a man who thinks he’s meeting a 14-year-old girl. The man is so profoundly distraught over his choices that it deflates Hansen’s “gotcha” moment. Yet Hansen has a brand to protect, which leads to the most comically sober utterance of his catchphrase imaginable: “You’ve just been Skeeted.”",Andrew Lawrence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/05/guardian-charity-appeal-2025-communities-hope,"Communities are our defence against hatred. Now, more than ever, we must invest in hope",2025-12-05T12:07:53.000Z,"For this year’s Guardian charity appeal we are asking readers to donate to Citizens UK, The Linking Network, Locality, Hope Unlimited Charitable Trust and Who is Your Neighbour? t has been an unsettling year of social division, anger and unrest in the UK and beyond. Extremist violence and rhetoric are escalating, with the demonisation of migrants reaching a fever pitch. Far-right activists Against this toxic backdrop, the Guardian is launching its 2025 charity appeal on Friday. This year’s theme, unapologetically, is hope. We are supporting grassroots charities, which, through their vital work at the heart of local neighbourhoods, nurture community pride and positive change, and provide a powerful antidote to polarisation, distrust and hate. Our partner charities – and the projects they support – are united in the belief that however loud the forces of hate and division, they will never drown out the values shared by the vast majority: tolerance, compassion and common humanity. Many local communities face huge challenges, as public services, communal spaces and civic infrastructure have been eroded. Rising inequality, driven by austerity and our broken economic model, has led to resentment. For too many, poverty is deep-rooted. For others, dreams of a better future – for themselves and their children – have been dashed. Trust in politicians and institutions is fragile. The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, enabled by social media and the rightwing press, has distorted and soured debate. Intimidation, harassment and violence against minorities and those who support them have grown. It can feel frightening, and bleak. The Guardian is committed to reporting on fresh ideas, not only critiquing the state of the world, because we believe that the way things are isn’t the way they need to be. And the work of our partner charities offer examples of practical and inspiring options. These charities, which operate in some of the UK’s most economically deprived areas, campaign for better housing, improved health services and thriving high streets. They help restore abandoned libraries, parks and community centres. They run food banks, jobs and skills initiatives, youth and sports clubs, drop-in centres, arts projects, neighbourhood festivals and refugee welcome initiatives. They help to build hope. Their achievements are grounded in the way they approach their work. It is locally led and focused. It is built around respectful, empathetic and honest conversations about what matters to people. It brings together neighbours and cultures and faiths to find common values and drive positive change. They make connections and build relationships, hope and resilience. They offer a true antidote to division and despair, and focus on what unites rather than what divides us. As Locality, one of our charity appeal partners, puts it: “Our communities are the beating heart of a fairer society and a defence against hatred – places where everyone should feel safe, valued, and that they belong. Now, more than ever, we must invest in hope, and in the people who make it real, day after day, on the ground.” Charity alone can never make up for the divisions in our society, the extreme inequality, our damaged public services and years of austerity. But the Guardian appeal showcases what is possible. It is a tribute to those whose voluntary efforts transform individual lives and communities, in the public interest, and a celebration of social justice. Your donations will make a real difference. Donations will be shared between our five appeal partners: Each champions practical initiatives to change their communities for the better. Over the next few weeks, we will highlight our partner charities’ work. Our charity appeal telethon takes place on Saturday 13 December, when our great journalists will take your calls and donations. The will donate 20p from every order received until 31 December to the appeal. Over the past decade, Guardian readers have raised an incredible £15m for good causes through our annual appeal. Themes have included refugees and asylum seekers, child poverty, the climate crisis, the Windrush scandal, and support for victims of war and conflict. Your generosity has been very moving. We hope we can inspire you to donate once again.",Katharine Viner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/22/bosses-at-city-and-guilds-handed-million-pound-bonuses-after-training-firm-is-privatised,Bosses at City & Guilds handed million-pound bonuses after training firm is privatised,2025-12-22T11:31:27.000Z,"Exclusive: Executives at body that trained chef Jamie Oliver awarded pay rises and bonuses after sale to private firm – as hundreds of jobs may be offshored A pair of City & Guilds executives have each been awarded million-pound bonuses and sizeable salary increases after the skills charity’s business was acquired by an international company in October, the Guardian understands. The payments – which are understood to include a £1.7m award for the chief executive, Kirstie Donnelly, and £1.2m to the finance director, Abid Ismail – have emerged at a sensitive time for the training and qualifications business, as it navigates its first few months in the private sector. Last week it was revealed how City & Guilds has embarked on a after being sold by its charity owner to PeopleCert, an international certification company. Alongside the bonuses, the Guardian understands that Donnelly has also been granted a £100,000 increase to her salary, which now stands at about £430,000. Ismail’s salary is also believed to have been increased by 30%, rising by about £70,000 to £300,000. Founded in 1878 by the City of London and a group of 16 livery companies, the original institute developed a national system of technical education, offering in fields ranging from manufacturing and mechanical engineering to hairdressing and horticulture. It was awarded a royal charter by Queen Victoria in 1900 and the body says that it helps about 1.1m people a year. It has enjoyed a storied history with the body’s famous alumni including the chefs , the former England football manager Gareth Southgate, as well as the celebrity gardener The institute’s business was owned under the umbrella of a charity, City & Guilds London Institute (CGLI), which announced in the autumn that it was selling its training and awards operation, City & Guilds (C&G), The sale gave the charity, which , a cash windfall of between £180m and £200m, which was presented as ensuring the long-term future of the institution to pursue its charitable objectives, as well as providing increased opportunities and investment for the now-private training business. These ambitions appear to coincide with plans for a restructuring of the C&G training business. Earlier this month PeopleCert published a presentation aimed at its financial backers in which it said it had identified £22m of savings at C&G, of which £13m were “personnel cost synergies” that would largely be achieved by failing to replace staff leaving the institute with hires from the UK. The document implied that C&G, which has more than and 1,800 “associates” on short-term contracts, has a “churn” rate equivalent to about 300 people leaving a year and outlined how PeopleCert plans to relocate a third of those jobs to “at a cost [of] up to 50% lower”. The same quantity of roles “are due to not be replaced due to overlapping functions”, the presentation added, while the remainder of leavers will be replaced with hires in the UK. The presentation appears to have been removed from the PeopleCert website after the Guardian published the cost-cutting plans. Under the terms of the sale, the privatised City & Guilds will continue to use the brand that it shares with its former charity owner. A spokesperson for City & Guilds said: “[The charity] CGLI will be publishing its accounts in January 2026 and details on pay and remuneration will be reported appropriately in those accounts as always. Bonuses for eligible employees reflecting performance in 2025 are payable in line with CGLI remuneration policy. No payments outside of CGLI’s existing bonus schemes have been made. The CGLI annual accounts will report on the long-term future that is now protected for the charity. At the same time, this transaction unlocks future investment for the commercial awarding and training businesses that continue to operate in a highly competitive marketplace. “The accounts for City & Guilds Ltd will be published at year end in 2026, as required for private limited companies. Any awards to employees are a matter for City & Guilds Ltd and are guided by standard commercial practice to ensure critical expertise and experience is retained.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/03/scott-galloway-masculinity-crisis-notes-on-being-a-man,"Scott Galloway on the masculinity crisis: ‘I worry we are evolving a new breed of asexual, asocial males’",2025-12-03T05:00:52.000Z,"When his book Notes on Being a Man was released last month, it raced to the top of the bestseller lists. The US author, tech entrepreneur and podcaster explains his theories on dating, crying – and the rise of Donald Trump t takes balls to title your book Notes on Being a Man. And, superficially, Scott Galloway could easily be lumped in with a dozen other manosphere-friendly alpha-bros promising to teach young men how to find their inner wolf. He is, after all, a wealthy, healthy, white, heterosexual, shaven-headed, 61-year-old Californian who made his name and fortune as a successful investor and podcaster. But in reality, he is almost the opposite: liberal, left-leaning and surprisingly sensitive. The guy who advises his readers on “how to address the masculinity crisis, build mental strength and raise good sons” has been described as a “progressive Jordan Peterson”, or “ Galloway is also sufficiently self-aware not to claim he has all the answers. “I don’t think it would be well received for me to say, ‘This is how you become a man,’” he says, speaking from his London home. “What I’m trying to say is, this is where I’ve had some success, and mostly where I screwed up trying to become a man.” He moved to the UK from Florida three years ago, partly because he and his wife thought it was a better place to raise their two sons, who are now 15 and 18. “Great culture, interesting people, the proximity of the continent is amazing, and the Premier League is just fantastic – there’s nothing like it.” Also: “If you’re talking about assault rifles or bodily autonomy, it’s not even a discussion here.” He still finds the weather challenging, though. There’s a studio in the basement where Galloway records his : Prof G Pod (business and life wisdom – and he really is a professor, of marketing, at New York University); Raging Moderates (with the liberal Fox News host Jessica Tarlov); and most popular of all, . The two of them are good company, comparing their jetset lifestyles, commenting on tech, politics and current affairs, their easy banter peppered with Galloway’s wilfully crude jokes. “We can rib each other,” he says, “because that’s a form of equality and affection.” When Galloway first started talking about masculinity, he says, people weren’t prepared to listen. “It was like, here’s more misogyny, here’s more men blaming women – the gag reflex was so strong.” This was about four years ago, but all that has now changed. When Notes On Being a Man was released in early November, it raced to the top of the New York Times advice books bestseller list and Galloway has been in demand in the media ever since, giving his take on what’s wrong with men, and what to do about it. Galloway has plenty of statistics to back up his claim that young men really in trouble. Drawing on research by writers such as (author of 2022’s Of Boys and Men) and his NYU colleague (whose recent book The Anxious Generation sounded the alarm on social media), he sketches out a landscape of rising rates of everything from boys’ school suspensions to male unemployment, addictions, loneliness, and failure to complete college. “We’re going to graduate probably two women for every one man from college in the next five years, because men drop out at a greater rate.” Galloway suggests that the previous denial of the problem, especially by the political left, might even have put Donald Trump back in the White House. “Let me offer that the reason we elected [him] is because of struggling with men.” Two groups that pivoted hardest towards Trump in 2024, he says, were young men, and women aged 45 to 64, and “my thesis is that’s the mothers of young men.” While Trump embraced the manosphere, the Democrats championed the interests of virtually every special interest group In his book, Galloway’s solutions to men’s problems often boil down to a set of pithy codes and maxims, some of which feel like sound common sense, while others might feel rather old-fashioned. One of his oft-repeated tenets, for example, is that “men protect, provide, and procreate”. You could easily say the same of women. Also, Galloway tends to see the “protect” element in the context of men using their physical strength for good – “real men don’t start bar fights; they break them up” – even if a lot of the time, the thing people need protection , especially women, is other men. And the “provide” element he couches largely in economic terms. “I tell my sons, when you’re in the company of women, you pay for everything. And if you can’t, you don’t go out … A woman is not going to have sex with a man who splits the bill with her.” Signalling resource is one of the three things women find most attractive, according to another of his maxims, along with kindness and intellect. He admits his sons tell him this is a boomer view of modern dating, but “I try to go where the data takes me,” he says. “Research shows that society, and men themselves, are really hard on men when they’re not economically viable.” And if men aren’t economically viable, that’s when the problems start, he contends. “They’re just going to have an absence of mating opportunities. And when men don’t have a romantic relationship, they tend to kind of come off the tracks.” He cites statistics that women fare much better without men than vice versa. “Men have a difficult time maintaining friendships without a romantic partner. They tend to reallocate that energy into conspiracy theory, going extremely online, porn – and they never develop the skills to establish a romantic relationship.” Galloway has been highly vocal about the tech industry and social media’s role in compounding these problems, by giving men easy dopamine hits and fewer reasons to ever leave their bedrooms. As he puts it, “I worry we are literally evolving a new breed of asexual, asocial male.” Galloway’s analysis can become somewhat Darwinian and reductive – a little bit, “men are this and women are this”, as if there’s a one-size-fits-all set of solutions to these problems – coloured by nostalgia for a bygone patriarchal order. Nuances of race or sexuality are barely addressed, as Galloway readily admits: “People say, well, what’s the masculinity code for gay men? And the honest answer is, I have no fucking idea. I’m not even gonna take a swing at it.” But isn’t it also a bit … Jordan Peterson? Peterson proposed his own cure for “the masculinity crisis” in his bestselling – rule number one was “stand up straight with your shoulders back”. And we’ve had plenty of masculine self-help books in this mould since. Galloway has a surprising respect for Peterson, not least for broaching this subject before it became fashionable. “Where we differ is that I find that Jordan basically uses his incredible skills of communication and knowledge of psychology to always reverse-engineer into an incredibly conservative viewpoint that sometimes, in my view, takes women’s rights away. That it basically goes back to this notion of ‘women are happiest when they’re in a supporting role to men’. I just don’t think that’s accurate.” Galloway is at pains to point out that he’s not blaming women for men’s problems. “I do not think the answer is to in any way economically disadvantage women,” he says. “I’m not trying to repackage violence here and say that women need to lower their standards such that we don’t have a bunch of angry men out there. I think men need to level up. And I think, as a society, we need to implement more programmes to level up all young people.” Given all this, you wonder why he chose to focus just on men. Beyond his book – in his , for example – Galloway has persuasively argued that the real problems facing of society, especially in the US, are the transfer of wealth and power from the young to the old, and the commercialisation of politics, healthcare and higher education. When it comes down to it, he says, “this is a battle between liberal and illiberal, it’s not a battle between men and women. The genders have done a great job convincing themselves it’s the other gender’s fault. I just don’t think that’s productive.” Where Peterson and his ilk seek to trace men’s problems back to the erosion of conservative values, Galloway does some reverse-engineering of his own: back to a place of economic, romantic and especially family security. If there’s a moment “when a boy comes off the tracks and develops problems later in life”, he says, “it’s the moment he loses a male role model through death, divorce or abandonment”. The thesis is more personal than his data-driven approach suggests. Galloway’s own father and mother emigrated from Scotland and England, respectively, and settled in California in the 1960s, but their American Dream did not last. When Galloway was nine, his father walked out and moved in with another woman, leaving his impoverished mother to bring him up alone. Not exactly a role model, then, but father, Galloway’s grandfather, was even worse, he says – an angry alcoholic. “When my dad was a very young boy, his father used to come home and wake him and beat him.” It’s a low bar, Galloway admits, but at least his own father was an improvement. Their relationship taught him a lot, he says. One of his biggest breakthroughs was when he realised that he kept a score card around relationships, starting with his dad. Like, “Why am I being such a good son when he wasn’t that good a father?” He says he became much happier when he put the score card away and just focused on being the son wanted to be – and the husband, partner, friend, co-worker he wanted to be, on his own terms. It’s made him happier and his relationships better, he says. His father died earlier this year. “My dad softened as he got older, and we had a wonderful relationship the last 20, 30 years of his life.” When Galloway tells his origin story, he does not paint himself as an exceptional talent. He was unremarkable academically and physically, better at scoring weed than picking up women, it seems. He puts his success as much down to luck and structural advantages: good schooling in a prosperous state in a prosperous country, not being subject to racial or gender discrimination, a loving mother, scraping into a good university (the University of California, Los Angeles). “The truth is, I was born on third base.” But having grown up relatively poor, economic security was always his motivation. “I took a very much like, ‘How do you win capitalism?’ approach.” He was also fortunate to hit his stride as an entrepreneur just as the dotcom boom was beginning, and founded some successful (and some unsuccessful) companies in emerging fields such as e-commerce and digital market research. In 2017 he sold his business intelligence firm L2 for $155m (he estimates his own net worth at about $150m (£117m)). Now Galloway divides his time equally between writing, investing and media, including his podcasting network. He is happy in London, but is planning to return to the US next year “to make America America again”. In preparation for the 2026 and ’28 elections, he wants to help build an informal, Democrat-friendly podcast network, and is already working with several Democratic candidates. “People hear all these celebrities talking about how they’re going to leave America. I actually think, when your country isn’t doing well, that’s when you’re supposed to go home.” Whether or not a crisis among men led to the current regime, the men now in power are definitely not the manly paragons Galloway has in mind. “I would argue that what Trump and guys like Elon Musk are doing could not be more ,” he says. “They have conflated, or tried to conflate, masculinity with coarseness and cruelty. And it’s not only incorrect, it’s a terrible role model for young men.” Who are Galloway’s role models? The first two he offers are Muhammad Ali and, more surprisingly, Margaret Thatcher. “I don’t know if it’s fair to call her masculine, but I think that kind of strength …” He’s also an admirer of Keanu Reeves, who “gives a lot of his exceptional compensation to other actors, is super kind, donates time, very humble”. Is Galloway a good role model? He’s not so sure. “People say, ‘Oh, your kids are so lucky to have you,’ and I get self conscious because there are so many weekends where I’m so wrapped up in my own shit and not spending enough time or attention with my kids. I’m not present enough. So I have huge impostor syndrome around this.” For all his life lessons, Galloway is not afraid to admit his own fallibility and vulnerability. When his father died earlier this year, for example, he spoke movingly about it and wept on his Pivot show. Crying is good for men, he argues. “For the last 3,000 years, we’ve been taught if you demonstrate weakness – and a way to demonstrate weakness is crying – that some other dude might take your shit, fuck your wife and eat your children. And so men have been taught to not express that weakness. And the good news is, we live in a modern society where people are not going to kill you because you cry, and it just feels really good.” He didn’t cry between the ages of 29 and 44, he says. Now “I don’t have anything that [holds] me back from crying. And it’s not an attempt to demonstrate my femininity, it’s just an attempt to slow time down.” Despite his rigorous fitness regime, his access to luxury experiences and cutting-edge healthcare (including regular testosterone injections), and his embrace of a certain amount of hedonism (he likes his cannabis edibles, he happily declares), Galloway is starting to feel his age. “When you hit about your late 50s, years turn into seasons, seasons turn into months, months into weeks, and it’s like, ‘Fucking A, the end is barrelling towards us.’ And one of the tricks I found for slowing it down is if you find something that inspires you and really moves you, stop and feel it, and touch it. I walked in Regent’s Park yesterday, and there’s this rose garden there I’d never seen. I’m not into roses, but I just thought, God, this is so cool. So I just stopped and thought, why do I find this interesting? Who does this? Why do they do it?” He gets emotional every other day now, he says, “in the context of watching Modern Family, or reading something that moves me, or hearing a friend talk about the struggles with their kids. And I’ve generally found that it informs your own emotions, it makes you feel closer to people, and that, for the most part, people are really receptive to it.” Especially other men. Rather than wanting to take his shit away, he says, “they’re like, Jesus, can I have some of that?” Maybe this openness to emotion is what really sets Galloway apart from his testosterone-fuelled peers. You can model the alpha-male lifestyle and dispense codes and maxims, but it still takes balls to admit it’s good for guys to cry.",Steve Rose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/12/fertility-clinic-doctors-stole-womans-eggs-to-get-another-pregnant,Rogue doctors stole one woman’s eggs to get another patient pregnant. What happened next is an unlikely tale of friendship against the odds,2025-04-12T11:00:45.000Z,"When it emerged that a fertility clinic had made one woman pregnant with another’s baby, Renée Ballou and Carole LieberWilkins were advised to ‘lawyer up’. Instead they did something extraordinary – even as one raised the other’s biological child enée Ballou thought she was a lucky person. In the 1980s, she was living in a beautiful home an hour’s drive from Los Angeles, with a job she loved, a happy marriage and a young son. Everything had always felt so easy for Renée – until she began trying for a second child. Two years on, she still wasn’t pregnant. “I was pretty much used to getting what I wanted,” Renée, now 67, tells me with a sad smile. “It was very stressful.” Along with her husband, Wesley, Renée went through a battery of tests, followed by years of surgeries, supplements and hormones. Her gynaecologist referred them to Dr Sergio Stone, a fertility specialist at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in Orange County, for more treatment. They tried artificial insemination – first with Wesley’s sperm, then with a donor – without success. Their son, Matthew, was four when they started trying for a sibling for him; by 1987 he was 10. It was lonely and emotionally and physically gruelling. But Renée refused to give up. “I wanted that baby more than anything.” Then, Renée seemed to get lucky again. Stone told her that two high-flying South American fertility doctors – Argentine Ricardo Asch and José Balmaceda, a Chilean – had been recently recruited from Texas to work with him at UCI. “They had this miracle programme. They’d had a huge success rate over in San Antonio,” she remembers being told. Asch had developed a groundbreaking new technique called gamete intrafallopian transfer – snappily abbreviated to Gift – where eggs were fertilised inside the fallopian tubes. It was more invasive than IVF (where sperm and egg are made to meet outside the human body) but it appeared to be up to twice as successful, according to research led by Asch, in 1984. Renée felt incredibly fortunate to have this pioneer arrive on her doorstep. in 1978, there was a gold rush in private fertility medicine in the US. In California, doctors who promised new techniques with better success rates were able to earn fortunes. Asch was flashy – he owned five racehorses and several beachside mansions, and drove a red Ferrari with the numberplate DR GIFT – and entrepreneurial. He travelled to the Vatican to secure the , successfully making the case that his procedure should be more acceptable for the world’s billion Catholics than IVF, because Gift babies were conceived inside the body. Asch’s waiting room at the Garden Grove Medical Centre was bright, and packed. Renée was impressed. “It wasn’t like you were sitting next to people from Orange County – everybody was flying in from somewhere different,” she remembers. Bills of $10,000 a cycle were not unusual. . (Renée’s costs were covered by the carpet franchise company where she worked.) She was only 30 in 1987; Asch told her she was a great candidate for Gift, that she would easily get pregnant. “I just felt so that he was spending this time with me,” she says. She liked him. “He had a fun side. Which was good, because it’s not a fun process.” Gift demanded weeks of blood tests, transvaginal ultrasounds and carefully timed daily injections of drugs to stimulate Renée’s ovulation, followed by surgery under general anaesthetic. While Renée was unconscious, Asch harvested 22 eggs from her ovaries, selected four, and placed them into her fallopian tubes along with donor sperm. When Renée woke up after the procedure, Asch said it had all gone brilliantly. “You’re pregnant,” he told her. But she didn’t feel it. “From the minute I got home, I had an intuition: I just I was not pregnant.” The feeling was confirmed by a negative test a few days later. Back in Asch’s office, he was still so optimistic: Renée was such a good candidate for Gift, he said, they should try again. But a feeling of cold resignation came over her. “I just looked at him and said, ‘No. I’m .’” The most cutting-edge treatment available hadn’t made her pregnant. “If the best didn’t work, why continue? My marriage was deteriorating. At some point, you’ve got to stop.” Renée and Wesley resolved to move on with their lives. Renée was offered a high-flying job in Sacramento, so the family moved to northern California. Matthew started at a new school; Renée threw herself into her work. But her marriage never recovered. Renée and Wesley divorced in 1992. Three years later, Renée’s mother died, and Renée decided to move back to southern California to be closer to her friends and family. In October 1995, she was loading the last of her possessions from her Sacramento home into a removals van, when her landline rang. It was a reporter from the Orange County Register. “Are you alone?” the reporter asked. “No,” Renée said. Her brother and new partner were helping with the move. The reporter said Renée should fetch one of them, and find somewhere to sit down. Then she told Renée that the Register was about to publish a story about Asch and Balmaceda, and her name had come up in connection with it. They had got hold of Renée’s medical records and seen that, while she had been unconscious on Asch’s operating table, he had stolen some of her eggs and given them to another patient without Renée’s knowledge or consent. That woman – a stranger – had gone on to become pregnant and give birth to a son. The baby that Renée had spent six years trying to conceive. The baby she so desperately wanted. he UCI fertility scandal, as it came to be known, was relatively old news by the time Renée received that phone call. The Orange County Register had been reporting on it for five months, since whistleblowers from Asch and Balmaceda’s clinic first gave journalists photocopied records in May 1995 that revealed eggs were being harvested without patients’ consent. It took years for the full scale of the scandal to emerge, but subsequent investigations by reporters and the authorities at UCI ultimately indicated that at least had their eggs or embryos stolen by Asch and Balmaceda, leading to It was an explosive story. Former patients, now victims, gave interviews to Oprah Winfrey, Phil Donahue and Maria Shriver. Some to try to track down the children conceived with their stolen eggs. Loretta and Basilio Jorge, who learned that a woman had given birth to twins believed to be conceived with Loretta’s eggs, made . The scandal was quickly turned into a Renée had already heard about it. Her mother had spotted a People magazine story about the Jorges’ custody battle and, shortly before she died, pointed it out to Renée. “My mom said, ‘Look at this! That’s your doctor!’ I read it. I said, ‘I believe it. My doctors would have never done anything like that to .’ I thought of them as gods. I had them on a pedestal.” She dismissed it as an absurd tabloid story. “I thought it was ridiculous.” Her eyes are still wide in disbelief, 30 years after taking the phone call in her empty Sacramento home. We are talking in Matthew’s kitchen in Anaheim, Orange County, less than 15 minutes away from where the Garden Grove clinic used to be. Renée speaks slowly and deliberately, as if she is still trying to process it all. When she hung up the phone to the reporter, she told her brother and her boyfriend what she’d just learned. “They thought that was the news, that I had this child. I said, ‘Are you effing kidding me? This is Her mind went back to the forms she had signed in 1987 and how she had explicitly stated that she did not want to donate any of her eggs. “It’s your genetic material. It’s being a mother. Absolutely not.” The reporter faxed her the medical form from UCI the next morning. Renée was named as a “donor”; four of her eggs had been given to another woman whose name had been redacted, and the procedure had resulted in a live birth (marked male). “Then I thought, what if there’s that I don’t know about? If there were 22 eggs, she got four and I got four – what if I have more children?” (The subsequent investigation by UCI, which , concluded that the baby boy was likely to be the only live birth from Renée’s eggs – but no one can be sure.) Stealing eggs, or using them without permission, was not illegal when Asch and Balmaceda were doing it. They were ultimately charged with fraud and tax evasion, but they the US for Mexico and Chile, respectively, in 1995, before they could face justice. The law was changed in the wake of the scandal, and the use of embryos and eggs without consent has been a The news cycle moved on, but Renée could not. The baby conceived with her stolen egg was seven by the time she found out he existed in 1995. Where was he? And what was she going to do about him? arole LieberWilkins, 71, is a marriage and family therapist who works with people using donor conception or surrogacy to create their families. She is one of the first practitioners in the world to specialise in this area – and she came to it for personal reasons. “I was licensed as a therapist in January of 1984, opened up my office as a general therapist, and seven months later I was diagnosed,” she tells me. Aged only 30, she learned she was going through menopause. “There’s no cure for menopause. If you want to be parents, you’ll have to adopt,” said the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) reproductive endocrinologist who diagnosed her, with a bluntness that still startles Carole as she recalls it 40 years later. “The diagnosis itself was devastating,” she says. Carole had been married to Don, an architect, for five years. “I had really thought about us having a baby together by that time, even though we weren’t trying.” Don had been ambivalent about becoming a father, but the news galvanised Carole. “The quest to become parents started the day I was diagnosed.” At the sun-drenched kitchen table of the airy Malibu home she shares with her second husband, Jay, Carole gives the impression of someone who makes things happen. But when it came to fertility treatment, there were no options for women like her in 1984. Two years later, the tactless endocrinologist referred her and Don to an experimental programme at UCLA called “ovum transfer”. It was an early form of egg donation: a donor would be artificially inseminated, with her egg fertilised inside her uterus, but it would be washed out before it had a chance to implant in the lining of her womb, and transferred to the intended mother. Carole met an adoption lawyer in 1986, in the hope that she and Don might have a child placed with them by early 1987. But being pregnant mattered to her. “I wanted to be a member of a club, and I felt really excluded from that club.” What club? “Women who have given birth. Mommies.” So she signed up for ovum transfer. She got as far as meeting the woman who had agreed to donate her egg to her and Don; she insisted on it, much to the bewilderment of her doctors at a time when anonymous sperm donation was standard practice. But the ovum transfer programme closed down before they got to participate in it, in large part because the procedure left many of the egg donors accidentally pregnant. Instead, Carole and Don were referred to have a different cutting-edge fertility treatment: the Gift programme at UCI. “We had an initial consultation with Asch, who said, ‘You’re a perfect candidate, and there’s a six- to 18-month wait.’” The donors, Carole was told, were women undergoing who agreed to give away eggs they couldn’t use; it wasn’t possible to freeze or preserve them in those days, so it made sense to her that a few women might be willing to donate eggs rather than see them perish. But there were far more people seeking eggs than donating them, she was told. So they continued to pursue adoption, figuring that they would use Gift to try for their second child. Carole’s adopted son, Alex, was born in May 1987. It was an open adoption, which meant that Carole was in close contact with his biological mother, who came to their home and met their extended family. This was pretty radical at the time. “It seemed scary to everybody but us,” Carole smiles. Exactly a month after Alex’s birth, she got a call from Asch’s office: they had a donor, the woman was having her eggs retrieved at that very moment, and Carole needed to get to the clinic in two hours for her Gift procedure. Carole lived a two-hour drive away, and had a newborn baby in her arms. “I called my mother. I left Alex with her, and we got in the car and drove to Garden Grove.” She retrieves a scrap of paper from a box file: it’s the note from June 1987 where she had jotted down, in curly cursive writing, what Asch’s office told her on the phone about the donor. “29 y.o. 5’9”. 135[lbs]. Blonde. Medium [build]. Caucasian. Endometriosis. [Works in] Marketing.” Finding out these details mattered to her, even though she had no time to waste getting to the clinic. She kept asking questions when she arrived. “They said, ‘What do you need to know all that for? This is going to be child. Once they put that baby in your arms, you’ll never think about it again.’” Did she ask whether the donor had consented? “It never occurred to me to ask that question,” she tells me, quietly. “I’d like to tell you that it did, but it didn’t.” Two weeks after Asch inserted four eggs into Carole’s fallopian tubes along with Don’s sperm, Carole had a positive pregnancy test. “It was unreal. I just remember walking around saying, ‘Menopausal women don’t get pregnant.’” When did she start to believe it? “When Daniel came out.” Daniel was born in March 1988. He was an easy baby, Carole says, very sweet, and very blond – in contrast to her own dark features. She has since learned that he is among the first 11 people in the world to have been conceived through egg donation (the first was in Australia, in 1983). But she never felt like a pioneer. She was too busy looking after two sons who were only 10 months apart. “I remember being blissfully happy.” From the outset, Carole was honest with both her sons about how she came to be their mother. At a time when doctors actively discouraged parents from telling their children they were donor conceived, this was groundbreaking. But it came naturally. “I had adoption books at home for very young children. I have a vivid memory of sitting with one on each side of me. I was reading this book and referencing Alex’s story, and I remember spontaneously turning to Daniel and saying, ‘And you were sort of, kind of, adopted.’ It really was like a 50% adoption to me, and so it just didn’t make any sense not to do that when I was doing it with Alex.” As Carole started to specialise in therapy for donor conception and surrogacy, she and Asch became colleagues. They went to the same conferences; they bumped into each other at lectures and meetings. She would update him on how the son he helped her give birth to was doing. She even brought Daniel along to a conference in Palm Springs, and he got to meet Asch in person. Then, at a conference in 1994, Asch took Carole to one side. “He said, ‘The UC Regents are out to get me. You’re going to hear some things about me that are completely untrue. I just want you to know.’ I said, ‘That’s I’m so sorry.’” She looks me dead in the eye. “The next year was when I got the call from the Orange County Register.” t would be years before Renée learned Carole’s last name, the name Carole shared with the boy conceived from Renée’s stolen egg. But she didn’t think much about Carole, at first. Instead, she was bothered by the idea that Wesley may have made small talk in the Garden Grove waiting room with whoever-she-was’s husband, a man who would soon be celebrating his wife’s pregnancy, while Renée and Wesley’s marriage disintegrated. Wesley was horrified by the news. “He felt like I had been wronged, and he had, too,” she says. It was his idea to contact , one of the most famous and notoriously hard-nosed lawyers in the US, who took them on as clients. As her stolen egg had resulted in a live birth, Renée’s claim against UCI was particularly strong, but the theft was classed as medical malpractice, which limited the amount of compensation she could claim. “Malpractice, to me, is when you cut the wrong kidney out – not when you steal eggs and give them to other people,” she says, bitterly. Renée got $250,000 from UCI – the maximum she could have been entitled to – and an apology. Allred told Renée she could go further: she could seek custody, or at least visitation rights, over her biological son. “She said, ‘You don’t have to enforce it, but have it, in case you ever need it. What if they pack him up and take him out of the country?’ If they were crazy people, I would have no recourse without it.” The Orange County Register reporter offered to connect Renée and Carole. The women spoke on the phone, along with Daniel’s father, Don, a few months after they found out what Asch had done. “They were very cautious, very defensive,” Renée says. “She had some questions. What was I wanting?” “I was really scared,” Carole says. “Being a nongenetic parent, having gone through infertility, there’s this feeling of, am I entitled to this child? I absolutely thought it was possible that she’d try to get him.” Carole had everything to lose. She had established herself as an expert therapist in the field of donor conception: what would happen to her career if it emerged that her own child had been conceived from a stolen egg? She knew other victims had hired private investigators to track down their biological children. “We thought reporters would be standing outside our house trying to take a picture of Daniel. We were worried about his safety and security. I remember Don saying something like, ‘She can’t get Daniel, but she can ruin our lives trying.’” Allred repeatedly told Renée that she could seek custody or visitation rights. But it was never an option for her, Renée tells me. “If he had been younger – one or two or three, maybe, or even four – I probably would have sought some visitation. But he was .” She shakes her head. “I could never do that to him. Or to them. You know, they were victims, too.” Slowly – tentatively – Renée and Carole began to forge a relationship. At first, they exchanged letters, with Carole’s adoption lawyer acting as their intermediary, because Carole was wary of letting Renée know her home address. Carole wanted to know about Renée’s medical history; Renée wanted to know what Daniel was like. “He was playing soccer, he was doing well at school. Normal things,” Renée says. She sent photos of herself and Matthew for Carole to show to Daniel, and Carole sent her photos of Daniel. “I’d be so excited when I saw the mail and got the pictures. But it was heartbreaking to see him. I would cry, because I’d see a lot of Matthew in him.” Renée told Carole about her struggle with alcoholism. She has been sober since 2004, but tells me that, at her worst, she was drinking three bottles of wine a night, alone. Carole agreed to test Daniel’s DNA. “My brother said, ‘She’s going to swab the dog’s mouth,’” Renée says. “And I said, ‘No, she’s not.’ I trusted her, and she trusted me. People don’t send you pictures and answer your letters and then become a liar. Everything she said she was going to do, she did, and everything I said I was going to do, I did.” The DNA results confirmed Daniel was Renée’s son. When Daniel was eight, Renée and Carole were speaking on the phone and, out of the blue, Carole asked Renée if she’d like to talk to him. (Carole tells me she thought nothing of this – she used to pass the phone over to Alex so that he could chat to his biological mother. Why not do the same with Daniel?) “I got on the phone and I said, ‘Hi Daniel. How are you?’” Renée says. They chatted about football, school, friends – the kind of conversation any adult would make with an eight-year-old boy. “I kept him on the phone for a few minutes. When I got off, I just . But I was so happy that she let me have that conversation with him. For all she knew, I could have just gone crazy and said, ‘I’m your mommy.’ She totally trusted me.” Renée shakes her head in disbelief. Against the odds, in a country where contracts and threats of litigation define every complex relationship, Renée and Carole chose to have faith in each other’s goodness. Renée never tried to track Daniel down; Carole never withheld Daniel from Renée. When Carole first learned what had happened at Asch’s clinic, she sought advice from a high-powered attorney. “He said, ‘Lawyer up, baby. Lawyer up,’ she tells me, fixing me with her eyes. “I don’t know why, but I then called a different attorney, a female attorney. And she said, ‘What does Renée want? Talk to her.’ It changed my life.” Renée wanted Daniel to know who she was, and that she would like to meet him once he was ready. Nothing more. “The amount of restraint on Renée’s part is really extraordinary.” They continued to exchange letters and occasional phone calls. Eventually, Carole ditched the intermediary and let Renée know her full name and address. Carole and Don got divorced; both she and Renée remarried, and Renée invited Daniel to her wedding. “He was 13 or 14,” Carole says, “I told him about it – it was a few years after Jay and I got married – and he said, ‘I didn’t want to go to wedding. Why would I want to go to Several years into their relationship, Carole was due to go to a conference near where Renée was living, and she suggested they meet in person for the first time, in a restaurant. “We chat, we’re both very nervous,” Carole remembers. “And then Renée says, ‘Put out your hand. I have something for you.’ So I put out my hand.” Carole reaches down for her purse and takes something from it, which she drops into my hand, just as Renée once placed it into hers. “Renée says, ‘This is my nine-year AA chip. I never would have made it without you.’” She takes it back from me, quickly. “I carry it with me. It’s extremely meaningful to me. That was really the beginning of a different kind of relationship.” ut Daniel didn’t want a relationship with Renée. He wasn’t interested, aged 18, when Carole first mentioned that his biological mother really wanted to meet him. Renée put it down to his age. “A lot of 18-year-old boys don’t want to have a relationship with ,” she laughs. She hoped he’d change his mind by the time he was 21. “Then that passed. And I thought, well, maybe when he finds a woman, because you know how women get people together … ” Daniel’s father, Don, died in 2008. Daniel became a video-game software engineer, moved to Germany, moved back to Los Angeles, turned 30 in 2018, and married his German wife in 2019. Carole sent Renée pictures of the wedding, with Daniel’s consent. Every so often, Carole would ask him if he was interested in meeting Renée. He never was. “Honestly, I don’t know why,” Daniel Wilkins, now 36, tells me with a deep sigh. “I think it’s kind of selfishness. I hate to say it. I’m not a parent, so I don’t have that connection to what it would be like.” We’re speaking over Zoom; he’s in Bavaria visiting his in-laws, and as soon as he appears on my screen I am struck by how much he shares Renée’s slim face. But Daniel says he never had any curiosity about his genetic ancestry. “I didn’t think it was such a big deal,” he shrugs. Carole had always been so upfront about how she came to be his mother, and it left Daniel with no desire to know who his biological mother was. “There’s not a ton of drama around this for me because it was always out in the open.” He can’t even remember being told that he had been conceived from an egg that was stolen rather than donated. He assumes it must have been sometime in his teens. “It’s interesting that I can’t remember when we delineated between those two,” he muses. “But I do know that it was in a way that was just not very shocking.” (Carole remembers, of course. “I was really scared to tell him,” she says, her voice low. “I was afraid that he would feel tainted.” But Daniel was far too pragmatic to take the circumstances of his conception personally. “His response was completely the opposite from what I feared.”) curious. And, as she began to Google Asch and the scandal, she found an interview where Renée spoke about the pain of never knowing the son created from her stolen egg. With Laura’s encouragement, Daniel sent Renée an email. And then, last year, they had a Zoom call. Before he logged on, Daniel was nervous. “In my life, I can pick and choose – I can hire people that I like to work with, I can be around friends that I like. , not so much,” he tells me. “I was afraid that we weren’t going to get along. There’s all that pressure to materialise into someone she’d been thinking about for all these years. There was this connection that she missed, and I didn’t feel like there was a part of me missing.” But he needn’t have worried. “She was lovely,” he grins. They spoke for about an hour, with Laura joining at the end. ,” Renée beams. “He had his notebook, I had my notebook. He asked some really good questions.” Renée told him about her life, her best friends, her hobbies. “Afterwards, I was walking on air.” “She seemed a lot more young and hip than I was expecting – jetskiing and stuff like that,” Daniel says, “and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s super badass.’ I was really intrigued, because my birth mom – my mom! – you’d never catch her dead on a jetski. So that was really cool.” Just before Christmas 2024, after waiting nearly three decades, Renée finally got to meet Daniel in person. The moment itself was anticlimactic: they bumped into each other in the parking lot of the Long Beach steak house where they had agreed to have dinner. Daniel arrived with Laura, Renée came with her boyfriend her second marriage having ended in divorce and with Matthew and his wife. “I went up to all of them and give them a big hug,” Daniel says. “We hugged, we hugged, we hugged,” Renée tells me, her eyes shut. “It was just wonderful hugging my son.” Daniel was struck by his half-brother’s narrow face and high cheekbones. Then he looked at Renée, and realised that it all came from her. “It was like seeing long-lost friends, or long-lost family,” she continues, her hand on her heart. “No one talked about the past. We just talked about current and future things. We talked and talked and talked.” At one point, the waiter came over to ask if they were celebrating anything. “I kind of just froze – like, are we?” Daniel says. “How does one put a label on what this is?” They never spoke about what had happened at UCI – to the extent that Renée still doesn’t know that Carole has told Daniel that the egg used to create him was stolen. But, from their first conversation on Zoom, Renée wanted him to know how she felt about him. “I said, ‘Your mom doesn’t really think of me as your mother, but . She’s your mother, she raised you, that will never be taken away of from her. But I think of you as my son.’” When I ask Carole how she describes Renée’s relationship to Daniel, her answer is immediate. “Genetic mother,” she replies. “It took me a while to integrate the word ‘mother’.” For a long time, she didn’t know how to frame it: Renée can’t be called an egg donor, because she never donated. “There is no language for this. There really isn’t.” “I consider Carole part of my family. And we family,” Renée says, her fingers drawing branches of a family tree on the table in front of her. “It’s different, but we are a family.” aniel doesn’t seem to know how to feel about Asch. “I feel sorry that he affected other people’s lives. Personally, I’m happy I’m here, which would not have been the case if he didn’t do what he did. I’m not grateful at all to him, but I wouldn’t say I’m angry … I’m angry on behalf of other people whose lives were uprooted.” , Asch is still living in Mexico and practising as a fertility specialist, even though, as success rates for IVF have continued to improve, Gift has fallen out of favour. In a , Asch waxes lyrical on his career helping people create their families, omitting to mention all the nonconsensual families like Carole and Renée’s that he also created. Balmaceda whose son is the Game of Thrones actor Pedro Pascal returned to the US to receive a “Asch had no consequences. And we’re all stuck picking up the pieces,” Renée says. “But, deep down, I really feel like the doctors were doing it to help more people have babies. I don’t think they were doing it maliciously, I really don’t. They had all the money they needed at that point.” She shrugs. “I could be totally wrong.” Perhaps it is easier for her to live with the idea they were motivated by compassion rather than malice or money. Carole has a different take. “It was ego, arrogance, God complex,” she says, simply. “Asch is still doing egg donation. That’s been making me crazy for 30 years.” The UCI fertility scandal may sound like a product of its time. But don’t be fooled, Renée says. “It seems like every week I read about incidents where people went through IVF and got it was supposed to be. IVF is a good thing, but people need to know that things can go wrong.” Carole is clear about the power of assuming good faith – and the benefits of being honest with donor-conceived children, even in the most fraught circumstances. “I really believe that genetic identity matters. You’re always going to be their mommy. As I tell my clients, children don’t reject their parents because they don’t share DNA – they reject them for other reasons! The truth will set you free.” Daniel says he is looking forward to getting to know Renée better. “When we were leaving the restaurant, he said, ‘Let’s do this again.’ That warmed my heart,” she tells me, with tears in her eyes. After years of restraint and patience, of never trying to find out where Daniel lived, never Googling him, never stalking him on social media, after decades of respecting what Carole and Daniel want, Renée is finally reaping the rewards. “It’s been a very hard journey. But if I had done things differently, I might never have got to this day.” The older he gets, Daniel tells me, the more grateful he is for his two mothers, who both wanted him so much. “I’m thankful for the way things unfolded, and the way they handled it,” he says. “I had some fears about meeting Renée. But how could she be a decent, lovely person, having allowed me a normal childhood – even though it came at the cost of her own happiness.”",Jenny Kleeman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/perfect-morning-routine-happy-healthy-start-showers-sunshine,"The perfect morning routine: how to build a happy, healthy start to the day – from showers to sunshine",2025-12-26T16:00:13.000Z,"You don’t have to wake at 5am or commit to hardcore exercise. But by working out a handful of habits that suit you, and introducing them slowly, you can change your life he first thing to say about the ideal morning routine is that it probably doesn’t exist. Yes, endless influencers promise that they have tweaked, tested and fine-tuned the process of revving up for the day, but how history’s most productive people get things done is so varied that it’s hard to draw definitive conclusions. Beethoven, reportedly, used to count out exactly 60 beans for his morning cup of coffee, while Victor Hugo downed two raw eggs after reading a daily missive from his mistress. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, wakes at for pre-workout prayer, chasing up his gym time with a few holes of golf and a jolt in the cryo chamber before he even thinks about doing any work. It is clear, though, that having some sort of routine is key: a set of automatic actions that you do every day, to ease you into your responsibilities with a bit of momentum and a fresh frame of mind. And there is some stuff that seems beneficial enough that everyone should be doing a version of it, even if individual methods differ: one person’s meditative bean arithmetic, after all, is another’s mindfulness. But if you want to finesse your routine, the key is to add one change at a time. When you focus on a single behaviour,” says the behaviour change specialist Dr Heather McKee, “you build confidence through quick wins, and give your brain the clarity and dopamine hit it needs to automate that action. Once that habit feels natural, you free up mental space to layer in the next change.” But what habits should you be building? First things first: there’s no single best time to get up. If you have the luxury of picking your own window, it’s probably best to start by roughly working out your chronotype, which boils down to if you feel and perform best earlier in the day, you can probably get away with getting up a bit earlier (if you do your best work at night, of course, it would be ideal to sleep in). Most adults need between seven and nine hours’ sleep to feel fully functional, and you probably have a good idea of where you fall in that range. In an ideal world, you shouldn’t need an alarm to wake up: if that means going to bed at 10 so you’re feeling fresh by 6am, that’s the way forward. Ellie Hambly, a clinical psychologist specialising in helping families deal with stress, advises getting outside in the morning light. “This is getting harder with daylight hours reducing, but trying to manage your diary around getting some daylight can make a huge difference in your mood.” Morning exposure to natural sunlight plays a key role in keeping our body clock working properly. It suppresses melatonin, boosts serotonin, gets you ready for the day – and at night. If you have a dog or a running habit, great – but it’s even worth poking your head out of the door while you enjoy your morning coffee. “If you can make the time for a short walk without your phone in the morning, the combination of movement and lack of stimulation can help to activate your brain’s default mode network – the set of brain regions engaged in introspection and daydreaming,” says Hambly. “That can help with creative problem-solving and coming up with new ideas. If you don’t have time for a walk, even taking a shower without a podcast can work.” Recently, it’s become fashionable among self-optimisers to claim that you should wait 60-90 minutes to drink your first coffee to avoid an afternoon crash. This sounds plausible, but a published in 2024 concluded that there’s no evidence this happens – and caffeine has also been shown to increase exercise performance in a variety of ways, so it’s definitely worth having a coffee if you’re going to work out (giving it 20-30 minutes to let the effects kick in). Otherwise, just do what’s most comfortable for you. Should you exercise first thing? If you can face it, yes: at least a bit. The best time of day to hit the gym seems to vary depending on your chronotype, specific goals and preferred workout style: morning exercise, for instance, , and strength-building sessions are also if your aim is muscle. But it’s possible that you can “retrain” your body to work out more effectively at different times of day by doing it consistently ( found that both chronotype and habitual training time are important). However, morning workouts seem to have a host of benefits all of their own, from On a more basic note, it’s also just easier to ensure you get your workouts done if you schedule them first thing, with no chance of a random pub invite or work demand getting in the way. If you can’t face a full-on run or dragging the dumbbells out from under the bed, it helps to have a pre-set, full-body routine that’s simple enough to do in your living room while everyone else dashes around eating toast and doing last-minute homework. The “slow” burpee is a winner here: squat down low, put your hands on the floor (between your feet if you can), then step one foot back at a time until you’re in a plank position. Do a press-up if you’ve got it in you, then reverse the whole process to come back to your feet: a handful of these will hit your arms, legs and core while also helping you stretch out stiff joints. Start with five, and work your way up. How cold should your morning shower be? Again, this depends on what you’re going for. There is some evidence that hosing yourself down with frosty water in the morning can offer physiological benefits: cold exposure can trigger the release of endorphins and help your parasympathetic nervous system (the restful one) kick in, so even if it doesn’t feel like it in the moment, it’s probably cheering you up. On the flipside, a cold shock is potentially going to jolt you out of any default mode network thinking that’s helping you to solve problems or think creatively. But there’s a best-of-both-worlds approach. “I recommend to my coaching clients that they introduce hot and cold cycling as part of their morning routine for both the physical and mental benefits,” says the wellness expert Tana Hoffman Cook. “For people who are just starting out, even ending your shower with a cold blast can offer health benefits – cold exposure has been linked to increased dopamine levels, making it a powerful addition to anyone’s morning routine when they want to start their day feeling alert, clear-headed and with a mood-boost.”. What about journalling, which is frequently recommended? A 2018 found that writing about stressful or emotional events for a few minutes resulted in improvements in physical and psychological health in non-clinical and clinical populations. “Morning pages”, as they’re sometimes known, can work as a sort of lower-stakes version of that: aiming to fill a page or two with judgment-free scribble (that you’re definitely allowed to throw away afterwards) might help you reorganise your thoughts before you go about your day, or at least get your biggest worries down on paper. If you’re struggling to get anything out, use a prompt as an easy starting point: “What’s the biggest thing I’m worried about?” or “What’s one thing I want to focus on today?” Or you could be more specific with something like: “How am I actually going to get this project done on time?” As for meditation, the benefits are – they range from reduced anxiety to a boosted immune system – but if your mornings are too chaotic to sit in a quiet space (or plug into an app for 10 minutes), it might be worth starting with something a bit simpler. “I use something called the Ease morning routine to start the day with nervous system regulation rather than jumping straight into hustle mode,” says the wellbeing coach and yoga teacher Chloe Markham. “We begin with an Exhale, or stillness. If I don’t have time to meditate, I’ll use the 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in gently through your nose for a count of four, hold for seven, and breathe out through your mouth for eight. Next, we Anchor – this is where we clock in with the way our body feels and maybe set a soft intention for the day.” Spend a second listening to your body, she suggests, and maybe change your goals accordingly. “If you’re feeling energised, great! If not, maybe scale things back a bit. The next step is movement, or Shift – this is about moving our bodies in ways that feel good – and the final step is to Engage in something nourishing: read a line of poetry, sip your tea, write a quick reflection or get through a couple of pages of a book.” Whether it takes five minutes or 95, she says, “this sort of routine cannot only prepare us for a calmer day, but also can strengthen our nervous system’s ability to self-regulate more quickly. The magic comes from consistency rather than perfection.” And if all that takes too much time, you could try to sneak in a bit of mindfulness while you do the washing-up: in , a group of volunteers who read a text that encouraged them to focus their thoughts on the sensations evoked by the activity they were doing reported increases in elements of “positive affect” (such as inspiration) and decreased nervousness. “You don’t need a 5am wake-up call or a one-hour ritual to have a ‘good’ morning,” says the yoga teacher Maysun Hassanaly. “What matters is consistency. Think small daily doses of feelgood moments to lift your mood, that are useful and doable. Think of your mornings in three layers: must-do, nice-to-have and optional. On busy days, stick to your must-dos: the simple actions that ground you or energise you. On slower mornings, add a nice-to-have or two. It could be something as small as putting on your favourite song and having a quick dance, walking one extra bus stop, or taking a moment to notice the morning light. Tiny rituals like these help you feel calmer and in control of your day, without sacrificing sleep or overloading your to-do list.” You can’t micromanage everything that’s going to happen for the rest of the day, or everything that’s going on in the world – so for 10 minutes after you wake up, why not just be a bit nicer to yourself?",Joel Snape,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-five councils have discussed a four-day week policy and one, South district council, has already moved to the pattern. While councils are free to set their own policies, the government has the power to take control if an authority is deemed to be failing. In a letter to councils seen by the , Steve Reed said that staff doing “part-time work for full-time pay” could be an indicator of “failure”. He said: “The provision the current guidance makes in relation to the four-day week remains in force … I take this issue very seriously, in particular that ‘council staff undertaking part-time work for full-time pay without compelling justification’ would be considered an indicator, among a wide range of factors, of potential failure. “I hope that makes my position on this matter and the government’s policy unambiguously clear to all councils. We will set out further detail in due course in the new best value guidance.” The best value guidance for local authorities, last issued under the Conservatives in 2024, is being updated by Labour. Earlier this year, Reed wrote to South Cambridgeshire warning that the four-day week policy had damaged its performance. Reed wrote to Bridget Smith, the council’s Liberal Democrat leader, noting there had been a Smith said she was extremely disappointed to have received Reed’s letter, describing the authority as “exceptionally high performing”. Proponents of the four-day week, such as the 4 Day Week Foundation, argue that the nine-to-five, five-day working week is outdated and no longer suits the realities of modern life. They say British workers put in some of the longest full-time hours across Europe, yet have one of the least productive economies.​ A four-day, 32-hour working week with no loss of pay would lead to improved performance and lower costs, they argue.",Jamie Grierson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/18/mar-a-lago-face-plastic-surgery,Plastic surgeons wrestle with requests for ‘Mar-a-Lago face’: ‘You’re going to look like Maleficent’,2025-11-18T16:33:28.000Z,"The puffy, artificial look is rising in popularity - thanks to Maga elite such as Kristi Noem and Matt Gaetz icture a plastic surgeon’s office. You might imagine a sleek Los Angeles practice, with discreet entrances meant to conceal celebrities from the paparazzi. Maybe a Dallas high-rise, where monied housewives spend on postpartum “mommy makeovers”. Or a Miami location, where influencers and OnlyFans stars film TikToks of their BBLs. One city you might not think of is . But its buttoned-up reputation belies a newly buzzing industry. Much has been made of the so-called “Mar-a-Lago face”, or the uncannily smooth and artificially voluminous features seen on the likes of Maga elite such as Kristi Noem, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Laura Loomer and Matt Gaetz. The bee-sting puffy lips, frozen brows and taut necks have been compared to and – ironically, considering the Republican party’s anti-LGBTQ+ culture war – As of January, plastic surgeons in Washington DC have seen a “surge in ‘Mar-a-Lago face’ requests from Trump insiders”, Axios recently . Surgeons told the outlet that more Washingtonians want their procedures to be not unnoticed but obvious and overdone. Axios attributed the aesthetic shift to the influx of transplants from south Florida (where , Trump’s gaudy private club, is located), who are no strangers to nip-tuck tune-ups. Others theorize that going through these procedures is a calculated act of political deference to Trump’s preferred (and unnatural) beauty standards. Dr Anita Kulkarni is a plastic surgeon who practices out of DC’s West End neighborhood and specializes in postpartum body contouring. Enter her office, and you will be greeted by staff who look good, but not worked on – and that is the effect most of her clients have gone for. “Before this second Trump term, I just didn’t see a lot of patients coming in making unreasonable requests,” Kulkarni says. But since the inauguration, she has fielded half a dozen or more – not a large sample size, but enough for the surgeon to take note. She says nobody comes in asking for Mar-a-Lago face by name; the most obvious clue is when a patient with visible lip filler comes in wanting more. “I have to say: ‘I cannot put any more in there safely.’” Or they will want more cheek or jawline filler. “‘To my eye, if I put any more in there, you’re going to cross over from looking like the best version of yourself to looking like Maleficent.’ I have to say no in a way that I have never seen before.” And still patients will try to talk their way into more. But placing fresh filler over an existing layer too soon can cause lumpiness, and Kulkarni does not want to risk being known for that look. “My aesthetic doesn’t necessarily have to be your aesthetic for me to give you what you want,” she says. “But when you go outside the range of what a normal human face should look like, that’s not a place I’m willing to go.” More still might shrug their shoulders and say Mar-a-Lago face is part of society’s facelift may look less garish than Laura Loomer’s balloonish attributes, but both are just as fake. It comes at a time when the American Society of Plastic Surgeons there were more than 28.5m minimally invasive procedures done in 2024; lip augmentation, dermal fillers and neuromodulator treatments (such as Botox) cracked the top five. Dr Troy Pittman, a plastic surgeon based in DC, says that across the country, people are more willing to talk about the work they have had done. “That’s not a bad thing,” he says. “But in a town like DC, there is this glamming up of Washington with this new administration, so it’s become more prevalent. They’re OK with looking enhanced.” Dr Kelly Bolden is also a DC-based plastic surgeon. Most of her clients are people of color – she is the medical director of Cultura Dermatology, a practice that specializes in cosmetic treatments for deeper skin tones – and she is not seeing a boom in Mar-a-Lago face requests. But she has noticed a shift, especially among her younger clients in their 20s and 30s. “They come in and actually tell me that they like the artificial look. A couple of my patients have said those exact words to me,” Bolden says. Some of the most visible Trump officials are young, such as press secretary Karoline Leavitt and her deputy Anna Kelly (both 28, and the latter is a former pageant queen), and they’re always . “I think most of [Trump’s] administration is on the younger side compared to traditional ones, so that’s probably a little bit of where the trend comes from.” Those who want a Mar-a-Lago face have to be able to handle needles: Bolden says it is most often achieved via shots and injectables underneath the skin. “It’s overdone filler and Botox that gives them that mask-face type of appearance.” This is not a look Bolden is known for. Sometimes, she outright denies these requests. Or she will compromise. “Usually I’ll look at them and say: ‘Let’s balance you out, let’s make it more even.’ It’s almost like just as long as they get a little bit more, it will satisfy them,” she says. After the Duchess of Sussex announced her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, Pittman said women would bring photos of Meghan to appointments and ask for her nose. “That’s a trap,” Pittman says. “We’re not trying to make people look like clones of each other.” He would similarly talk down someone who brought in a picture of Ivanka or Melania Trump. “Whenever people come in asking for a branded look, that can lead to either very unrealistic expectations or artificial results.” Other plastic surgeons advertise Mar-a-Lago face. A practice out of Boca Raton, Florida – less than an hour away from Mar-a-Lago – it a procedure that “doesn’t scream surgery. Instead, it whispers refinement.” Dr Shervin Naderi, based in the DC area, described the look as “a modern aristocratic mask” in his practice’s When does a patient know it’s time to ease up on the procedures? Bolden says it’s common not to; the industry term is perception blindness. “The first time someone gets filler, the majority of the time, it looks good,” she said. “Then people get used to it, and they see a wrinkle come back or some sagging, and they’re like, ‘I need more.’ They’re chasing after something without realizing it. A little bit more, a little bit more, and you can’t really see the evolution.” The aesthetics of politics have long been an uneasy topic, especially as it relates to women. Nicole Russell, a columnist at USA Today, jokes about Mar-a-Lago face “cruel attacks” on conservative women. To others, the face has come to symbolize an allegiance to Trump and his policies. See Noem wearing full glam to an ICE raid, beach waves tumbling over her bulletproof vest. Or Leavitt at the press podium, means nothing, as she purses overlined pink lips to match her shimmery eye shadow. Men are not spared the political aesthetic shift either. Ninety-two per cent of surgeons treating male patients, with facelifts and sculpted jawlines being top picks. Pittman told Axios his male patients want to look “younger … more virile and masculine” like Pete Hegseth, via Botox, liposuction and eyelid rejuvenation. A fitting counter to Maga’s leading women. But, just like trends, administrations ebb and flow. Mar-a-Lago face won’t last forever – literally. “Nothing in plastic surgery is permanent,” Bolden says. “Filler goes away. Most people will say you get a good eight to 10 years out of a facelift. Everything has a lifespan.”",Alaina Demopoulos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other local authorities should take note n a windswept housing estate by the Channel, Jacob Taylor surveys the latest addition to his property empire: a mixture of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats, built on the playing fields of an old private school. They might not look like much but these neat rows of redbrick homes are an important acquisition – not for an offshore investor or a real-estate mogul, but for the Labour-run and Hove city council, where Taylor, its deputy leader, is taking a trailblazing approach. “We are essentially rapidly buying properties from private landlords,” he says, walking through the plot in the Sussex village of Rottingdean, where Rudyard Kipling once lived. In a plan agreed this month, the council is spending £50m to acquire 200 homes over the next two years, with the aim of replenishing its heavily depleted stock of social homes and temporary accommodation. in reverse. Taking chunks of private property into public hands, Taylor aims to tackle a worsening housing and homelessness crisis in the seaside city, where as many as 10 more people are sleeping rough every week. “The housing crisis is so bad in Brighton – we have near-London house prices but don’t have London wages,” he says. “It’s actually been getting worse in the last year, not better. “You can’t underestimate the impact it’s having on people. As yet, I haven’t got enough homes versus the demand. But I am not going to put up with this disaster. I am determined to dramatically reduce the problem.” Other councils, and the government, should take note. shortages, spiralling rents, and the cost to local authorities of housing families in temporary accommodation – funnelling public money into the pockets of private landlords – are a massive national problem. In this all-encompassing economic and social crisis sweeping the country, Brighton is but a microcosm. More than 1.3 million families in England are on social housing waiting lists, enough to fill . Their ranks have swelled by 37% since 2015, and a record 164,040 children are homeless and stuck in temporary accommodation, double the number in 2012. For the worst three councils, all in London, it would Brighton is fairly middle of the pack in the national picture, with about 5,000 households on its register. However, the wait is long enough that a child born today could finish secondary school without finding a council home. David Chaffey, the chief executive of BHT Sussex, a social housing provider that also supports rough sleepers in Brighton and Hove, says the lack of affordable housing is causing untold social misery and strangling the local economy. “You need to be able to have adequate housing for people to work in your local economy. Jobs can’t be filled. We have helped people who were working in a full-time job but living in their cars before they came to us, as they just can’t afford the rent here.” When Rachel Reeves talks about “ ”, this is exactly what she means. Britain’s social foundations have been stripped bare, eroded by years of neoliberal policymaking, flatlining growth, and under-investment. Brighton’s story shows the scale of the challenge to overcome. Above the windswept white cliffs, one cause of Brighton’s housing crisis is immediately clear. and rents are well above average thanks in part to its fast train line to London, which makes it attractive to affluent City commuters. “DFLs, we call them,” Chaffey says. The acronym means “down from London”. However, another cause is more pernicious: the erosion of the council’s housing stock under Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy scheme. Since 1980, of homes locally have been sold off. Many are now student HMOs (houses in multiple occupation) or are rented out by private landlords, often to tenants on housing benefit or in council-funded temporary accommodation. “If you want to understand why we have huge swaths of the country where the housing market is totally broken, point to that [right to buy],” says Taylor. Although it helped millions of families on to the housing ladder, the Thatcherite policy has been a disaster, in one of the biggest transfers of public wealth to private hands in modern history. Failure to replace these homes has not only deprived councils of stock to house today’s generation of families in need of support. Privatisation has embedded structurally higher housing costs for local authorities. Spending on housing has , with about 90% going on housing benefit. In Brighton the council expects to overspend its budget by about £3.8m on temporary accommodation this year, money Taylor says is flowing entirely to private landlords. “It’s all a consequence of Thatcherism, plus austerity, and not being able to turn the tide on it properly. “Our aim is to accelerate the increase in stock of social housing, but also to directly reduce the extreme costs of booking temporary accommodation with private landlords, which is pushing us to bankruptcy.” At a national level, Labour’s plan to build 1.5m new homes will help. But it is increasingly in danger of failing to live up to its full billing. At risk of failure to meet the target, ministers could also sacrifice quality, affordability and targeting construction in the places in most need. This could be problematic for Brighton. Wedged between the sea and the South Downs national park, development land here is scarce or costly. Taylor fears ministers – playing a numbers game – might prioritise places with lower development costs when allocating £39bn of funding that the government has earmarked to build a new generation of social homes. However, bit by bit, the tide is ebbing in the opposite direction on the south coast, helped by reversing right to buy.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/22/the-land-trap-by-mike-bird-review-ground-down,The Land Trap by Mike Bird review – ground down,2025-12-22T09:00:23.000Z,"A masterful introduction to the economics of our most basic asset he landlord is a gentleman who does not earn his wealth … his sole function, his chief pride, is the consumption of wealth produced by others.” It was 1909, and a liberal politician was launching an assault on a class of people who – in the eyes of many – contributed nothing to Britain’s advances in industry while living off its gains. A little over a century after David Lloyd George’s Limehouse speech, and it feels as though the issue of land has returned to politics: an analysis of MPs’ financial interests revealed that a quarter of all Tory MPs earned more than £10,000 from renting out property, while 44 Labour MPs – 11% – did the same. The winner of the most dazzling political campaign of the past year, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made “freeze the rent” his central pledge. On the right, a revolt against property taxes is gathering pace. Journalist Mike Bird’s history of the most basic asset arrives, then, at an opportune moment. Land ownership has, of course, been critically important for most of history, tied up with financial independence and social status. But its role changed dramatically with the Industrial Revolution and the growth of cities. The most valuable companies in the world now design chips, develop software or extract oil. The wealthiest escape high taxes by relocating to the Gulf, and some dream of “network states”, virtual countries that organise and govern themselves online. Henry George, the journalist and economic thinker who called for a single tax – on land – was widely read in the 19th century but is now largely forgotten. George saw monopolies of land ownership as the source of economic inefficiency and the root of inequality, since the gains from land increasing in value went to landlords and speculators rather than productive businesses. But since the early 20th century, politics on the left has been organised around class, and on the right around questions of identity and personal liberty. The rise of widespread property ownership seemed, for a time, to have taken the sting out of land as a political issue. George’s only substantial legacy was the board game invented to spread his ideas, The Landlord’s Game, better known to most children in its later incarnation: Monopoly. Bird charts the return of land as a central economic and political force. Real estate was used as collateral for loans which enabled the creation and expansion of businesses, and it became a source of revenue for companies too: McDonald’s, which is built on a franchise model and owns the land where many of its franchises are located, makes more money from rent than it does from royalties on Big Macs and the rest of its menu. For decades, property has been central to China’s economic growth, with local governments relying on land sales for revenue and citizens investing their life savings in the sector. The real estate boom has weakened dynamism in other sectors. Bird suggests the country now faces a painful choice: allow prices to crash and wipe out middle-class wealth, let prices stay high and sap the rest of the economy, or resign itself to gradual stagnation. This is the “land trap” of the title. There are a few important absences in Bird’s narrative. There’s little on the role of engineering and technology, for example. “Buy land, they’re not making it any more” is the famous saying, but in fact that’s false: steel frames and elevators allowed Chicago to become a city in the sky, while the Hoover Dam’s water raised Las Vegas from the Mojave Desert. Surprisingly, there’s nothing on how floods and wildfires intensified by climate change can destroy the value of land, though that’s an increasing prospect everywhere from the Gulf coast of the US to the Mediterranean, with ownership structures amplifying the unfairness. When fields flood, tenant farmers with the least resources suffer most and find it hardest to rebuild. The central puzzle of land is arguably its failure to keep pace with improvements in other aspects of life: the devices people scroll on may be vastly more sophisticated than the dumbphones of the 1990s, but the quality of the homes they live in has improved little in the past century. This book is a masterly introduction to the economics of land ownership, though it has less to say about the social consequences. Private landlords have little incentive to invest when they can easily fill the homes they let out, while states increasingly lack the funds for repair and renovation. The combination of a shabby private rental sector (its expansion fuelled in Britain by the buy-to-let mortgages created 29 years ago) and shrinking public provision, stripped away by right-to-buy, is one of the main reasons land has become a salient issue once again. The system we created has failed to give people the shelter they need, and instead facilitated the return of slums.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/26/nhs-bme-staff-britain-fails-appreciate-roles,‘The NHS would collapse within hours’: BME staff say Britain fails to appreciate their roles,2025-12-26T20:00:18.000Z,"Long-serving workers say they faced racism as they helped build health service – but it ‘seems things have got worse’ “I am fed up of being called names. I know I am Black. I was born Black. And I love being Black. So tell me something I don’t know.” Those words, uttered 50 years ago as a young nurse facing regular racial abuse from patients on a London hospital ward, were a turning point in Allyson Williams’s life and career. Williams had come to the UK in 1969 from the anglophile culture of the postwar Caribbean – where children of all ethnicities learned English literature, grammar and history by heart – only to be attacked in “the mother country”. She is now among those who, having dedicated their lives to the , fear the UK still does not properly appreciate the outsize contribution made to UK healthcare by Black, ethnic minority and overseas-born or trained staff – decades after Windrush generation nurses held up the service in its earliest years. Those professionals included Deloris James, who was born a British citizen in St Kitts and Nevis and moved to Cardiff as 10-year-old in 1964. She was “pushed” into a career in the NHS, following after her mother who was a midwife – 12 other relatives also worked in the health service. “The stories I hear, it seems as if things have got worse than when I was in the NHS,” said James, 71, who worked as a nurse and midwife. “I’m not saying there wasn’t racism, but it seems so much more prevalent.” , with rising racism and changes to immigration rules blamed for the fall. In an interview with the Guardian, the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Jeanette Dickson, said the NHS was being put at risk because foreign health professionals increasingly saw the UK as an “unwelcoming, racist” country. Between April and September, 6,321 nurses and midwives from abroad joined the register of those licensed to practise in the UK, compared with 12,534 who did so in the same period in 2024. In October, the Royal College of Nursing revealed the number of reports by nurses of racist incidents at work had risen by 55% over three years. , with 4,880 doctors who qualified in another country leaving the UK during 2024, a rise of 26% on the 3,869 who did so the year before, according to the General Medical Council. Williams, a writer who came to the UK in 1969 and spent 40 years in the NHS as a nurse, midwife, manager and clinical leader, said: “It’s been over 50 years and nobody has learned any lessons. Nobody has seen fit to congratulate or to thank the multi-ethnic people who have come – in our generation to ‘rebuild the country’, that was how it was put to us. “I came at a time of brain drain when so many English people had gone to Canada and America and Australia. When I got into the hospital, and in my class, there were 30 girls who were training. One was English, four Irish and the rest were West Indians and west African – of the West Indians, there were 14 of us from Trinidad alone. “The training and the social life was amazing, but there was a lot of racism from the patients. They would slap you or hit you or push you away. I was called the ‘N’ word. I was told I was nasty. It was quite disturbing.” After a year, Williams told her mother “she couldn’t take it any more”, that she felt as if she was “walking on glass”. But her mother told her: “You have a dream. You have wanted to be a nurse since you were small. The racism is their problem. You just get on with your career and find a way to deal with them.” “It actually led me to make that big stand on the ward,” Williams, who celebrated the moment in the title of her autobiography, , said. “I don’t know where it came from … it was the most empowering statement I’ve ever made – from that point on, [racism] just never bothered me.” Williams would move on to midwifery, where there was much less racism and where she found “bringing life into the world was such a privilege”. She said: “Every now and then you would get a woman saying she doesn’t want to have a Black midwife. But the managers then were very strict. They would say ‘they’re all we have and they’re the best – you either have a Black midwife or you pack up and you go somewhere else’.” Decades on, and not every Black, ethnic minority, or overseas-born or trained medic feels they can rely on colleagues for support. revealed Black or minority ethnic (BME) women (15.6%) were most likely to have experienced discrimination from other staff in the last 12 months, and 51% of NHS trusts reported BME staff were over 1.25 times more likely than white staff to enter formal disciplinary processes. At 80% of NHS trusts, white applicants were significantly more likely than BME applicants to be appointed from shortlisting. Alison Hewitt is the second generation of her family to devote her working life to the NHS. Her aunt was a Windrush generation nurse and her mother was a children’s nurse – but Hewitt broke the mould to train in radiography 35 years ago, when Black radiographers were a rarity. She said: “I think a lot of the Windrush nurses kept their mouth shut. Whereas nowadays, you’re constantly battling HR.” But despite the discrimination and disparities, 28.6% of staff in NHS trusts are Black or minority ethnic and about 20% non-UK nationals. “There’s at least 27 countries represented where I work,” Hewitt said. “If the Black staff, the Asian staff and the foreign-born staff all went home, the NHS would collapse within hours. We’ve always been brought in to do the difficult work.” Nonetheless, Hewitt believes that if anything is driving turnover of staff in the NHS, it is “economic betterment” – and Williams agrees. “Where do you go in the world where there is no racism?” Williams said. “It’s a global, international problem. But what you might find [outside the UK] is that the wages are better or there’s something else to compensate for it.” Saada Maida, a 41-year-old gynaecologist from Leamington Spa who came to the UK as a refugee from Syria, said NHS staff of all backgrounds shared the common challenge of coping with patients with diverse needs in a “systematically underfunded” system, but stressed he had been made to feel welcome – and felt “the UK is one of the least racist nations”. He added: “The common denominator between these people leaving is feeling somehow that they’re not appreciated in the NHS – if you take a contract in the Gulf, we know it’s systematically full of inequalities, more so than the UK, but the pay is better. I think all doctors or healthcare professionals leaving the NHS, I think the incentive, whether they admit it or not, is to a great extent financial.” Having seen so many members of her family devote their lives to the NHS, James worries that the service she knew will be lost to , as well as the pressures facing its “wonderful” staff. “It makes me feel very sad,” James added. “Here we are again, back to the 50s, when people were invited to come to Britain to work and rebuild and, when they do arrive, then they face these hostilities.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/25/uk-new-towns-plan-may-not-help-the-people-who-need-housing-most-say-critics,Key figures in creation of Milton Keynes criticise England’s new towns plan,2025-12-25T11:00:38.000Z,"Exclusive: Planners behind postwar new towns hit out at government over lack of ambition and commitment to social housing Senior planners involved in building the country’s postwar new towns have raised concerns about the government’s new towns programme, criticising a lack of ambition and insufficient commitment to social housing. Lee Shostak, former director of planning at Development Corporation (MKDC) in the 1970s and later chair of the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), said the current plan for the new towns may not help people who need homes the most. He said that while Milton Keynes was designed specifically to ease the housing burden in London with a large stock of council housing, there was a real risk these new towns would do little to alleviate council house waiting lists in big cities. “There’s talk about 40% of the homes as affordable housing, most of which will not be social housing and there’s no indication whatsoever those homes will be available for people moving from London or other urban areas,” said Shostak. “So the very basic, simple premise that kickstarted the original new towns programme isn’t being followed through today. No one is addressing the question: if you can’t afford to buy, will you be able to move to a new town?” In September, the government’s new towns taskforce , as part of the prime minister’s commitment to building and solving the country’s housing crisis. Keir Starmer said he wants to begin building at least three new towns this parliament, and commence work on more if possible. Shostak said none of the proposed new towns were on the scale of Milton Keynes or other large new towns, and he was concerned whether there was the strength of leadership and resources behind the project for it to make a substantial difference. “Many of the areas designated for the fourth generation of new towns are not actually standalone new towns at all – they’re modest expansions of existing communities, and some are regeneration projects within existing towns and cities,” he said. “So the challenge will be to bring the prosperity, the excitement and the vision.” John Walker, who became planning director of MKDC in 1980 and went on to become chief executive of the Commission for the New Towns, said that while the new towns were an exciting prospect, there were worries about how it was being executed. “I am concerned that it’s not ambitious enough. There’s nowhere that would compare with the later-stage new towns,” he said. “I don’t think it is going to be enough, and I’m ambivalent about whether it’s going to produce the sort of results that people want to see.” Both arrived in Milton Keynes when it was mainly mud and building sites – “it really was Frontierland”, Walker said – and watched its population swell as homes were built at a pace of about 3,000 a year. They said the key to the new programme’s success would be the creation of government-backed new town corporations with land ownership and planning powers that could deliver homes and infrastructure at scale. Without that, there are fears the project may lack momentum, and the private sector may be unwilling to take on risk. “There’s very little point in talking about doing more new towns if all you’re going to do is draw a big blob on a plan and say one day that will be a new town – you’ve got to accelerate the pace,” he said. Shostak added: “Milton Keynes didn’t just happen because it was a good location. We made it happen because we were given the powers and the resources to make it happen. That’s the opportunity has today, to do it again.” While some of the proposed new town locations have been welcomed, there has been a backlash in others. In the village of Adlington in , there has been anger from local residents over proposals to build 20,000 new homes on their doorstep in a new standalone development. It has been formally opposed by Cheshire East council, while the leader of neighbouring Stockport council, Mark Roberts, likened it to “someone in a boardroom in Westminster throwing a dart at a map”. “It’s not an exaggeration to say the whole village is traumatised,” said Aysha Hawcutt, an Adlington resident campaigning to stop the new town going ahead. “If we could see in our local area there was a need for the sort of housing that’s going to be built, then I think we would accept it more. But we know these plans don’t fix any problem, they just make money for a private company.” Katy Lock, the director of communities at the TCPA, said “there was no strategic approach to identifying locations” for the new towns and there had not been enough public engagement in the process. “There is such mistrust in planning in the public’s mind and there is an opportunity with this new towns programme to be more transparent and bring people along in the process – and I feel that opportunity has been missed,” she said. She said new towns were a chance to create “exemplar high quality places that are genuinely affordable” and with the right environmental standards – “however, to make that happen there needs to be a real change”, she said. A spokesperson for theMinistry of Housing, and Local Government said: “We reject these claims. We welcome the Taskforce recommendation that 40% of the homes in our new towns should be affordable housing, and our New Towns programmes will restore the dream of homeownership for families across the country, helping fix the housing crisis we inherited. “We continue to work closely with local leaders to ensure these towns will be in the right places and have the necessary infrastructure.” The headline of this article was amended on 26 December 2025 because an earlier version referred to the UK when the plan relates to England.",Jessica Murray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/disabled-people-in-england-betrayed-by-cuts-to-new-build-accessibility-targets,Disabled people in England ‘betrayed’ by cuts to new-build accessibility targets,2025-12-19T17:57:47.000Z,"Campaigners decry plan to reduce requirement for improved standards from 100% down to 40% of new homes Government plans to make huge cuts to targets for accessible new-build homes in have been labelled a “monumental reversal” by campaigners, who say disabled people have been left feeling “betrayed and excluded”. In its proposals for changes to the country’s planning system, the government said a minimum of 40% of new-build homes would be built to improved accessibility standards – M4(2) – which include step-free access and wider doorways and corridors. The proposals set no minimum target for the proportion of wheelchair accessible – M4(3) – new-build homes, which disability campaigners believe should be at least 10%. The move is a big climbdown from the previous Conservative government’s commitment to making all new homes meet the M4(2) standard as part of a push for better accessibility throughout the housebuilding industry. Mikey Erhardt, policy and campaigns officer at Rights UK, said it was “absolutely incredible to witness the government’s lack of principle” on the issue. “This is a monumental reversal of existing policy. We had been awaiting the plans to implement a previous 100% figure and this decision leaves disabled people feeling betrayed and excluded, and questioning the government’s commitment to disability equality,” he said. “Requiring 100% of all new-build homes to be built to improved accessibility standards, with 10% to wheelchair user standards, would have been the right thing to do, creating a level playing field for developers and sending a strong signal that our housing stock must change to meet the needs of our older and disabled citizens. “The government’s failure of resolve and watered down proposal leaves a bitter taste, raising questions about whose interests are being served.” Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the 40% target was a “pretty timid response, given the reality of a rapidly ageing population”. “While this new measure will help, sadly it will result in only a trickle of new homes suitable for older and disabled people coming onto the market, when really a torrent is required,” she said. Millie Brown, deputy director for homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, said the 40% target was an “important step in the right direction”, although she acknowledged it was a “step back” from the Conservative government’s previous plans. “Of course, the announcement could have gone further,” she said. “We would hope that local authorities are encouraged to view 40% as the minimum to achieve and exceed.” say that 40% of new homes should meet the M4(2) standard, but that councils should “set requirements for M4(2) that meet or exceed their locally assessed need for this housing”. This category of home accessibility requires step-free access, wider doors and entrance-level toilets to make them adaptable for people with limited mobility and older people. Homes built to the M4(3) standard must be fully accessible for full-time wheelchair users, with ample turning spaces and accessible bathrooms and kitchens. Many local authorities set their own targets on this – since 2015, in London the standard has been 90% of homes at M4(2) and 10% at M4(3). But rates fluctuate sharply across the country – analysis by the Centre for Ageing Better found that people living in the East Midlands or north-east of England were six times less likely to be living in a fully accessible home compared with people living in London. Just 13% of homes in England were fully accessible, the research found. The housing secretary, Steve Reed, said the changes to the planning system were part of his plan to “get Britain building” and that “we owe it to the people of this country to do everything within our power to build the homes they deserve”. Mark Gale, policy manager at the disability charity Sense, said he wanted the government reconsider the accessibility targets. “We’re disappointed to hear the government is cutting back on accessibility targets for new homes,” he said. “Inaccessible housing can be a huge barrier to independence for disabled people with complex needs. Sadly, there is often far too little suitable housing stock available, meaning some people have no choice but to live in homes that don’t meet their needs.” , Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “We’ve proposed a robust minimum requirement to drive up the construction of more accessible homes. “We’re currently seeking views on this level through an open consultation to ensure it meet the needs of an ageing population and disabled people.”",Jessica Murray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were about 53,230 care leavers aged 17 to 21 in 2025 and a further 44,430 care leavers aged 22 to 25, although this may be an underestimate, the DHSC said. The health and social care secretary, , said: “Those in care face the toughest start in life and as a result suffer from a barrage of health inequalities, hampering their chances of going on to lead a happy, successful and fulfilling life.” Ministers will also bring in safeguarding measures that will alert GPs if young patients are in care, while a new regulation will allow for information to be rapidly shared across health services. The government has accepted recommendations from Josh MacAlister, who was the first children’s social care adviser and is a former teacher and founder of the charity Frontline, a graduate social worker training programme. MacAlister, the minister for children, families and wellbeing, said: “The disadvantage faced by children who’ve grown up in care is a huge social injustice. That’s why we’re taking cross-government action to transform life chances for these children and care leavers. “This package of health measures will make a tangible difference to reduce health inequalities, keep more children safe and help more families with intensive support. “It also delivers on recommendations from the independent review of children’s social care that I in 2022. This government is delivering meaningful change to break down barriers to opportunity, especially for those in care.” The guaranteed interview scheme is similar to existing NHS policies that guarantee interviews for people with a disability and aims to provide a level playing field for people from a background of being in care, the DHSC said. The job application system will feature an option for candidates to declare if they are a care leaver. If they meet the minimum criteria in the job description, they will then be invited to an interview alongside other shortlisted candidates. Research cited by the DHSC said adults who spent time in care as children between 1971 and 2001 were 70% more likely to die prematurely and care leavers were more likely to experience an unnatural death. The forthcoming children’s wellbeing and schools bill will enshrine in law a requirement for the government and public bodies to take into account the challenges faced by children in care and care leavers and the support they may need when leaving the care system.

The elastane material gives the top a stretchy, comfortable feel, and the fabric’s Silverescent technology wicks sweat and reduces odor, keeping me dry on runs (and letting me get away with washing it less often). I also appreciate the thumb holes, which help keep my hands warm in chilly weather. Whenever I need to layer up but don’t want to sacrifice style, I immediately reach for my FP Movement apparel. This top is one of my favorites from the brand, with a tighter fit that acts as the perfect base layer for more intense speed workouts at my local track. I find its cropped style ideal for pairing with high-waisted leggings. I also love any top with thumb holes, as my hands always get cold quickly on my runs. Until the temperature officially hits freezing, I’m usually clad in my trusty . When the weather makes me reluctantly switch to leggings, my go-to pair is this style from . They’re constructed with a mid-weight fabric that, while thick enough to keep my legs warm, still feels breathable. These leggings have three pockets: one on each leg (where I usually store my keys) and a back pocket designed to keep your phone safe while on the move. I also appreciate the mesh-lined waistband, which helps keep them from slipping. I love layering this fleece from Patagonia over my Lululemon Swiftly Tech. It has everything I want in a second layer: warm Synchilla double-sided fleece to trap in heat and fabric that both wicks moisture and dries fast. I love that the collar goes up to my neck, and I appreciate how the elastic binding on the cuffs helps seal out cold air. Plus, it’s made in a fair-trade-certified factory. A good pair of socks is one of the most underrated items to add to your winter running wardrobe. There’s nothing worse than wearing a pair that exposes your ankles to the elements, or a too-thin material that leaves your ankles covered in blisters. While you can easily spend upwards of $50 on a pair of from Hanes made with a cotton blend, which feels cushiony and doesn’t slip during my runs. There’s nothing quite like freezing fingers to derail a run. Recently, I went on a long run and made the mistake of forgetting my gloves. When I returned, my fingers were so cold, they’d gone numb. With all that being said, a pair of well-constructed gloves is an absolute essential. I love this pair from Athleta, which shields my fingers from the cold without feeling too thick or bulky. If you use your phone to track your runs, this pair also has touchscreen-enabled fingertips and gripping dots – which makes them suitable for To avoid coming back from a run with frozen, bright red ears, you’ll want to grab a hat or winter running headband. I much prefer the former, which I find does a better job of staying in place. This beanie from FP Movement keeps my forehead and ears protected from the wind and snow, thanks to its soft ribbed knit. While the exact style I personally use is no longer sold, the brand makes a similar A well-fitted pair of running shoes is one of the most important tools in any runner’s kit. I thought that nothing could dethrone my beloved Hoka Cliftons, but The Asics Novablast 5 is supportive yet lightweight, making it a versatile shoe that I can wear for both long runs and speed workouts. The outsole has a trampoline-inspired design that gives it bounce, and I love that my feet feel cushioned without feeling too clunky to weigh me down. They’re not waterproof, but they’ve held up well in puddles. Recently, I ran in these through a chilly downpour and, with the help of a few paper towels, they dried in 24 hours. These shoes are bouncier than my Hokas, but somehow feel more supportive, making me feel faster than I probably am. I bought the Garmin Forerunner 165 Music as part of an early Black Friday sale, and apart from showering, it hasn’t left my wrist since. This watch offers a slew of running metrics, including heart rate, pace, power and vertical oscillation (bounce). It also acts as a pocket-sized running coach, suggesting daily workouts tailored to my running goals and recovery. And for the wellness-obsessed: it collects data on my sleep, heart rate variability and stress levels. Between all of its tracking capabilities and its long battery life (up to 11 days in smartwatch mode), plus the ability to download music for offline listening, this watch is well worth the investment.",Lauren Gould,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/25/psychedelic-church-drugs-legal,"Inside the US’s psychedelic church boom, where taking drugs is legal",2025-12-25T13:00:41.000Z,"Religious groups using banned drugs are increasingly testing the limits of faith and law – and winning he Church of Gaia in Spokane, Washington, has all the makings of a traditional place of worship: regular gatherings, communal songs and member donations – except they also serve ayahuasca, a psychedelic substance that can induce nausea and, at times, projectile vomiting. “This is a purely spiritual practice,” said Connor Mize, the ceremonial leader of the Church of Gaia. “It’s not a thing you do just for fun.” Psychedelics are classified as schedule 1 substances and banned throughout most of the US. But a small number of churches have won the right to use them as sacraments: since the 2000s, four organizations have secured legal protections for psychedelic use after protracted battles with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Earlier this year, the Church of Gaia became the first psychedelic church to receive an exemption by petitioning the DEA instead of suing it. “Everybody else has gone through some semblance of litigation to get through the process other than us,” said Mize. Estimates suggest that hundreds of psychedelic churches operate illegally in the US. As court interpretations evolve, religious freedom claims expand and more Americans drift away from traditional religion, these groups are increasingly emerging from the underground to push boundaries over which substances – and beliefs – deserve protection. The Church of Gaia’s win, combined with two recent settlements, makes “three new psychedelic practices recognized in the last year – more than half of all the ones ever recognized”, according to Sean McAllister, an attorney specializing in psychedelic law. The origins of legalized psychedelic churches stretch back to the turn of the century, when 30 gallons of ayahuasca tea were seized from a New Mexico-based religious group. In 2006, the church successfully sued the DEA under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which requires the government to meet a high legal bar before burdening religious practices, setting into motion a new standard for the use of psychedelics. A similar legal victory followed in Oregon three years later. More recently, in 2024 and 2025, churches in Arizona and California received legal protections for psychedelic use after reaching settlements with the DEA. “There is more of an openness now to granting these exceptions, to entering into settlements,” said McAllister. “Part of it is because they’ve lost every time they’ve litigated the case.” Churches can now also pursue exemptions by directly petitioning the DEA to prove that their religious practices are sincere and burdened by drug laws. The route has proved popular: between fiscal year 2016 and January 2024, the agency received petitions from 24 organizations. The Church of Gaia’s green light came after a nearly three-year process that focused largely on proving that ayahuasca would be used only for religious purposes and prevented the church from operating during the petition. While its approval is the first of its kind, more are anticipated. “There are some that are in negotiation processes,” said Taylor Loyden, an attorney with Terrapin Legal, which represented the Church of Gaia. With its legal status secured, the church is planning for the future. Mize is focused on securing visas for Peruvian teachers and constructing a circular, mat-filled building to host ceremonies. There, groups of the Church of Gaia’s nearly 70 members will soon gather for hours-long ceremonies to sip on ayahuasca as they purge, listen to traditional Amazonian songs and practice their faith. Groups benefiting from a thawing federal attitude towards psychedelics might find even more success under Donald Trump, according to legal experts, who pointed to the US president’s emphasis on protecting religious rights. “There is probably in this administration some desire to be a little looser on religious freedom for plant medicine, because that will also help them be looser on religious freedom in other contexts,” said McAllister, who is currently working on two new lawsuits for ayahuasca churches. The number of churches, too, is surging. There are probably more than 500 operating across the US, according to Jeffrey Breau, who leads a psychedelics and spirituality program at Harvard’s Center for the Study of World Religions. “Many of these churches have started within the last five, six, seven years,” said Breau. The growth coincides with a turn to spirituality as Americans fall out of favor with traditional religion. Four in 10 US adults have become more spiritual over the course of their lifetime, according to a , while only 24% say they have become more religious. But operating at the intersection of psychedelics and religion isn’t without risks. Beyond logistical hurdles like securing insurance or property as an underground entity, church leaders must also contend with the fear of hearing law enforcement officials knock at their door. Bridger Jensen, founder of the religious group Singularism, was leaving work last November when he found himself surrounded by a Swat team. An undercover officer had posed as a would-be member of his church, based in Provo, Utah, which uses psilocybin or magic mushrooms in its ceremonies. Police raided Singularism’s center, confiscated its mushrooms and charged Jensen. Singularism responded by suing. Using Utah’s state-level RFRA, the group halted criminal proceedings against Jensen, recovered its seized psychedelics and won permission to continue operating as the case plays out in federal district court. If Singularism ultimately prevails, it would become the first mushroom church ever recognized in the US, potentially opening up the playing field for other psychedelic practices. Thus far, all exempt churches have used ayahuasca, partly due to the substance’s low risk of being used for other purposes compared with other drugs. But underground churches use a variety of substances, including LSD and MDMA and even newer chemicals like 2C-B. Some use several in tandem, raising questions about the potential legality of multi-sacrament groups. “As far as I’m concerned, we would not ask the Catholic church to choose between the bread and the wine,” said Breau. At Singularism, the church focuses solely on mushrooms in ceremonies that can cost up to $1,400 per round. It isn’t unusual for participants to find closure with estranged family members or face ego death during a session, said Jensen. “Some of them are very euphoric and pleasant, and some of them are very understandably difficult and can be at times uncomfortable.” Jensen is hopeful that his church’s legal battle could expand protections for religious freedom beyond ayahuasca. But he’s also worried that Singularism’s progress could inadvertently harm others by inspiring them to pursue similar claims without taking proper safeguards. “I think some people will end up going to jail having tried to replicate our process,” said Jensen. “Will there be more practices getting recognition after this? Absolutely, but it won’t be without tremendous casualties as well.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The closures have prompted a backlash and have echoes of where the Reform-led council is planning to close five care homes and five day centres and move residents into the private sector. Mick Coppin, a regional organiser of the GMB union, said the Derbyshire plans put vital services and more than 200 jobs at risk. “These closures are nothing short of a betrayal of local people and staff,” Coppin said. “Derbyshire county council did not stand before the electorate last May pledging to shut care homes. “Care home residents, their families and dedicated care workers face huge anxiety about the future – just days before Christmas. It’s time for the county’s leadership to halt these disastrous plans and work with the community to explore alternatives to closure.” Linsey Farnsworth, the Labour MP for Amber Valley, last week at prime minister’s questions in the Commons, saying that families and staff were heartbroken and called for a rethink. Keir Starmer replied: “It is deeply concerning to hear about the closure of eight Derbyshire care homes by the Reform-led Derbyshire county council. It will be hugely concerning to residents and their families, while we are making £3.7bn of extra funding available to councils to fund social care.” Derbyshire county council said it had been in “intensive” but unsuccessful negotiations with a provider to take over the running of the eight homes as a going concern. Joss Barnes, a Reform councillor who is the cabinet member for adult care, said he was “devastated” by the failure of the negotiations. “I know this will be extremely upsetting news for all our residents and their families, as well as our hard-working care colleagues, especially coming at this time of year in the run-up to Christmas,” he said. “I’d like to thank everyone for their hard work, patience and persistence and I’d also like to say how incredibly sorry I am that this hasn’t worked out as we’d hoped and planned for. “We have done absolutely everything to progress the sale, but in the end it wasn’t possible. Due to commercial sensitivities, we’re not able to give any more details regarding negotiations.” He said the council would work to support residents to find new homes.

How did it become such a thing? It’s just something the young people of today are saying. Or shouting. It’s more than fashionable – it’s a plague. Six-seven has become the bane of school teachers everywhere. Because it’s maddening. Imagine telling your students to turn to page 67, only for all of them to shout “six-seven!” at you. Yes, but I should preface any explanation by saying: it’s a long story and it doesn’t matter. Fine. The phrase “six-seven”, in its modern sense, appears to originate with the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla’s 2024 track Doot Doot (6 7), in which it’s either a reference to police radio code, or 67th Street, or something else. But it really went viral when the song was repeatedly used to soundtrack video clips of the NBA basketball star LaMelo Ball, who is, as it happens, 6ft 7in. Trust me, you don’t. Somewhere along the line the phrase acquired an accompanying hand gesture: two upturned palms alternately rising and falling, like weighing scales. Nice try, but no. The phrase has become such a phenomenon in the US that it was the basis for last week’s episode, in which it sparks a moral panic. Apparently it has. Thus ends the story of six-seven. Not in the least. It’s a bit of meme slang that refers only to itself, advertising nothing beyond the average 13-year-old’s capacity for being annoying and a corresponding willingness to flog a dead horse.

Housing remains one of the most critical yet underfunded parts of the national response to abuse. Without a secure home, survivors cannot rebuild their lives, access work or engage with support services. Every week, too many women and families seeking help are turned away because there simply isn’t enough safe, suitable housing available. A survivor can’t start again if they have nowhere to go. associations are uniquely placed to bridge that gap – combining safe accommodation with specialist, trauma-informed support that helps people rebuild confidence and independence. While the government’s emphasis on prevention and early intervention is welcomed, this must be backed by long-term funding for housing-based solutions that recognise the complexity of people’s lives, including women with multiple needs, male survivors, children, disabled people, and minority communities, who often face the highest barriers to safety. The strategy’s focus on early education and cultural change is encouraging, but housing must sit at the centre of this system of protection. Local authorities and registered providers are often the first point of contact for people at risk, and they need the resources to respond swiftly and safely.

They have the economic wherewithal to buy what they want, when they want, so the sense of special occasion, and gratitude, is lost. However, I’d counter that the reason many people have stopped buying presents for partners is precisely because they do appreciate how lucky they are, and see no need for the performative gift-buying for a person who needs, or wants, very little. Deciding not to add to your possessions for the sake of it isn’t ungrateful, and certainly doesn’t preclude giving gifts to others that are needed, wanted and appreciated. I love the undiluted delight on the face of a person who’s just received the perfect gift, however small. I also know that at 55, with a steady income and an established home, there’s very little practical stuff I need, and relatively few affordable treats I can’t afford at intervals through the year. Yes, that means I’m more fortunate than many others, but it doesn’t mean I’m unaware of that fact. I still love to get presents for others, and still love to receive gifts – but if someone said to me they didn’t want anything, I wouldn’t assume they were unaware of the people who do wait for and birthdays for the things they need. I’d also point out that very often, the people who say they’re not doing gifts follow that up with, “Instead, we’re donating to…”, thereby contributing towards supporting those who really do need the things we may take for granted at Christmas. I can think of lots of reasons people might not “do” presents this year, and not one is because a person already has “Seventeen [candles] already, none ever lit”. They may think Christmas has become far too commercialised. They may have less disposable money than other people think. They may say it to spare other people the embarrassment of having to reciprocate with presents they can’t afford. They may be secretly donating to food banks and charities instead.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/20/dwp-misleading-response-carers-allowance-scandal,Pressure grows on DWP over ‘misleading’ response to carer’s allowance scandal,2025-12-20T17:00:34.000Z,"Senior officials face criticism after review found systemic failings plunged hundreds of thousands of unpaid carers into debt Senior officials who oversaw a flawed benefits system that plunged hundreds of thousands of carers into debt are under mounting pressure over their “misleading” response to the scandal. Liz Sayce, the chair of a into the government’s treatment of unpaid carers, last week called for an overhaul of management and culture at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Days after the publication of the review, the DWP’s top civil servant in charge of carers’ allowance, Neil Couling, said His comments, revealed by the Guardian, have prompted a key adviser to the Sayce review and a leading carer’s charity to declare a lack of confidence in the department’s pledge to fix the issues. Prof Sue Yeandle, the UK’s leading expert on unpaid carers, said ministers and senior officials had issued “really misleading” claims that the failures affected only a small number of people. Helen Walker, the chief executive of UK, said: “This is not a small number of people. Its scale and the devastation caused to so many families cannot be over-estimated, as was laid bare in Liz Sayce’s report. Any suggestion that this is anything other than a systemic failure over a number of years is unacceptable.” Yeandle, who sat on the advisory panel for the government-commissioned Sayce review, said that while ministers initially claimed to have accepted “the vast majority” of the report’s 40 recommendations, 13 had been only partially accepted and two were rejected. “Sayce calls for swift action on longstanding issues, some of which the DWP should have resolved long ago,” Yeandle said, adding that she was speaking in a personal capacity. She said: “The official response and internal DWP memo published last weekend don’t give me much confidence that senior officials will now address these with the urgency and commitment needed.” the systemic failings after a Guardian investigation exposed how scores of vulnerable families had been left with huge debts and hundreds with criminal convictions for fraud. Peter Schofield, the DWP’s most senior civil servant, is facing scrutiny for in effect overseeing the crisis despite promising MPs in 2019 that it would be fixed. He told MPs on the public accounts committee earlier this month: “I am sorry for all of those who are affected by this, but I am going to sort it out.” Those who care for loved ones for at least 35 hours a week are entitled to £83.30 a week in carer’s allowance, provided their weekly earnings do not exceed £196. But if carers exceed this limit, even by as little as 1p, they must repay the entire week’s allowance. The draconian nature of the rules is compounded by the DWP’s failure to alert unpaid carers when they have overstepped the earnings limit, despite the department having access to near real-time data. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people – sometimes of more than £20,000 – which the DWP often seeks to recover years later, threatening carers with criminal prosecution if they do not pay. Ministers last month pledged about £75m to fix the scandal and ordered about 200,000 historical cases to be reassessed. The DWP says about 26,000 carers are likely to have debts cancelled or reduced, although experts believe this figure should be far higher. Yeandle said the failures had put vulnerable families under “intolerable strain”. She said: “To rebuild trust, government and the DWP should issue an unreserved apology for this. It’s left a terrible enduring legacy for some carers, and in these cases I think government should consider compensation. Some debts built up over long periods, with carers not made aware of this by the DWP until years had passed.” Yeandle, the former director of the Centre for Care at the University of Sheffield, said the government’s initial response to the Sayce review “looked promising”, but she had lost confidence in the department’s commitment following the Couling controversy and its refusal to fully accept several key recommendations. One recommendation only partially accepted by the DWP was to issue clearer guidance on what expenses carers can be allowed under the rules. Katy Styles, of We Care Campaign, said she believed Couling should resign and said it was difficult to have confidence in Schofield, the DWP’s permanent secretary. “Systemic failings aren’t abstract policy problems,” she said. “They translate into stress and financial insecurity. It’s a constant battle to be believed by a department that holds immense power over people’s lives.” The DWP’s response to the failings was crucial, she said, because for carers it was about “really being listened to and protected from further failure”. She added: “Ministers need to ask whether a culture that has repeatedly minimised these concerns can change itself, or whether clear political leadership is required to impose the cultural and leadership change that the victims of this scandal so deserve.” Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuennsberg programme earlier this month that Couling’s comments were “not the position” of the DWP and said the carer’s allowance issue was a”longstanding problem that was ignored by the previous government”. A DWP spokesperson said: “We inherited a system that let carers down – but we’re taking decisive action to put things right and rebuild trust, accepting the vast majority of the Sayce’s review recommendations. “We’re already making changes, hiring extra staff to stop carers building up large debts, updating internal guidance, and making sure letters clearly explain what changes carers need to report. “And we will continue putting things right by reassessing affected cases, and potentially reducing, cancelling or refunding debts for tens of thousands of carers, as well as working to modernise the benefit so this doesn’t happen again.”",Josh Halliday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/stamp-duty-britain-housing-crisis-property-tax-economists,Abolishing stamp duty won’t solve Britain’s housing crisis – but this radical property tax just might,2025-10-15T11:21:38.000Z,"Economists on all sides agree: rather than incremental changes, this deeply unfair market needs a ‘big bang’ moment Josh Ryan-Collins is professor of economics and finance at the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose he UK’s property tax system is both inefficient and unfair. There is consensus among all political parties that something needs to be done. On the efficiency side, stamp duty is the main culprit: as a lump sum tax on property wealth paid at point of purchase, it discourages people to move as frequently as they should. It prevents people from realising their full economic potential by finding the right job, in the right area, or moving into a home suitable for their household size. In combination with high interest rates and sluggish growth, tax is contributing to UK property transactions reaching as “under-occupied”, with two or more spare bedrooms; . Reforming stamp duty to free up some of these under-occupied properties – mainly concentrated in the baby-boomer generation now hitting retirement – could enhance growth, productivity and, potentially, the affordability crisis. I say “potentially” because it is well established that cuts to property taxes – and in turn, house prices. Apparently oblivious to this fact, both the Conservatives and Reform have proposed major cuts to the overall burden of property taxation. Kemi Badenoch has on primary residences. Reform UK has proposed smaller reductions in stamp duty but added in cuts to inheritance tax and the restoration of some landlord tax reliefs. as a financial asset, and thus prices. Such reforms will most benefit those in London and the south-east with the most expensive homes and those who tend to move more often, while higher prices will largely cancel out the benefits for first-time buyers, just as did under the Conservatives. Rising prices will also weaken the incentives for empty-nesters to downsize. On the fairness side, council tax has become essentially a wealth tax on low- and middle-income earners. A tax based partly on locally provided public services and partly on property value, it is “band-based”, with those in higher bands paying more. The bands were introduced in 1991 and politicians have opted never to revalue them since then, despite house prices in certain areas of the country increasing sevenfold. As a result, households in the bottom 10% of property values pay, of their property value annually, while those in the top 10% pay less than 0.1%. A multimillion pound mansion in Westminster can incur less tax than a modest home in the north of England. The property tax system also favours homeowners over renters and investment in property over other financial assets. Few people know it, but until 1963 there was a tax imposed on homeowners based on the rent they would have been paying had they been renting their homes: so called imputed rent, a tax still imposed in the Netherlands. Most importantly, given the explosive rise in house prices since the 1980s, homeowners enjoy 100% relief on capital gains tax on selling their primary residence. At , this was the single largest tax relief in the country, equivalent to 1.15% of GDP, roughly the equivalent to running the Home Office and Ministry of Justice combined. All of these flaws combine to and lending in the UK towards property, rather than capital investment or equity in businesses. This is a major but largely neglected reason for the as well as the affordability crisis. Effective property tax reform requires an approach that represses investment demand and overconsumption of UK housing and frees up the stock for those who really need it. Among economists of both the left and right, there is increasing consensus that the UK needs a “big bang” rather than incremental reform. Replacing stamp duty and reforming council tax with an annual (PPT) of around 0.5% on the market value of the home – or the value of the land underneath it – would deal with both the inefficiency and unfairness challenges within the existing system. Research by the shows it would benefit three quarters of the population, not least the “red wall” seats that Labour is haemorrhaging to Reform. Complications arise because council tax is also a vital source of funding for local public services; poorer areas could end up needing huge transfers from central government, resulting in even more fiscal centralisation. A by ex-government adviser Tim Leunig argued for councils to control the funds from a PPT on homes under £500,000, setting their own rate and with a minimum payment of £800, while central government would take funds from properties above this value at a 0.5% rate, with a 0.8% rate for homes above £1m. Rumours circulated that the Treasury was . The political risks would be high given the media is mostly hostile to any new tax on property. Labour needs to be bold and make the positive case for shifting the burden of tax off working peopleand on to unearned wealth. A radical reform of property taxation could help deliver three of its key policy goals: reducing rising wealth and regional inequalities, solving the housing crisis and stimulating economic growth.

New research from Queen’s University Belfast reveals how the wellbeing of carers and patients is intertwined Progress in preventing, detecting and treating cancer means that survival rates have doubled in the UK in the past 50 years. But the impact on those caring for someone with the disease can still be significant. Research by academics at Queen’s University Belfast has found that the psychological, physical, social and financial impacts of cancer on informal caregivers, from spouses or partners to adolescents, can be serious. With 1.1 million working adults providing daily support to a loved one with cancer, according to , more attention needs to be paid to caregivers, they say. In addition, caregivers may face extra psychological pressure from challenges such as helping cancer survivors tackle discrimination when they are trying to access financial services, including loans, mortgages, health and travel insurance, according to a recent Queen’s study. Research published last year found that on average, up to 25% of those living beyond their cancer in Europe are unable to access and benefit from appropriate financial services because they have to declare their previous cancer diagnosis despite being cured. “Make no mistake – this is financial discrimination against cancer survivors,” says , professor of digital health at . “I know people who are 17 years post their treatment and they are still having issues. Imagine if adolescents are looking after their parents and then they also have to deal with this financial aspect. There is enough stress for them.” Lawler is campaigning for a UK-wide initiative to address this inequity, called the Right To Be Forgotten. “The idea is that five years post treatment you are cured so you shouldn’t have to declare your previous cancer diagnosis to a bank, a mortgage agency, an insurance company, or similar. And they shouldn’t be able to ask you.” . “Our work has demonstrated that if someone is diagnosed with cancer, it’s not only the patient who is affected. If you care for someone with cancer, your health can also suffer,” says , a reader in supportive cancer care at “Carers’ and patients’ health are related. If we want to improve outcomes for patients, it’s really important to also take care of the caregiver,” she says. Her team launched as a forum for advice that is easy to access – and digest. “Carers had told us that sometimes trying to navigate through written material was really tricky. Plus your eye often runs down to the bad news on a leaflet. With videos you can receive the right information at the right point.” Despite improved detection rates, cancer is still a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly , or nearly one in six, and cases are increasing. Figures from the suggest there will be more than 35m new cancer cases in 2050, a 77% increase from an estimated 20m in 2022. . His work focuses on trying to of those with cancer and those who care for them, which mostly encompasses family members. “Carers [in this context] is a tricky term because people don’t often see themselves as caregivers; they just see themselves as providing support,” he says. When a carer is anxious, that generates anxiety in the person who has cancer, his research has found. “The two things are connected, because their psychological wellbeing is intertwined. So if the carer feels their life is miserable, and they’re not enjoying life, that will actually have a more negative impact on the person with cancer,” he says. Oesophageal cancer, which mainly affects men over 60 or 65 years of age, is less well understood than breast or prostate cancer, so it makes people more anxious. It can be particularly hard to cope with the after-effects of removing a tumour from the oesophagus, which include difficulty eating, he says. “Carers are usually wives. Our research showed they experienced higher levels of anxiety than the patients. Because they aren’t the ones feeling the symptoms, they are forever being vigilant about symptoms and worrying about the patient. The patient knows when things are getting worse and the carer doesn’t,” he says. Dempster advocates an intervention called acceptance and commitment therapy, which helps people accept difficult feelings and commit to actions that are meaningful. “It’s about encouraging carers to give themselves permission to do something like meeting friends for a coffee, if that is something they value” he says. Separate research into the impact on adolescents when a parent has cancer found they are often lonely and dealing with overwhelming emotions on their own. In research conducted by one of Dempster’s PhD students, Lydia McKeown, a young person told her: “I don’t have anyone to share with, so it affects my emotional stability a lot.” Dempster suggests that if someone has teenage children who are the main carers “there needs to be an investigation into their psychological wellbeing and their loneliness, and how it can be resolved and managed”. Creating peer groups for adolescents to meet teenagers in the same situation can be helpful. One teenager who joined such a group told McKeown: “I met a group of kids who had either a mum or dad who was suffering from cancer, so those were the persons I felt comfortable talking about this whole situation with.” With cancer rates still increasing – showed nearly 950 people a day got a diagnosis in England in 2022 – it is clear that more attention needs to be paid to the invisible army supporting them through their illness.",Susie Mesure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/26/arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungi-living-library-vital-ecosystem-engineers,Defunding fungi: US’s living library of ‘vital ecosystem engineers’ is in danger of closing,2025-12-26T17:00:14.000Z,"These fungi boost plant growth and restore depleted ecosystems, but federal funding for a library housing them has been cut – and it may be forced to close nside a large greenhouse at the University of , Professor Liz Koziol and Dr Terra Lubin tend rows of sudan grass in individual plastic pots. The roots of each straggly plant harbor a specific strain of invisible soil fungus. The shelves of a nearby cold room are stacked high with thousands of plastic bags and vials containing fungal spores harvested from these plants, then carefully preserved by the researchers. The samples in this seemingly unremarkable room are part of the International Collection of Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (INVAM), the world’s largest living library of soil fungi. Four decades in the making, it could cease to exist within a year due to federal budget cuts. For leading mycologist Toby Kiers, this would be catastrophic. “INVAM represents a library of hundreds of millions of years of evolution,” said Kiers, executive director of the Society for Protection of Underground Networks ( ). “Ending INVAM for scientists is like closing the Louvre for artists.” The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi conserved by INVAM are symbiotic organisms that support the growth of 70% of land plant species across all ecosystems. In exchange for sugars and fats, they provide plants with vital nutrients – phosphorus, nitrogen, trace metals – and buffer them against drought, disease and other stressors. They also represent a substantial INVAM maintains living spores of more than 900 distinct fungal strains collected from six continents. It’s an irreplaceable hub for mycological research worldwide – but these fungi also have practical power: restoring degraded ecosystems, rebuilding damaged soils and slashing artificial fertilizer use. They are essential tools for growing food and undoing the environmental harm caused by agriculture. Established in 1985, INVAM has relied on successive federal grants for its entire existence. Its latest US National Science Foundation (NSF) funding ended in May. As curator and professor Jim Bever and team prepare a new funding proposal, the outlook is ominous: the Trump administration’s would slash NSF funding by 57% and make it even more difficult to win the remaining funds. Without another grant, Bever estimates the collection can limp along for perhaps another year. Beyond that, INVAM could be forced to close. “I have a hard time thinking about that possibility,” Bever said, “but we can’t deny it’s true.” For now, INVAM is surviving on temporary research grants and volunteer labor. Unlike the collection’s previous home at West Virginia University, which provided institutional support for personnel, the University of Kansas covers infrastructure and overhead costs but not staffing. Unlike seeds stored in vaults or cells frozen indefinitely, without sustained, meticulous work, the spores of AM fungi die. At INVAM, associate curator Lubin works at a microscope to isolate and identify AM spores from intact soils. Seen through the microscope, these spores are visually stunning: glistening orbs, packed with nutrients needed to support young fungi. Lubin then paints isolated spores on to the roots of a sudan grass seedling. These host plants will grow in a sterile greenhouse for 12 weeks while fungi colonize their roots and soil. Then the plants will be water-starved, prompting the fungus to produce millions of spores, which workers harvest and store in the adjoining cold room. For every one of INVAM’s 900-plus strains, this process must be repeated annually. “The isolation and maintenance of AM fungi requires an arcane skillset,” said Bever. “There really isn’t another lab in the US that has been doing this.” INVAM prepares small batches of AM fungal spores to distribute or sell to other researchers and land managers. But Bever is clear this isn’t a commercial operation, and INVAM has neither the capacity nor the ambition to scale up production. That matters because the commercial AM fungus market is rife with problems. , Bever and colleagues tested 23 products marketed as fungal biofertilizers – AM spores alleged to boost plant growth naturally. Eighty-seven per cent failed to colonize plant roots. Many contained only dead spores or no spores at all. Some products contained known plant pathogens. A large-scale by European researchers revealed similar failings. Bever and Koziol’s of global research reached the same disturbing conclusion: the majority of commercial AM fertilizers are worthless. “Unfortunately, the quality of most products available to farmers or restoration practitioners is really just terrible,” said Bever. Yet land managers are buying them. The global market for fungal biofertilizers is . Most of that money is being wasted on products that simply do not work. Bever sees two key problems: the industry lacks regulation, and most producers lack the specialized expertise needed to steward and distribute these delicate organisms effectively. Meanwhile, the public research infrastructure that could provide real solutions struggles to survive. The failure of most commercial biofertilizers stands in stark contrast to research demonstrating what these organisms can actually achieve. At a field research plot near INVAM’s base in Lawrence, Kansas, the impact of invisible fungi is obvious. Nine years ago, this was a tired old hay field, dominated by invasive grass. Today it is a riot of color and diversity. Twelve-foot prairie docks tower over head-tall grasses; grasshoppers leap and butterflies flit between late blooming flowers, even in October. This small patch has become a reincarnation of the tall-grass prairie that once dominated the central US states. It was this ecosystem that built the deep, fertile soils that made this area such a prime target for conversion to farmland – a shift that has diminished the prairie to a mere AM fungi drove the transformation. In 2016, INVAM curator Koziol seeded plots with dozens of native prairie plants, plus AM spores from surviving old-growth prairie fragments. Control plots received the seeds but not the fungi. As a result, dozens of plants in the control plots failed to establish and all plants grew slowly. Nine years on, the difference between control and AM-treated plots is still clear. Modern agriculture decimates AM fungi – which is why reintroducing them can deliver such dramatic results. Fungicides used to control plant diseases seep into soils, killing AM fungi. Excessive synthetic fertilizer application causes plants to break symbiotic ties, starving fungi. Ploughing destroys their underground networks. As a result, AM fungi often vanish entirely from cultivated land, “We can barely even find the DNA [of AM fungi] in some of the soils that have been in intensive agricultural production,” said leading fungal ecologist Matthias Rillig of Freie Universität Berlin. This matters because AM fungi disperse slowly – they produce no above-ground fruiting bodies to scatter spores on the wind. As a result, reintroduction is often essential for restoration. Building on their successful prairie restoration experiments, Bever and Koziol see potential for AM fungi in establishing – patches of deep-rooted, species-rich perennial plants within existing farm fields that boost pollinators and limit fertilizer runoff, which contaminates groundwater and creates dead zones in bodies of water. “Prairie strips are awesome,” said Bever, but he believes there’s grander potential in the Conservation Reserve Program. This federal scheme has already enlisted , supporting landowners to transition marginal farmland into native grassland and woodland to improve soil health, retain water and store carbon. “The return on that investment would be much greater if there was a national policy to reinoculate with native mycorrhizal fungi,” he said. Beyond habitat restoration, and despite the current failure of most commercial fungal biofertilizers, AM fungi can be useful in mainstream agriculture. In 2016, Koziol founded to produce high-quality preparations of old-growth prairie fungus spores. In addition to restoration practitioners, customers report promising results in vineyards, orange orchards, and high-value organic crops such as The effects of AM fungi are likely to be strongest in perennial crops, including new grains like , whose roots remain in the ground long enough for stable symbiosis to establish. But evidence shows AM fungi can also boost growth of annual staples “The benefits of mycorrhizal fungi are real,” said Bever. Yet scientists are only beginning to understand how these organisms work. Numerous research questions about AM fungi can only be answered with living libraries such as INVAM, Bever added. Why do AM fungal cells contain thousands of nuclei, for instance, when ours need just one? And how can apparently distinct species merge their cells to create hybrids? “Research on mycorrhizal fungi is totally dependent on having these fungi in culture,” Bever said. “The current administration has shifted funding away from basic science,” he added, “and while there is always a hope that private donors could fill that void, I don’t think there is a real substitute for federal investment.” Kiers, now a professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, described how visiting INVAM in the 1990s to identify spores collected from Panama’s hyper-diverse rainforests shaped her entire career: “After seeing the collection, I was hooked. It changed the way I saw the underground. “To have any hope in leveraging fungi for future climate change strategies, restoration efforts and regenerative agriculture, we need to safeguard this collection,” Kiers said. Merlin Sheldrake, mycologist and author of Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures, agreed emphatically. “These organisms are vital ecosystem engineers that hold the key to so many problems we face,” he said. “To lose this library would be an unimaginable tragedy.”",Ben Martynoga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

House especially likes the sky frame that comes with the kit: “You hold it up to the clouds and it helps you focus on what light is available.” Sunset is expected at 3.30pm on the day that Erika Copland, a community link practitioner with Orkney GPs, speaks to the Guardian. While the Orkney Islands enjoy extended daylight during the summer months, winter brings grey, wet and miserable weather, she says. “It’s that feeling of being enveloped by the darkness, especially when the rain is battering against the window. You don’t feel like going out, and it does bring your mood down.” There’s a waiting list for the boxes, which are also available in more remote areas from the mobile library van, known locally as Booky McBookface. “The way things work in Orkney is very much word of mouth, so we’re hoping more people will hear about it and be better able to cope through the winter,” says Copland. The development of the Wintering Well boxes is part of a UKRI-funded research project, Living with Sad, led by Prof Hester Parr of the University of Glasgow. It follows a successful pilot further south in East Dunbartonshire libraries last year. Feedback from those box borrowers was effusive – people felt more able to start their days thanks to the kit, and more than half changed their daily routines to include walking in daylight hours and spent more time noticing seasonal changes in nature and in the sky above them. Staff noted that Winter Well users also got excited about other library facilities. Sad is a historically contested condition, says Parr. It was given its own diagnostic category in 1987, which was later removed, with a continuing critical discussion about whether it exists on its own or as a subset of depression. Beyond this, however, there is a clear social recognition of how winter light affects individuals, she says. “The public absolutely understand this experience and recognise what it means: that we are all of us, obviously, affected by light.” The light boxes are designed specifically so that people are “not just passively receiving light but creatively engaging with it”, adds Parr, arguing that coping with Sad “depends on the attitude that comes with the latitude”. “People in Scandinavian countries tend to have different attitudes towards winter because they’ve had to, embracing winter light and embracing their relationship with the season.” Ultimately Parr would like to see these boxes of light in every public library, given how these buildings can be important health and wellbeing hubs, particularly in rural areas. “We plan to take over the world,” she says brightly.",Libby Brooks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From reconstructing ancient climates to tackling today’s ecological threats, researchers at the university are showing how shared curiosity can help shape policy in the now The interdisciplinary approach at Queen’s University Belfast has helped it attract some of the finest minds to fight critical climate and environmental threats. . He fell into palaeoecology, the ecology of subfossil animals and plants, almost by accident. As a boy, he wanted to be an ice-cream seller but just one afternoon in the job convinced him it was not for him. Then he thought of becoming a doctor, but realised blood made him faint, so he set aside that ambition too. He studied biology, took a job in palaeoecology, and joined Queen’s University Belfast 18 years ago. He’s now a globally respected expert, professor at the School of Natural and Built Environment and director of the . “It’s a really, really nice job,” he says. “It’s very diverse – there’s archaeology, there’s Earth sciences, there’s forensics, carbon burial and carbon sequestration.” is with peat bogs. “They’re fascinating systems because there’s hardly any decomposition,” he says. “So you can just take a core, which lets you go down in time for several millennia, 8,000 years or so, sometimes 13,000 years.” He describes his exploration of peat bogs with infectious enthusiasm. “You get all wet and dirty and it’s muddy, but it’s full of insects, birds, spiders – occasionally angry farmers as well,” he says. Last month he was doing fieldwork in a Danish bog where multiple human bodies were found in the 1940s. He wasn’t there to find more bodies, but to reconstruct what the environment and local conditions looked like when those bodies were deposited. Blaauw’s work has enjoyed universal impact – quite literally. Some of the software he developed as part of his research practice has been used on Mars to analyse a sediment system on the red planet. One of his programs is stored at the , a secure backup facility for the world’s crop diversity. “So if something happens and the internet does indeed crash or something, then the software code is still available there,” he says. He says life is “very, very multidisciplinary” at Queen’s, which is important because “archaeology by its very nature borrows from many, many different disciplines”. As he works, he can call on colleagues with expertise in politics, as well as historians, physicists, chemists, biologists and human geographers. Working together, they are able to extend their influence. “Northern Ireland is a pretty small place, so there’s not that much distance between us in the universities and the politicians,” he says. “And it’s not that difficult to actually get to speak to someone who has some degree of influence.” Blaauw has also had a hand in the production of the , which are used to correct radiocarbon ages for changes over time so that chronologies are comparable worldwide.

A global expert on both locally and worldwide, next year he’s off to New Zealand to advise on how to deal with the Asian clam, which has invaded the country’s rivers. He’s also advised South Africa on how to deal with a variety of invaders, such as the Largemouth bass. “The Largemouth bass was introduced to the Sundays River System in South Africa and has been considered invasive,” says Dick. “There are huge political, social and legal debates that are ongoing in the area to discuss how best to deal with this invasive species.” He adds: “A lot of the papers that we’ve published have been picked up across the world and our methods have been emulated and copied. We’ve become a centre of excellence for dealing with invasive species globally, not just at the local level.” He too enjoys the “interdisciplinary” nature of Queen’s where he’s “brushing shoulders with an engineer one minute and a food chemist the next”. He compares this diversity to evolution itself. “Natural selection works on variation, leading to adaptation, so if you allow variation, you allow adaptation,” he says. “That diversity is absolutely key and Queen’s has been good at it.” “Too many academics go down rabbit holes,” he says, “but when you’re seeing the issue from multiple directions and you can speak to someone on a subject that you know little about, you can start to see the bigger picture and that excites you.” This brings an agility to the university’s team, he says, and his energy personifies this. “We’ve unified a subject area with a common method that nobody had picked up until we did that at Queen’s – and now it’s a global movement to use our methodology,” he says. was once one of Dick’s students. He’s now a lecturer and an expert in a number of interlinked fields, particularly , climate change and disease vector biology. The arrival of invasive species is like a lottery, he says, with some species succeeding and others failing following introduction through human trade and transport networks, noting the recent detection and rapid removal of Asian hornets in Northern Ireland. “The issue matters because invasive species are one of the major drivers of biodiversity decline and they’ve caused or been linked in part to the majority of extinction events around the world,” he says. “The effects are quite substantial, both ecologically and economically, with their costs reaching trillions of pounds.” “Queen’s really provides an ideal environment to work in those areas because you can bring together lots of different expertise and there are a lot of academics working in different spaces,” he says. This strong interdisciplinary ethos is perfect for complex problems like invasive species, he says. “They have social aspects because they’re a human issue, they have environmental aspects because of their impacts, as well as health aspects and more.”",Chas Newkey-Burden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world’s food sector is a huge contributor to global heating, emitting about created by human activities. But at the same time there is a crisis in food availability as undernutrition and dietary deficiencies coexist with obesity and excessive consumption. Creating a rational food system that minimises environmental damage while providing a healthy diet for all requires a coordinated approach, says , an expert in nutrition and preventive medicine who is co-director of the and director of inter-disciplinary research at the , at Queen’s University Belfast. “Food production, what we eat, and the environment are all very closely interconnected, and they are key for optimising human health. So how do we transition to a healthy diet from sustainable food systems?” she asks. Reducing the environmental impact of food production is a fraught issue. The – a significant contributor to global heating – highlights the potential for controversy. Feeding the world in a sustainable way that is acceptable to the public requires wide-ranging policymaking that draws from environmental research, nutritional analysis and agricultural innovation. Public information and education are also vital. There is a growing understanding of the need for a holistic approach linking all these factors together. The school of biological sciences at Queen’s University Belfast and the Institute for Global Food Security conduct research across the chain of food production from soil to fork. Their cross-disciplinary work analyses ways to improve soil health, planetary health and public health. Cassidy sums up the challenge: “How can we become more resilient and sustainable, given the problems of nutrition and safety that we have in the food system?” she says, concluding that more centralised global governance is necessary. “There needs to be multi-stakeholder involvement to make it really clear how we can change the food system,” she says. Cassidy’s nutritional research has looked at the impact of diet on health conditions such as diabetes and dementia. led by Cassidy shows that consuming food and drink rich in natural compounds known as flavonoids significantly reduces the risks of dementia. found that a plant-based diet high in fruit, vegetables and wholegrains greatly reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with a plant-based diet high in refined grains, snack foods and desserts. Reflecting the university’s integrated approach, its biology and agriculture departments also conduct extensive analysis of soil health and dairy, beef and lamb production. , who is a professor in animal science and microbiology, and interim director of the school of biological sciences and the Institute for Global Food Security, has led several significant studies. One of the latest involves from sheep, beef and dairy animals by adding locally sourced seaweed to cattle feed. Researchers are also studying the nutritional value of a variety of seaweeds and their effects on meat quality. “We’ve shown that feeding cattle some of our local seaweeds enhances the iodine level in milk substantially and reduces methane a little,” says Huws. But she adds that the greatest impact is from adding red seaweed known as asparagopsis to cattle feed, which can reduce emissions by up to 80%. “It is the most substantial methane reduction that we’ve ever seen with any dietary intervention we’ve tried,” she says. Huws commented widely in the media on the Bovaer controversy in December, pointing out that 150 studies have shown that no trace of the chemical additive is found in any milk produced by cows who have been fed it, so it poses no risk to humans. As part of its work analysing issues concerned with food production and distribution, the Institute of Global Food Security has conducted in sustainable agriculture. Not only does healthy soil act as a carbon sink locking in greenhouse gases, but it also promotes biodiversity. Regenerative farming, which prioritises soil health through promoting biodiversity and reducing tillage and disturbance of the soil, will be vital in addressing the many challenges of sustainable food production. “Regenerative farming is going to be part of any future solution,” Huws says. She adds that the university’s food research is geared mainly towards innovation and working closely with stakeholders, including the food industry, government and farmers on the ground. The biological sciences department and the Institute for Global Food Security have a vital role in creating a multidisciplinary approach to human, planetary and food health, she believes. “For many years, science has been siloed, looking at one problem at a time,” she says. “And that’s not a good approach, because the consequences of that on other factors are never investigated. “At Queen’s University Belfast, we look at ways that we can enhance the sustainability of the food production system with the environment and human health in mind. We take a holistic, system-based view.” Creating productive, environmentally sustainable methods of food cultivation and production will be critical to tackling the double challenge of promoting human and planetary health. “Our job is to provide the tools to make that happen,” says Huws. “We are involved in a lot of innovation and my message is positive – the future looks good.”",David Benady,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/25/nosy-researchers-quest-to-map-the-worlds-smellscapes,Nosy researcher’s quest to map the world’s ‘smellscapes’,2025-12-25T17:00:45.000Z,"We can share images and sounds, so why not smells? Dr Kate McLean-MacKenzie hopes her new atlas will make scents hristmas may be associated with the aromas of oranges and mince pies but our towns and cities also boast special scents during the rest of the year. Now, one researcher is publishing an atlas attempting to capture these quirky “smellscapes”. Dr Kate McLean-MacKenzie, a designer and researcher at the University of Kent, said she first became intrigued by the sense of smell 15 years ago. “I realised that there was an enormous gap in the fact that we communicate what we see – and we can record that and we can share it via Instagram and photography and sketching – and we can record and share sounds digitally. But any way of recording and communicating smell was largely missing,” she said. As a result, McLean-MacKenzie began mapping “smellscapes” in different locations, including many of the world’s cities. This involves asking participants to take “smell walks” on the street – recording not only what they can smell but its intensity and duration, whether it is unexpected, whether they like it or not, and any associations the scent conjures up. “I analyse that data and from it create visual maps and then a sort of cultural narrative about what smell tells you about those cities in response to what came out from the smell walks,” McLean-MacKenzie said. “So it’s all human interpretation, it’s largely subjective, and it’s about the stories that smells lead us to in cities.” Among the cities that have been mapped since 2011 are Glasgow, Edinburgh, Canterbury, Amsterdam, Verona, Kyiv, Kolkata and Paris, with the atlas covering 40 locations. has long been derided, recent research has shown it is not to be sniffed at: among other studies, scientists have found people can tell apart smells that arise just McLean-MacKenzie said the goal of the smell walks was not to identify a scent per se. “It’s about naming it and therefore giving those smells meaning in people’s lives.” Among the examples, McLean-MacKenzie said one participant called a particular waft “the smell of shattered dreams”. “That was somebody in New York who basically said … the smell of shattered dreams is the smell of stale beer on the sidewalk, walking home late at night, single still,” she said. The maps, she added, capture the ephemeral nature of smells, showing the source of the odour on the day the smell walk took place, and where the scent may be blown. “It’s like an impressionist painting of light. It’s a moment in time and the only way that you’ll get to experience it is by going out and smelling for yourself,” she said. McLean-MacKenzie said the maps could become a useful historical record of how cities smell now, because future generations may have different experiences – as electric vehicles proliferate, for example. She hopes the atlas will encourage readers to engage with all their senses when out walking, and in a physical as well as a digital way. “By engaging with how other people smell spaces in ways that you might not, there’s a level of acceptance, tolerance and understanding of the fact that as individuals we are all very different and we do see things in different ways,” she added. McLean-MacKenzie said even festival-related scents could depend on where in the world someone is. “We can say [the] smells of Christmas are mince pies and Christmas pudding and turkey and fires and all the rest of it,” she said. “But in Kolkata they’re not, they’re smells of Chhena cake and lights and different things happening and different drinks and foods around. And the smell of cold for them is 20C, whereas for us it’s sub-zero.” Smells can even bring surprises: McLean-MacKenzie said that when a participant who recorded smells in Antarctica came across a dead seal, they found it had a pleasant, leather-like odour. “Just because something smells doesn’t mean it’s bad, and it’s only there temporarily,” she said. “So get over yourself and go and have a whiff and see what it’s like.”",Nicola Davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though he faced heavy criticism at the time, Fishacre would probably have been delighted to learn that very similar principles are being used to make discoveries today. During his lifetime it was believed that Earth was made up of four elements – fire, water, earth and air – while the stars and other planets were made from a special transparent and unchanging fifth element. to argue that if stars and planets were made of a such a substance, they would appear transparent. Instead, the red of Mars, yellow of Venus and blue and white of the moon, he said, were clear evidence that they were made up of multiple elements also found on Earth.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/23/pink-platypus-spotted-in-gippsland-victoria,Pink platypus spotted in Gippsland far from a monochrome monotreme,2025-12-22T23:11:57.000Z,"Biologist says specimen filmed by a Victorian fisher is ‘unusual’, but not a rare albino as some had wondered Cody Stylianou thought he saw a huge trout. But, skimming just below the surface, it was moving differently than a fish would. The creature surfaced and, amazed, the Victorian fisher reached for his phone. Swimming in front of him was a pink platypus. Stylianou regularly fishes in the Gippsland spot, which he is keeping secret to protect the rare animal. He thinks it could be the same one he saw years ago, just older and bigger. “The bill and feet are super obviously pink,” he says. “When he did go a bit further into sunlit areas, he was easy to follow underwater, which is how I got so many videos of him surfacing.” Stylianou had been on his first trout fishing trip of the season in September when he saw the platypus, which he has nicknamed “Pinky”. He watched it feed at the top of the tannin-stained river for about 15 minutes. “I’ve seen other platypus in the same river system, just regular coloured ones,” he says. “Probably about five to eight of them over the years, from memory. Normally, they just pop up at the top of the water and then disappear once they see me.” After Stylinaou shared footage of the monotreme, commenters online speculated that it could have been a rare albino platypus. But the biologist Jeff Williams says it is just lighter in colour than what most would expect. “Platypus do vary a lot in colour,” the director of the Australian Platypus Conservancy says. “And this one’s at the extreme end of the light ones. It’s not one that we consider should be added to the list of albino and leucistic ones.” Just as humans have different coloured hair or skin pigment, platypus also come in different variations, Williams says. He said the platypus captured on video was “unusual but not exceptional”. “What I’ve seen and what every other leading platypus person has looked at, it says, is that it’s well within the sort of variation in colour that one would expect,” he says. “Let’s put it this way, it’s cute, but it’s not a breakthrough … We think this is just one of the extreme ends. Every so often, you will get a genetic anomaly that just throws up things, just as it does with some humans, who have more freckles and so on. “It’s somewhat unusual, but it’s nothing to get particularly excited about, we’re afraid.” The platypus is listed as near-threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There has also been a , making them more vulnerable, Williams says. “Platypus were in significant decline up until about the 1990s when all the impact of European settlement on our waterways was becoming apparent,” he says. “We messed up pretty much the flow of every river we’ve got. We cleared native vegetation along most of our waterways, and, not surprisingly, that put a lot of pressure on the platypus population.” Replanting programs along the waterways, and consideration of environmental impacts near rivers, have started to help the population come back. “We’ve still got a way to go, and we can’t be complacent,” Williams says. “But the good news at the moment is most of the survey work that’s being done around the place is suggesting numbers that are coming back, certainly the number of sightings in some places where there was concern.”",Cait Kelly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research suggests that rather than being a slow and steady process, aging occurs in at least two accelerated bursts. The study, which tracked thousands of different molecules in people aged 25 to 75, detected two major waves of age-related changes at around ages 44 and again at 60. The findings could explain why spikes in certain health issues including musculoskeletal problems and cardiovascular disease occur at certain ages. “We’re not just changing gradually over time. There are some really dramatic changes,” said Prof Michael Snyder, a geneticist and director of the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford University and senior author of the study. “It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s – and that’s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.” The research tracked 108 volunteers, who submitted blood and stool samples and skin, oral and nasal swabs every few months for between one and nearly seven years. Researchers assessed 135,000 different molecules (RNA, proteins and metabolites) and microbes (the bacteria, viruses and fungi living in the guts and on the skin of the participants). The abundance of most molecules and microbes did not shift in a gradual, chronological fashion. When the scientists looked for clusters of molecules with the largest shifts, they found these transformations tended to occur when people were in their mid-40s and early 60s. The mid-40s ageing spike was unexpected and initially assumed to be a result of perimenopausal changes in women skewing results for the whole group. But the data revealed similar shifts were happening in men in their mid-40s, too. “This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women,” said Dr Xiaotao Shen, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford medical school and first author of the study who is now based at Nanyang Technological University Singapore. The first wave of changes included molecules linked to cardiovascular disease and the ability to metabolise caffeine, alcohol and lipids. The second wave of changes included molecules involved in immune regulation, carbohydrate metabolism and kidney function. Molecules linked to skin and muscle ageing changed at both time points. Previous research suggested that a later may occur around the age of 78, but the latest study could not confirm this because the oldest participants were 75. The pattern fits with previous evidence that the risk of many age-related diseases does not increase incrementally, with Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease risk showing a steep uptick after 60. It is also possible that some of the changes could be linked to lifestyle or behavioural factors. For instance, the change in alcohol metabolism could result from an uptick in consumption in people’s mid-40s, which can be a stressful period of life. The findings could help target interventions, such as increasing exercise during periods of more rapid muscle loss, the authors said. “I’m a big believer that we should try to adjust our lifestyles while we’re still healthy,” Snyder said. The findings are published in the journal",Hannah Devlin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What dark matter is made from, and whether it is even real, are still open questions, but according to a study, the first direct evidence of the substance may finally have been glimpsed. More work is needed to rule out less exotic explanations, but if true, the discovery would go down as a turning point in the decades-long search for the elusive substance that is said to make up 27% of the cosmos. “This could be a crucial breakthrough in unraveling the nature of dark matter,” said Prof Tomonori Totani, an astrophysicist at the University of Tokyo, who said gamma rays emanating from the centre of the Milky Way appeared to bear the signature of the substance. Dark matter was first described in the 1930s, when the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that distant galaxies appeared to be spinning faster than their mass allowed. The observations led to the notion of dark matter, a material that neither emits nor absorbs light, but exerts an unseen gravitational pull on the galaxies it surrounds. Scientists have searched for dark matter particles ever since, but so far ground-based detectors, space-based telescopes and vast machines such as the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva have drawn a blank. One of the many theories of dark matter postulates that it is made from so-called weakly interacting massive particles, or wimps, which are heavier than the protons found inside atoms, but barely interact with normal matter. When two wimps collide, they can annihilate one another, releasing other particles and a burst of gamma rays. To search for potential dark matter signals, Totani analysed data from Nasa’s Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope, which detects the most energetic photons in the electromagnetic spectrum. He spotted a pattern of gamma rays that appeared to match the shape of the dark matter halo that spreads out in a sphere from the heart of the galaxy. The signal “closely matches the properties of gamma-ray radiation predicted to be emitted by dark matter,” Totani told the Guardian. Details are If Totani has seen dark matter at work, the observations suggest it is made from elementary particles 500 times more massive than the proton. But far more work is needed to rule out other astrophysical processes and background emissions that could explain the signals. Totani said the “decisive factor” would be detecting gamma rays with the same spectrum from other regions of space, such as dwarf galaxies. According to Prof Justin Read, an astrophysicist at the University of Surrey, the lack of significant signals from such galaxies strongly argues against Totani having seen gamma rays emitted from dark matter particle annihilation. Prof Kinwah Wu, a theoretical astrophysicist at UCL, also urged caution. “I appreciate the author’s hard work and dedication, but we need extraordinary evidence for an extraordinary claim,” he said. “This analysis has not reached this status yet. It is a piece of work which serves as an encouragement for the workers in the field to keep on pressing.”",Ian Sample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr Stefanie Lehner can tell you. A senior lecturer at Queen’s, Lehner conducts around post-conflict literary and cultural work, and is fascinated by the ways in which these three works look back to the Troubles. Yet, despite the trauma and tragedies that they deal with, they also foreground small glimmers of “utopian potentials” for the future. The period of violent conflict known as the Troubles took place in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until 1998. It centred primarily around political clashes between Protestant unionists, who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK, and Catholic nationalists, who favoured joining the Republic of Ireland. It is estimated that more than 3,500 people lost their lives in the conflict, and tens of thousands more were injured. “Milkman and Trespasses … they’re both set during the Troubles,” Lehner explains. “Even though they’re narratives that deal very much with the conflict and the trauma involved with the conflict, they evoke these small utopian possibilities. And that’s what a lot of recent queer productions have been doing as well.” Namely Tactics for Time Travel in a Toilet, a play produced by Belfast-based gay theatre company “Utopian” outcomes sound enticing, particularly given the number of global conflicts, which is at its highest since the end of the second world war, according to the . If we can better understand how societies deal with and heal from conflict, through an analysis of the arts or other disciplines, this is welcome indeed. Researchers at Queen’s are at the forefront of this interrogation. Tactics for Time Travel in a Toilet was part of a research project called , for which Lehner was a co-investigator. “The toilet is here not only a space for a countercultural critique of Northern Ireland’s peace politics, which have excluded LGBT people, but also a space from which to imagine alternative visions of Northern Ireland in the future,” she said about the play in a . It’s a lot to fit into a cubicle. More expansive perhaps, but just as relevant has been Lehner’s work on Sounding Conflict – a project investigating how sound (including sonic arts, participatory music-making and storytelling in theatre) can realise narratives of conflict, resistance and reconciliation across cultures. Comparative case studies with projects in the Middle East, Brazil and Northern Ireland serve as a basis for evaluating how sound is used to articulate experiences of violence, support narratives of resistance and promote peace building. This work was documented and published as a co-authored monograph in 2023, titled “I worked with three local theatre companies, including Tinderbox and Kabosh, to investigate the role of sounds in selected theatre performances dealing with conflict,” says Lehner. “What was notable was that intrusive, war-like noises in these plays attained a transformative power that enabled new perspectives to emerge, which helped to open new pathways to approach reconciliation.” It’s all very discursive, as interdisciplinary research tends to be, and Lehner is clearly passionate about her subject. Being part of the academic community at Queen’s, specifically the , has been a great privilege and honour, she says, adding: “It’s really developed my research.” Founded in 2016, the institute aims to respond to the global challenge of building a peaceful, secure and inclusive world by bringing together experts from a multitude of disciplines, such as the arts, education and gender studies. Dr Laura Dunne, a fellow Queen’s researcher affiliated with the institute, studies through a different lens. She’s a developmental psychologist and focuses on how to improve outcomes for disadvantaged children, particularly in societies emerging from conflict. Her research journey at Queen’s began in 2003 and over time it’s become increasingly interdisciplinary. “If you want to figure out the many influences that affect children’s lives and development on their trajectory through life, you can’t just view the world as a psychologist,” she says. One of the projects Dunne has been heavily involved with is . Supported by the National Institute for Health Research and UNICEF, it’s a global network of researchers and practitioners who work in low- and middle-income countries that have been affected by conflict. The group looks at early childhood development programmes and how they can contribute to sustainable development and peacebuilding. But how exactly do these topics connect? “It doesn’t seem obvious from the outside,” says Dunne, “but if we invest in high quality programmes that work – such as looking after young mothers in low- and middle-income countries, providing safe and clean food and drinking water, and early education experiences for children – we see improvements in terms of early childhood development. And if you wrap these programmes around families and communities, social cohesion, which is part of peacebuilding, improves as well.” Dunne gives an example of work that she was a part of in Timor-Leste, a country that went through a period of political violence, repression and following Indonesia’s invasion in 1975. With only very rudimentary education systems in place, UNICEF set up community-based alternative preschools around which families and communities began to coalesce, thus building social cohesion, says Dunne. “In fragile contexts that are affected by conflict, what you find is that trust has been broken in relation to figures of authority, in ministries and governments, so when we start to build vertical cohesion – when things begin to work on the ground – that trust starts to build again.” In terms of Northern Ireland and its peacebuilding process, Dunne mentions the Media Initiative for Children project, which was developed by Early Years to promote positive attitudes to physical, social and cultural differences among young children, and introduced in educational settings more than 20 years ago. It has since been replicated in countries around the world such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. In an effort to respect difference and build empathy for different members of a community, persona dolls that resembled diverse groups were rolled out in educational settings across the country. “In Northern Ireland, there was a persona doll with an eye patch, a persona doll from the Traveller community, and there were dolls who were from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. There were all sorts of vignettes and stories, as well as a cartoon series that ran alongside it,” says Dunne. “The outcome was that children were able to see that they could be friends with their neighbours. They could say: ‘I can understand them. I can understand they’re different, but I respect that,’” she says. Recent research – carried out by Dunne’s colleagues at Queen’s – that was wrapped around the project demonstrated the positive impacts of the programme, she says, and has since been rolled out around the world. “At the moment we’re talking to colleagues in Ukraine about possibly adapting the programme there. Children are not born hating or fearing each other, that’s something that’s learned.” Dunne’s and Lehner’s research is complex and multifaceted, which speaks to the rich academic environment that it comes out of. Both emphasise the deeply collaborative environment that the university provides, which ultimately makes their work possible. “We have a fantastic group who are all working on very similar, interrelated themes: the larger role of the arts [and other subjects] in peacebuilding and conflict resolution,” says Lehner. “We’re lucky, we have PhD students working on similar topics, so that creates very stimulating debates and discussion. It’s a beautiful environment.”",Sarah LaBrecque,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The forgotten Dutch invention that created the modern world,2025-12-08T07:10:43.000Z,"There are many contenders for “world’s greatest invention.” The wheel. The printing press. The steam engine. According to a new book, however, that title should go to the mechanised sawmill invented by Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon in 1593. “Before mechanised sawing, constructing a modest merchant vessel required approximately ten sawyers working for three months,” writes Jaime Dávila in . “With wind-powered sawmills, the same quantity of processed timber could be produced in less than a week.” Thanks to their speedy mechanical saw, which turned logs into planks with almost no human effort, the Dutch could build ships faster than anyone else, which unleashed a century of Dutch maritime, economic and cultural dominance in Europe and the world. Corneliszoon’s sawmill, argues Dávila, was “mankind’s first true industrial machine.” A windmill turned a wheel. One component transformed the rotary motion into up-and-down motion for the cutting blade. Another component transformed the rotary motion into a sideway’s motion feeding the log to the blade. A ratchet system moved the log forward one precise increment per cycle. “Each element was modest on its own. Corneliszoon’s genius was to combine them so they acted in a perfectly controlled sequence, cutting on every downward stroke and advancing on every return stroke. It was an astonishingly intelligent use of basic components.” Which brings us to today’s puzzle. I’d like you to reinvent one of the basic ideas behind Corneliszoon’s machine. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solution. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS.

Millions of people worldwide have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a disease of the heart muscle where the wall of the heart becomes thickened. It is caused by a change in one or more genes and mostly passed on through families. Some feel fine most of the time and have few or no symptoms. But others can suffer complications, such as heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms, which can lead to a cardiac arrest. The problem is there is no cure. Doctors also with the genetic condition are most at risk from deadly complications. But now a team of scientists from universities including Harvard and Oxford have found a way to forecast risk for people living with HCM. The blood test could identify those patients most in danger of complications, enabling them to be monitored more closely or receive life-saving treatment. In a landmark study, the team measured the levels of a protein, N-terminal Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP), in the blood of 700 HCM patients. NT-Pro-BNP is released by the heart as part of normal pumping. But high levels are a sign the heart is working too hard. Those with the highest levels had poorer blood flow, more scar tissue and changes in their heart which could lead to atrial fibrillation or heart failure. A blood test measuring NT-Pro-BNP could transform the care of millions of people with the world’s most common inherited heart condition. The study leader, Prof Carolyn Ho, the medical director of the cardiovascular genetics centre at Harvard medical school, said the test could help “target the right therapies to the right patients at the right time”. She added: “Continued studies on blood biomarkers will lead to better understanding of HCM so that, in future, we can offer our patients a blood test to identify who is at high versus low risk of experiencing serious consequences of the disease. “People with the highest risk could be targeted for potentially life-saving treatments as they stand to receive the greatest benefit, while those at lowest risk could avoid unnecessary treatment.” Lara Johnson, 34, from Southampton in the UK, is one of many who could benefit. Eight years ago, she began experiencing breathlessness and fatigue. After being referred by her GP for hospital tests, she was diagnosed with HCM. Several relatives on her father’s side were subsequently also diagnosed with the condition. “One of the hardest parts of living with HCM is the constant uncertainty, never knowing what might change next,” Johnson said. “A simple blood test, which could help identify future risks earlier, would take away so much of that anxiety.” She added: “It could give people like me a chance to prepare and adjust our lifestyles as needed, and help us to feel more in control. That kind of clarity wouldn’t only help me, it would make a world of difference for my whole family.” Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer of the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said the test “could benefit patients around the world”. “After a diagnosis of HCM, patients and their families want to know what the future holds. This study shows that measuring various proteins circulating in the blood could help predict how the heart is functioning and future risk of complications from heart disease. “This new method may also provide insights in the evolution of the structure and function of the heart in people with HCM that could point to new ways of treating this condition to reduce future risk.”",Andrew Gregory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the latest step in the administration’s climate Lysenkoism and its relentless purge of climate researchers who refuse to be co-opted into its quest for American energy dominance though fossil fuels. Stalin’s embrace of the work of Trofim Denisovitch Lysenko, who wrongly believed that wheat could inherit characteristics acquired by previous generations, underpinned policies that failed to prevent crop failures and millions of deaths from famine during the 1930s. Scientists who opposed Lysenkoism were denounced, fired, imprisoned and even executed. While Trump has not gone as far as Stalin, his administration’s persecution of climate researchers could ultimately lead to many millions of deaths from increases in extreme weather and sea level rise in the United States and across the world. Six years ago, we warned in of the dangers of climate Lysenkoism during Trump’s first presidential term. Little did we know that there would be a second term and an even more extreme war against scientific reality. , the Trump administration’s preferred propaganda platform, by , the director of the office of management and budget. He laughably described NCAR as “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country”, but it is transparently part of the Trump administration’s promotion of wilful ignorance about climate change. We both have direct experience of the deep expertise and careful methodology of the many generations of scientists who have worked at NCAR, a stark contrast with the blatant mischaracterisation offered by Vought. He is the architect of climate Lysenkoism during Trump’s second term, and Vought laid out his plans to eliminate all governmental knowledge and understanding of climate change in his earlier this year that proposed to end funding for most government laboratories and institutions that carry out any work related to climate change. Fortunately, Congress rejected most of the funding cuts in the administration’s budget, but Vought will no doubt try again next year as part of the administration’s promotion of climate Lysenkoism. While it is difficult to understand the workings of Donald Trump’s mind, his administration’s pretence that climate change does not exist is in line with his ambition to make the United States and the rest of the world more dependent on American oil, gas and coal. Trump’s presidential campaign received at least $75m from oil and gas interests, , and he promised to repay their investments through his administration’s support for more exploration and production. The administration’s war on climate researchers helps to shield oil and gas executives from criticism of the damage that their industry is causing. We are both seeing first-hand the impact of this at the in New Orleans, where scientists usually gather to discuss the latest advancements in climate research. This year, there are far fewer climate scientists taking part, with many federally funded researchers having lost their jobs or had their budgets slashed. However, there are signs that the administration’s attempt to promote a bogus version of climate science is not advancing quite as smoothly as they had hoped. In July, the Department of Energy published a ludicrous report that attempted to present a revisionist account of established climate science. , was commissioned by Chris Wright, the former head of the oil and gas company Liberty Energy, whom Donald Trump selected to be energy secretary and chief propagandist. The report was written by five scientists who were obviously selected to produce a version of climate science that was aligned with the administration’s political agenda. , launched on the same day, to overturn the supreme court’s so-called , which requires the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. However, a group of more than 85 climate scientists Wright’s report in September, exposing numerous fundamental errors and falsehoods. They showed that the Department of Energy report was a blatant example of policy-based evidence-making. In addition, the highly respected and authoritative National Academy of Sciences published in September that concluded “the evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs [greenhouse gases] is beyond scientific dispute”. It is now widely expected that the comprehensive demolition of Wright’s report means the Environmental Protection Agency will drop references to the science when it publishes in the new year its updated case for overturning the endangerment finding. Sadly, this setback is unlikely to stop the Trump administration’s assault on researchers, and its Soviet-style campaign to prevent Americans and the rest of the world from knowing the truth about climate change. The Trump administration continues to act as if the story of the ransacking of the library of Alexandria is a playbook instead of a cautionary tale.

Scientists working for the government have been breeding species in labs to set them loose into the wild to take on Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and Himalayan balsam, and other species that choke out native plants and wildlife. They are doing this, in part, to meet tough targets set by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in its recently announced . Ministers have directed the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) to reduce the establishment of invasive species by 50% by 2030. Olaf Booy, deputy chief non-native species officer at Apha, said: “The science around biological control is always developing. It really works for those species that were introduced quite a long time ago, that we haven’t been able to prevent getting here or detect early and rapidly respond.” Scientists have been working out which species would be able to tackle the invasive pests by killing them and reducing their ability to spread, without harming other organisms. Booy said the perk of biological control agents was they reduced the need for human labour. This includes targeting floating pennywort, which spreads and chokes the life from rivers, by releasing the South American weevil . Where weevils have overwintered for several years, floating pennywort biomass appears reduced across a number of release sites. Defra has also employed specialist scientists at the Centre for and Bioscience International (Cabi) to conduct biological control (biocontrol) research into the use of naturally occurring, living organisms to tackle Japanese knotweed. Cabi has targeted this species using the release of the psyllid , which feeds on the plant. Similarly, Cabi has been trialling the release of the rust fungus to tackle Himalayan balsam. Defra said the results of the release were encouraging and would continue at compatible sites. “Once the biocontrol agent is working properly, then it should actually start to spread naturally across the range, where the non-native species is, and it will start to bring that population of the non-native species down,” Booy said. “Hopefully, once it starts to establish in the wild, then it sort of starts taking over itself, and the human effort bit starts to reduce significantly.” As well as releasing biological control agents into the wild, government scientists have been breeding threatened species to protect their populations from invasion. Britain’s native white-clawed crayfish has disappeared from most of the country since the invasive American signal crayfish was introduced in the 1970s. These non-native creatures outcompete the native crayfish and carry a deadly plague, making eradication or containment virtually impossible. Invasive species experts have created protected “ark sites”: safe habitats where white-clawed crayfish can survive free from threats. A new hatchery has been set up in Yorkshire to release them into the wild in secure locations, and in Devon the Wildwood Trust is expanding its hatchery, building a bespoke ark site pond, and rescuing crayfish from rivers under threat. More than 1,500 breeding-age crayfish so far have been translocated to eight safe sites in Gloucestershire. The creatures Booy is most concerned about establishing in the wild , which are kept as pets but are very good at escaping into the wild. The medium-sized predators could be harmful to the amphibians and small birds they feed on, he said. At the moment, keepers of raccoons and raccoon dogs do not have to register with the government, though breeding and selling them is banned. Social media trends depicting raccoons as cuddly and desirable pets could be a concern, he said: “You do see things like raccoons and raccoon dogs popping up on social media and stuff. Particularly raccoons, they’re kind of cute and cuddly, and you could imagine that a TikTok trend might encourage people to think about getting a species like that. Obviously years ago we had the interest in terrapins from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” He added: “If you have a raccoon, you really need to know how to keep it securely to avoid it escaping. You don’t really want any predators of that sort of size establishing and spreading in the country, because it will have knock-on impacts for biodiversity. But they are also potentially vectors of disease as well.” The biosecurity minister and Labour peer Sue Hayman said: “With a changing climate we are constantly assessing for new risks and threats, including from invasive plants and animals, as well as managing the impacts of species already in this country. Invasive non-native species cost Britain’s economy nearly £2bn a year, and our environmental improvement plan sets out plans to reduce their establishment to protect native wildlife and farmers’ livelihoods.”",Helena Horton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sad, imploring expression held such power over humans during 33,000 years of canine domestication that the preference for dogs that could pull off the look steered the evolution of their facial muscles, researchers have said. The result is that dogs gradually acquired a new forehead muscle named the levator anguli oculi medialis, or LAOM, and have used it to deploy the doleful look to devastating effect ever since. “They are very powerful animals in how they capture our hearts,” said Prof Bridget Waller, the director of the Centre for Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Portsmouth. “ , they are meaningful to us, and this expression makes dogs look juvenile and sad. It induces a nurturing response. It’s a cute factor.” Puppy dog eyes are achieved by the LAOM raising the inner eyebrows, in some cases quite dramatically. The movement makes the eyes look larger and the face more babyish. Humans use different muscles to produce a similar expression when they are sad, which may explain why it brings out the caregiver in people. To investigate how the look developed in dogs, the UK-US research team acquired wolf and dog cadavers from taxidermists and US state organisations and dissected their heads to compare the facial muscles. No animals were killed for the research. Dissections of six dogs – a chihuahua, a labrador, a bloodhound, a German shepherd, a Siberian husky and a mongrel – found all had the LAOM muscle. But in the four grey wolves studied, the muscle was missing, save for a few scant muscle fibres. Since all dogs are derived from wolves, the comparison suggests the LAOM arose in the domestication process. Only one other difference was noted in the head dissections. A muscle called the retractor anguli oculi lateralis (RAOL), which pulls the eyelids out towards the ears, was less prominent in wolves than dogs. The Siberian husky, one of the most ancient breeds, was the only dog found to lack the RAOL muscle, according to the report in the journal After establishing that dogs and wolves have different muscles around the eyes, the researchers filmed the animals to see how their expressions varied. They filmed nine wolves in two different animal parks, and 27 dogs, mostly Staffordshire bull terriers, in shelters across the UK. The footage was reviewed by a trained specialist who was not told about the scientists’ hypothesis. The specialist recorded when the animals made the puppy dog eyes expression, and rated its intensity on a five-point scale. Dogs pulled the doleful face far more frequently than wolves, but the most striking finding was the intensity of the expressions. While dogs and wolves both produced “low intensity” expressions, only dogs appear to have weaponised the look and achieved what the scientists classified as “high intensity expressions”. The look has a real impact. In , Waller showed that the more dogs deployed the expression, the faster they were rehomed from shelters. In that regard, puppy dog eyes were more effective than tail wagging or the speed at which dogs bounded over to visiting humans. Waller does not believe dogs originally produced the expression to win humans over. More likely, she said, is that animals that happened to deploy puppy dog eyes tapped into a response humans had evolved over millennia of living in large groups, where reading facial expressions was crucial.",Ian Sample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Britain must build NHS capacity so that cures become collective goods, not expensive products can cause disease when disrupted – yet that sliver accounts for .

But therapies are expensive and complex to develop. The cost of bringing any new drug to patients is now around $2bn, in part because, as Brian David Smith notes in , the “success rate, from discovery to market, is tiny” and there are approved treatments for “less than 10% of the 8,000 diseases that affect humans”. Commercial incentives, he argues, skew innovation towards lucrative cancer drugs and long-term treatments for large populations. Complex gene therapies for very rare conditions are seen as too costly to develop and too small to profit from. gene therapy to treat a young patient with relapsed T-cell leukaemia at Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) in London.

Sustaining pioneering work cannot rely on philanthropy alone. His technological advance – “off‑the-shelf” edited T-cells – would require industrial-scale manufacturing to become widely available, and the market alone will not build it. GOSH’s hints at the promise – and limits – of the therapy. Biotech’s boom-time cash has moved on to silicon chips and artificial intelligence. That is why a milestone in prime editing – a DNA “search and replace” technology – was announced this May with a warning. Prime Medicine, the company behind the therapy, had successfully treated a teenager with a rare immune disorder but it would halt future work. The geopolitics of big pharma is also changing. Firms are shifting research and manufacturing toward nations with scale and long-term policy support, such as China and the US. Britain looks exposed. has already forced the UK to accept higher prices for NHS medicines under threat of tariffs. This means less cash to support patients and for breakthrough therapies. Per-patient costs of gene therapies can go up to . If the cure exists and the business model does not, the latter must change. Britain needs state-backed manufacturing for medical sovereignty – though it must not ignore the reality that China can already produce some gene therapies considerably more cheaply. What’s needed is a renewed social contract in which innovation is shared, not hoarded. Rare-disease gene therapy could be treated like dialysis or transplants: an NHS service funded collectively, not a market good. Many experimental treatments could remain in long-running NHS research programmes, offered at cost while the science matures. Only a universal, publicly funded health system – with and lifelong follow-up – can make gene therapy medicine, rather than merchandise. Without the NHS and charities, the breakthroughs remain in the lab.

The drop that researchers found was a “super big deal”, said Arlene Blum, the director of the Green Science Policy Institute who has for decades worked to reduce the level of flame retardants in consumer goods. “To my mind, that’s a pretty dramatic change, and it shows how you can effect change and improve public health with a regulation,” Blum said. Most furniture made with foam between about 1975 and 2015 contained any of a range of toxic flame retardants that are linked to serious health problems, and especially present a risk for kids. scrapped requirements for several of the most toxic and common flame retardants used in furniture. The California department of public health and environmental non-profits at the time checked for flame retardants in the blood of dozens of people that had furniture with the chemicals, and monitored levels over the next 10 years. Flame retardant levels dropped about four times faster in the blood of those that removed furniture with flame retardants compared with those who didn’t. The levels in blood on average were reduced by about half within just 1.4 years. Flame retardants commonly used in furniture are linked to serious health issues, including cancer, neurotoxicity, thyroid disease, pre-term birth, decreased fertility, deficits in motor skills, and a drop in IQ in children. During the mid-1970s, state and federal legislators passed laws requiring a range of products to meet flammability standards, including furniture, electronics, car seats and kids’ pyjamas. But the first generation of flame retardants were found to be highly toxic, and Blum led advocacy in 1977 that helped stop the use of the most dangerous in kids’ pyjamas. Later generations of flame retardants have proven to be nearly as toxic as the first. In 2015, after years of pressure, California updated its flammability standards to eliminate a requirement for chemical flame retardants in furniture. The retardants often break off from furniture and attach to dust that is inhaled or ingested. Researchers found much lower levels of flame retardants in the dust of homes from which the furniture was removed. A few years later, the state banned some of the most dangerous flame retardant compounds in furniture and other goods, and Congress adopted a similar measure in 2020. The furniture industry has largely moved away from using any flame retardants, Blum said, meaning the level of the chemicals in Americans’ blood more broadly is probably dropping as the furniture is disposed of. Blum recommends replacing furniture made between 1975 and 2015 with products made before or after that period. Replacing foam in couch cushions can be a more economical safeguard, she said. If those options are not in the budget, regularly dusting and using a vacuum with a Hepa filter can help reduce the amount of flame retardants in a home.",Tom Perkins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/flu-season-peaked-early-nhs,Don’t call it a ‘super flu’ – but the NHS is right to be worried this winter,2025-12-15T12:00:04.000Z,"An early flu season, a new variant and poor takeup of vaccines leave the already vulnerable health service in a dangerous position Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh ou might be feeling stressed out seeing the headlines about “ ” and comparing the current winter health challenges with 2020 and Covid. Amid all the noise, it’s difficult to know how bad this flu really is – and how much is political spin. I should start by saying “super flu” is not a scientific term or one used by any academics or clinicians I work with. It’s a colloquial phrase that’s been used by various NHS England bosses and taken up by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and This year, a couple of factors have come together to make it a harder flu season for hospitals to manage. First, flu has arrived earlier than previous years. This isn’t unique to the UK: it’s the same picture across the US, Canada, Japan, Germany – basically the northern hemisphere going into winter. This is in the context of multiple viruses circulating such as Covid and rhinoviruses, which means patients could be fighting one or more viruses at the same time and are more susceptible to getting sicker from influenza. The current level of hospitalisations usually occurs in January, but it’s happening a month earlier. According to recent , flu-related hospital admissions have risen sharply in December 2025, with figures showing an average of around 2,660 flu patients in hospital per day, the highest level recorded for this time of year, and a 55% rise in admissions in just one week. A&E attendances for flu and respiratory illness overall have also reached record levels, compounding pressure on emergency services. When we refer to seasonal flu, the predominant circulating strains are H1N1 and H3N2 (both influenza A) and influenza B. All three are included in this year’s influenza vaccine. H3N2 is more severe as a “flu” than the other strains, especially among those who are elderly or young children. This winter, a new variant of H3N2 has emerged, called K. This strain emerged (through mutation) too late to be included in the update for this year’s seasonal vaccine. This means that the vaccine offers less-than-ideal protection. This is not unusual for seasonal flu vaccines, given how quickly the influenza virus mutates. Does this mean this year’s flu vaccine doesn’t work? No, not at all. While not perfect, it still offers partial protection against H3N2, and against the two other strains circulating. Real-world vaccine effectiveness data from the shows that even with the subclade K H3N2 dominating cases, the 2025–26 seasonal vaccine still provides typical protection: around 72–75% effectiveness against emergency department attendance and hospital admission in children and adolescents, and 32–39% effectiveness in adults. That means vaccinated people are significantly less likely to be hospitalised compared with unvaccinated people, even if infection isn’t completely prevented. But there’s another problem this winter in the UK: both the take-up and the provision of the flu vaccine. Among those at-risk groups covered by the NHS, indicates around only 40% of people under 65 in clinical risk groups and roughly 42.6% of two- to three-year-olds were vaccinated, while uptake in those aged 65 or over was higher at around 74.9%. We, the public health community, haven’t done a good enough job explaining to people how serious a disease flu can be and the benefits of vaccination, or making it easy to get jabbed. But what about if you’re not in an NHS-covered group, and just don’t want to get severely ill with flu this year? Unfortunately, the in the private market, meaning many pharmacies have low or no stock. It’s a bizarre situation. The cost to get vaccinated (prevention) falls on individuals who need to take time off from work, potentially visit multiple pharmacies to find a jab, and pay £18-20. This is time and money that many people would struggle to find, given other pressing demands. But if someone goes unvaccinated and is admitted to hospital, the cost falls on the and taxpayers into tens of thousands of pounds for admissions, plus adds to the huge patient load. These are the opposite incentives to what we should have for individuals. Coming to hospitals, the UK government is correct in saying that they are in a critical state, but this is because there is little surge capacity. As one clinician told me: “Both primary care and secondary care run close to or at capacity all the time, so any increase in illness tips the system over capacity and into ‘crisis’.” Hospital bosses are worried because if December already looks this bad (like a typical January would), what will January and February be like? The million-dollar question is: have we hit the peak already for flu (and just had an earlier season), or is the entire baseline going to be higher for the coming months, which would be very worrying? I don’t think anyone knows the answer. I do worry that we need to be careful of crying wolf, and calling it “super flu”. This is not a novel pathogen (like SARS-CoV-2) which made many people critically ill, and where we had no vaccine, no diagnostics and no treatments, plus no prior immunity in the global population. Overstating also carries that risk that if we do get a step-change in a virus – like – causing human-to-human transmission with a high fatality rate, that people are desensitised to public health information. Covid was a once-in-a-century pandemic. I don’t think you can compare what’s happening now to that at all. The NHS is struggling and in crisis, but not because of a “super flu”. It is struggling because flu season has come early, vaccines are offering partial protection from a mutated circulating strain, there has been poor take-up and inaccessibility of the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is a health service that hits a critical state every single winter. As a final aside, is it too late to get vaccinated? Not at all – I’d strongly encourage you to find a local pharmacy with stock and get protected going into the festive period.

According to the Met Office, high pressure is building – meaning that, while some areas may experience showers, many will have drier and more settled weather. The UK’s national meteorological service added that a strong easterly breeze would make it feel colder – although not unusually so for this time of year, with temperatures on Christmas Day expected to reach a daytime high of 7C and night-time lows at -3C or -4C. As a result, Father Christmas might be accompanied by Jack Frost. “The south coast of England down towards South Devon and Cornwall perhaps [has] the greatest chance of seeing the odd wintry flurry if there were to be [any],” Marco Petagna, of the Met Office, told the Guardian. “Of course, for a white Christmas, technically now all we need is one flake of snow to fall anywhere in the UK. And it’s not an unusual occurrence – it’s more unusual for it to be lying snow.” (RMetS), a snowflake has tumbled from the sky on Christmas Day 54 times over the past 66 years at least somewhere in the UK, and except for 2024, every year since 2020 has technically been deemed “white”. In 2023, 11% of weather stations recorded snow falling on Christmas Day, and 9% in 2022, although snow was not recorded as settling in either year. Indeed, as the RMetS notes, a thick blanket of snow at Christmas has only occurred four times since 1960 – in 1981, 1995, 2009 and 2010 – with 2010 having snow on the ground at 83% of stations, the highest percentage ever recorded. But anyone expecting festive snowball fights is likely to be in for a disappointment this year. “The chance of noteworthy snowfall is only around 10%, so nothing significant,” said Petagna. It was not always thus: the meant that between the 16th and 19th centuries it was more common to have a harsh winter – perhaps explaining why the writings of Charles Dickens, who was born in 1812, often refer to a cold and snowy Christmas. In addition, before 1752, when the transition to the Gregorian calendar was completed in Britain, 25 December fell later in the winter. More recently, particularly harsh winters have included those of 1946–47 and 1962-63. “Much of England remained covered in snow every day from late December until early March 1963,” the Met Office The rarity of festive snow cover today is, perhaps, not a surprise, given the climate crisis. Met Office data has revealed Decembers in the UK – conditions Met Office experts say reduce the overall chance of snowfall on Christmas day, although natural variability means cold and snowy spells can still occur. But just because a snowy Christmas is unlikely this year, it doesn’t mean snowballs are a thing of the past: the notes that most of the UK’s snow days happen between January and March. As the poet Sara Coleridge put it: “January brings the snow, makes our feet and fingers glow.”",Nicola Davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But not everyone was convinced – and the bitter argument that followed has consumed the lives of scholars ever since n a late-summer day in 2001, at the University of Poitiers in west-central France, the palaeontologist Michel Brunet summoned his colleagues into a classroom to examine an unusual skull. Brunet had just returned from Chad, and brought with him an extremely ancient cranium. It had been distorted by the aeons spent beneath what is now the Djurab desert; a crust of black mineral deposits left it looking charred and slightly malevolent. It sat on a table. “What this thing?” Brunet wondered aloud. He was behaving a bit theatrically, the professor Roberto Macchiarelli recalled not long ago. Brunet was a devoted teacher and scientist, then 61, but his competitive impulses were also known to be immoderate, and he seemed to take a ruthless pleasure in the jealousy of his peers. “Michel is a dominant male,” Macchiarelli told me. “He’s a silverback gorilla.” Inspecting the skull, one could make out a mosaic of features at once distinctly apelike and distinctly human: a small braincase and prominent brow ridge, but also what seemed to be a rather unprotruding jaw, smallish canines and a foramen magnum – the hole at the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects to the brain – that suggested the possibility of an upright bearing, a two-legged gait. Macchiarelli told Brunet he did not know what to make of it. “Right answer!” Brunet said. The discovery was announced to the world the following year on the cover of Nature, the leading scientific journal, and in a televised ceremony in the Chadian capital, N’Djamena. “A new hominid is born,” Brunet declared. “By virtue of his age, he is the ancestor of all Chadians. But also the ancestor of the whole of humankind!” The skull, which Brunet called “Toumaï” – a name from the Djurab, meaning “hope of life” – belonged to a two-legged animal of the Upper Miocene epoch, between 6 and 7m years old. Assuming it was indeed our distant forebear, it was the most ancient ever found, by a margin of as much as 1m years. The location of its discovery furthermore suggested that the human lineage might not have evolved in the savannas of the Great Rift valley of east Africa, as long understood, but rather about 1,500 miles west, in what were once the gallery forests of the greater Sahara. Toumaï stood to upend our very notions of how and why we came to be, to “fundamentally change the way we reconstruct the tree of life”, one prominent palaeontologist wrote. Brunet, to whom the honour of naming the new species fell, called it But immediately questions were raised about whether the species was correctly assigned to the human lineage. The authors of a sneering letter in Nature suggested renaming it “ ” (“Sahel Ape”), most notably because it did not, according to their counter-analysis of the skull, walk on two feet – bipedalism being one of the very few available criteria for identifying ancient members of our evolutionary branch. Yet it escaped the notice of no one in the field that some of the letter-writers were affiliated with another hominid species, which had, until the arrival of , held the record for the oldest known. And while the question of ’s gait was acknowledged to be a crucial one, the skull alone was not going to provide a definitive answer. For that, “postcrania” would be required: remains from the neck down, especially the lower body – a pelvis, a femur. Unfortunately, Brunet reported in Nature, none had been recovered. Brunet became a celebrity scientist. In France, he shared caviar with President Jacques Chirac. In Chad, where he ran a programme of field research, he befriended the dictator Idriss Déby; the Chadian national airline was soon renamed after Toumaï. In 2003, Brunet received a $1m Dan David award for discoveries that “cast a new light on the history of human origins”. In Poitiers, grant money poured in. Fame made Brunet grandiose and, in the opinion of some colleagues, slightly paranoid. He seemed to assume that everyone everywhere was consumed with the idea of studying Toumaï, “as if it were the most precious thing on Earth”, said Olga Otero, a researcher who worked with him for years. Brunet’s relations with Macchiarelli, in particular, deteriorated. He had recruited Macchiarelli, who was 15 years his junior, from Rome, and he seemed to expect a certain deference. The palaeontology group in Poitiers was organised to an unusual degree around Brunet, its director; he had a tendency to treat the other scientists as if they were his vassals, as mere “service providers”, Otero said, expecting them to conduct research that furthered his own work, and refusing to sign off on projects that did not. Many members, especially the graduate students, put up with it in exchange for the resources and visibility he afforded them, I was told. But Macchiarelli had no interest in pledging loyalty. “Doubts, additional questions, argument and criticism contribute to the strength, not the weakness, of scientific thought,” he told Nature in 2003. Brunet referred to him derisively as “the Italian”, Macchiarelli told me. In early 2004, Brunet and much of his group were in the Chadian desert with a film crew, making a documentary about Toumaï. In Poitiers, however, a master’s student named Aude Bergeret was undertaking a study of numerous Chadian fossils, including some from the zone where Toumaï itself had been recovered. One of these fossils, listed as an “undetermined long bone”, was scheduled to be cut in half for examination of the sediments inside. Bergeret wanted to be sure to extract as much information as possible from it beforehand. “There came a point where I was making observations, but I frankly wasn’t sure what I was looking at,” she told me. She needed guidance. The adviser who could have provided it was in the desert with Brunet. Macchiarelli, however, who had been one of her instructors, was on hand. Initially, Macchiarelli declined to examine the bone. He did not want to get between Bergeret and her advisers, he told me, and he was cognisant of the ethical norms of the field, which dictate that one does not study fossils unearthed by someone else without their express authorisation. His relations with Brunet were already tense. And he also knew that Brunet had a special sensitivity about Chadian remains, the most important of which had been recovered under circumstances that were, from Brunet’s perspective, far from ideal. Brunet had not in fact been in Chad for the discovery of the cranium that made him famous, and had not even authorised, much less directed, the small expedition that found it in 2001. Rather, a geographer named Alain Beauvilain, who handled the logistics of the Chadian operations, had, with three Chadian colleagues, set out from N’Djamena on an impromptu prospecting mission in the desert. Beauvilain, who had already been feuding with Brunet in the years before the discovery, was not shy about sharing these details with the world. As director of the research programme, Brunet was, by convention, the ultimate discoverer, but as soon as the description of Toumaï was published in Nature, he had Beauvilain recalled to France. And since then he had tried, in essence, to write him out of the story. Examining the Chadian fossils without Brunet’s OK was unorthodox and a bit risky, Macchiarelli realised. But a student was seeking his help, he told me. “In the end,” he said, “I thought to myself, He saw immediately that Bergeret’s long bone was the shaft of a left-hand femur. He took note of its robust diameter, its pronounced posterior ridge, its forward curvature: it was evident to Macchiarelli that it had belonged to a primate. “Aude, where is this piece from?” he asked, attempting to mask his mounting agitation. The femur’s inventory number suggested it had been collected from the same site, on the same day, as the skull. The crucial postcrania that Brunet said did not exist evidently did. “Don’t cut anything,” he said to Bergeret. “This appears to be the femur of Toumaï.” He gave Bergeret some reference papers, told her to spend the weekend making a close study of the femur, and left. “I went back to my office,” Macchiarelli said, “I closed the door, and I said to myself: Shit!” When he returned from Chad, Brunet was furious. According to Macchiarelli, he immediately spent several days studying the femur in the laboratory, behind closed doors. He soon asked to meet with Bergeret in his office. “Mademoiselle Bergeret, you were entrusted with study materials that were unidentified,” he told her, Bergeret recalled. “It was not your role to make an identification.” A laboratory meeting was convened in the presence of a university dean to discuss a “leak of scientific information”, as the minutes put it. One researcher alleged that there were “people who take advantage of our being away in the field to rifle through our collections”. Brunet spoke of “a Judas”. “A grave professional offence has been committed,” wrote the dean. In the meantime, Bergeret left for several days of fieldwork. When she returned, she found that her research materials had been confiscated; the fossils were being “renumbered”, she was told. At one point, however, Bergeret said, one of her advisers appeared with the femur in his hand. “This piece,” he warned, holding it before her: “You forget you ever saw it.” alaeoanthropology is a notoriously disputatious, not to say vicious, field. In part, this is an effect of self-selection: given its prestige, and its philosophical, even metaphysical implications, the study of human prehistory attracts the most ambitious and, as one member of the discipline put it to me, “the most psychotic”, palaeontologists. There is, additionally, a cultural divide within the field between, speaking very broadly, field workers and laboratory specialists. The former disdain the latter as “armchair palaeontologists”; the latter disdain the former as “fossil hunters”. But most of the fighting in palaeoanthropology is simply a function of the wild imbalance between the number of palaeoanthropologists, which is large, and the number of objects available for them to study, which is very much not. Our direct knowledge of the first few million years of human evolution derives from a collection of bone fragments that could no more than halfway fill a large shoebox. “It’s a bit frustrating,” the researcher Jean-Jacques Jaeger told me, with some understatement, “but there really is a gap in the palaeontological record between, I’d say, 14m and 5m years ago in Africa.” Among other things, the tectonics of this period were not conducive to fossil formation. Unfortunately, this period is precisely when the human line began. Still, the greatest conflicts in the field tend not to be over access to fossils but over the sense one makes of them. Attempting to reconstruct the history of early humanity from the available evidence is, it has been said, akin to trying to divine the plot of War and Peace from just 13 of its pages, picked at random. Major disagreements of interpretation are inevitable, as are major errors, and the discovery of a single new “page” can change everything we thought we understood about the broader story. What we call our knowledge of the deep human past is in fact overwhelmingly provisional, contingent upon whatever fossil happens to turn up next. “Lucy”, the remarkably complete skeleton of a species that came to be known as is the most famous case in point. At about 3m years old, Lucy was, at the time of her discovery in Ethiopia, in 1974, by far the most ancient hominid ever unearthed. She looked like nothing anyone had ever seen, with “an unexpected combination of a small-brained, apelike head and a fully erect body”, as the New York Times put it at the time. This strange morphology overturned a century-old presumption about what it was to be human. Until then, the human line was thought to be distinguished from the rest of nature largely by its superior intelligence. Lucy’s brain was tiny. And yet 3m years ago her species was already walking very much as we do. Though perhaps less flattering to our self-conception, uprightness turned out to be our deeper heritage. The smarts, such as they are, came later. If logic were the only factor, the flimsiness of our understanding would inspire restraint, and new fossil discoveries would only rarely give rise to grand pronouncements about the nature of humanity. But the impulse to make such pronouncements, heightened by the prospect of fame, not to mention grant money, can be overwhelming. There is a large and receptive audience for stories about the origins of humankind, however conjectural the stories may actually be. We yearn to know how and why we came to be ourselves, how humanity emerged out of nature. Frequently we yearn, as any historian of the prehistoric sciences will tell you, to the point of unreason. The result is a corpus of palaeoanthropological knowledge that is forever being not only revised but effectively rewritten, and then rewritten again. “A so-called science in which every new piece of evidence is claimed to overthrow all previous ideas must either be in a very juvenile state of development,” the palaeontologist Martin Pickford once wrote, “or it can’t really be a science at all, just a string of temporary opinions.” Pickford, a co-discoverer of the 6m-year-old species , knew whereof he spoke. A few years after he wrote that line, as the oldest hominid, and Pickford was penning his “ Even bipedality itself, which seemed so crucial after Lucy, is no longer taken as an obvious criterion for human-ness, at least not for the most ancient candidates. Our line evidently began walking upright at some point well before Lucy’s species emerged, but there is no agreement as to exactly when this habitual bipedalism began. It is entirely possible that our oldest ancestors walked not on two feet but four; it is entirely possible, conversely, that the most ancient panins – the ancestors of the chimpanzee and bonobo, our closest living relatives – walked on two legs just like their hominin contemporaries. The only trait that is in fact generally accepted as a reliable marker of our evolutionary branch alone is known as the “non-honing CP3 complex”. It has nothing to do with what most people would say if asked what makes us human. It describes the manner in which, when our jaws are closed, our canines and third lower premolars meet. Our uncertainty about the nature of humanity is compounded, too, by the realisation in recent decades that the deep past is a far messier place, biologically speaking, than had long been assumed. Most researchers now believe that, for most of the past several million years, numerous hominin species in fact lived simultaneously, much as , and our own species once did. But, setting aside the interbreeding that almost certainly took place – another complication – only one of the hominin species from any given epoch is our actual forebear; the others are our forebear’s cousins, you might say. For purely statistical reasons, we are far more likely to dig up bones from these cousins, who did not give rise to us, than from the rare species that did. In communicating their findings to the lay public, palaeoanthropologists often speak of finding human “ancestors”, but, unless they are referring to the genus , that is only shorthand. “In a pinch, it’s the sort of thing you can tell the media,” one researcher told me. But it isn’t, strictly speaking, true. ergeret never saw the femur, or any of her other research materials, again. “In hindsight, I wonder why I didn’t go back and say, ‘What happened to my fossils, actually?’” Bergeret told me. “But I was just a student.” The laboratory seemed to close ranks against her, she said, and after her master’s she was made to understand there was no support for her to take a doctorate. (Several members of the laboratory denied any campaign of exclusion, while acknowledging that individual members probably did behave unfairly toward her.) Macchiarelli intervened, and eventually helped her to become a museum conservator; she currently directs a natural history museum in Burgundy. (She now goes by the name Bergeret-Medina.) To her mind, Macchiarelli rescued her from the worst consequences of stumbling on the femur. “And in a way,” she said, “it damaged his career more than mine.” In Poitiers, Macchiarelli made overtures of reconciliation to the colleagues who felt him a traitor, he said, including a letter hoping for “a return to serenity”. But it didn’t work. Brunet’s group behaved “like a tribe, like a closed-off family”, he told me, like a “cult”. Brunet ought to have thanked him for bringing an important fossil to his attention, Macchiarelli thought. Instead, he urged administrators not to renew Macchiarelli’s contract. Macchiarelli’s office was relocated; he was forced to clean and supply it on his own, he said, and to buy his own stamps, printer cartridges and toilet paper. Though he remained a professor of the University of Poitiers, he took a research position in Paris. “I was attacked, I was insulted, I was threatened,” he said, of his time in Brunet’s group. “Poitiers is the asshole of the world.” At the same time, Brunet’s star continued to rise. In 2005, in collaboration with the researcher Christoph Zollikofer, he published a three-dimensional digital reconstruction of the Toumaï cranium, correcting for the various distortions it had suffered beneath the earth. “Now it’s completely confirmed that Toumaï is not a chimp, or a gorilla, but a true hominid,” Brunet said at the time. The same year, the prominent palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey declared Toumaï “the most important event” in the field in the past quarter-century. In 2007, Brunet was elected to the Collège de France – a tremendous honour for a French scientist – and soon thereafter published a new dating of the cranium, to between 6.8 and 7.2m years. was, in Brunet’s view, unequivocally the most ancient hominid species ever known, thrillingly close, in all likelihood, to the very moment our line began. The femur still haunted Macchiarelli, though. At the start, he’d dreamed about it feverishly. “I didn’t sleep for days,” he told me. “I replayed the film in my mind – I’d held it in my hands!” None of Brunet’s papers contained any reference to a recently discovered femur, however, and if one read closely, Macchiarelli realised, many of them seemed to implicitly deny its existence. A 2004 journal article reported an “absence of limb bone remains”. The following year, in Nature, Brunet wrote that “several lines of evidence” suggested that was bipedal, with the proviso that, in order to be certain, “postcranial evidence will be necessary”; he declined to report that he was now in possession of precisely such evidence. Macchiarelli at one point sent a long letter to the president of the University of Poitiers and several top officials at the CNRS, France’s prestigious research network, in order to “formally accuse” Brunet of lying about what he called “the femur affair”; nothing came of it. “There’s been a selection, a choosing of which remains to publish, and which not,” Macchiarelli told me. “No one has the right to do that!” Macchiarelli is a compact, voluble man with a winning smile and an endearing minor lisp. He bears a passing resemblance to the actor Dustin Hoffman. He is also a man of considerable self-regard and, by broad consensus, of sometimes unbearable, even aggressive, fastidiousness. Since childhood, his nickname has been “ ,” Italian for “anal-retentive”, he told me, not without pride. Typically it would be “ ”, the singular, but just one was deemed insufficient; Macchiarelli was more punctilious than that. “If a comma was missing, I was definitely the one who added it back,” he told me. As a teacher, he added, he sometimes drove students to tears, “even the boys”. As his concerns about the femur grew, Macchiarelli discovered further oddities. Beauvilain, the banished geographer, had his own fixation on , and beginning shortly after the discovery of the femur, in 2004, he had written several articles, in journals of varying degrees of obscurity, attempting to undermine the discovery of the Toumaï cranium itself. In 2009, in a French-language regional geological newsletter, he published photographs of the skull as he alleged it was found, atop the sand, surrounded by various other fossils. Just next to it, no more than about a foot away, was what looked very much like a femur. It had been there, it seemed, from the very start. Macchiarelli had initially assumed that Brunet was keeping silent about the femur for essentially emotional reasons, out of shame for not having been there for its discovery in the desert in 2001, and for not having recognised it afterward. By now, however, he had come to suspect that Brunet was in fact hiding it “because it didn’t fit”, he said – because it seemed to show that was not a biped, and presumably not a hominin at all, and because Brunet’s reputation would be shattered if anyone found out. Beauvilain’s photograph constituted the first public confirmation of the femur’s existence. It gave Macchiarelli an opening. In 2004, Bergeret had taken several laboratory photographs of the bone. Macchiarelli now brokered the publication of two of them on the widely read blog of John Hawks, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor and longtime sceptic. In principle, to print images of someone else’s unpublished fossil was a clear breach of ethics. But then, Macchiarelli, Bergeret and Hawks reasoned, after Beauvilain’s article, the femur was no longer unpublished. . They showed a small blackened shaft run through with fissures, ragged at the top and bottom, where the important end pieces had long since broken off. It resembled a length of burnt kindling. From the images alone it was impossible to say whether the bone had belonged to a biped, Hawks assessed. He called upon Brunet to make a formal description: measurements, scans, comparisons to other primates. It was “perfectly legitimate” for a scientist to delay addressing certain subjects “until you’re ready for the sun to shine on them”, Hawks wrote, but “some ideas need more sunshine than others”. runet likes to say, with only slight exaggeration, that it took him 30 years of digging before he found anything of consequence. Fieldwork is gruelling and slow, and always a gamble. In the 1970s he went to Afghanistan, prompted by the nearby discovery of , a 14m-year-old creature then thought to be a direct human ancestor. He was effectively deported after the Soviet invasion, in 1979; turned out to be an ancient orangutan. He went to Cameroon. No hominins had ever been found there. “It wouldn’t have been very innovative to try to follow the people who were already in east Africa,” he told me recently. A close friend came to help; he was killed by a drug-resistant strain of malaria. Brunet found nothing. Only then did he try Chad. The Djurab is a particularly difficult research environment. The zones of palaeontological interest typically require several full days of Jeep travel to reach; daytime temperatures can rise to about 50C. The winds whip stinging sand, and can sometimes cause a dune to migrate as much as 5 metres in a single night. Beneath the dunes lie compact sediments; when they are exposed, the winds erode them at a rate of a few centimetres per year. The fossils are left behind. Often they have been fully excavated by the wind, and come to rest gently upon the surface of the desert, strewn about and forgotten like the playthings of some primeval child. Eventually, inevitably, the winds cover them again with sand, if they do not destroy them first. In the Djurab, one must not only come to the right place, but arrive there at the right time. I visited Brunet last year in Poitiers, where he picked me up from the train. He’d suggested we meet at a parking garage attached to the station, the “Toumaï lot”; on the way there I passed the municipal conference centre, the “Espace Toumaï”. Brunet was waiting behind the wheel of an ageing Mercedes, looking over the reading glasses perched at the tip of his nose. He greeted me slowly, as if sceptical of my intentions, and then began to deplore the unsettled state of French society, and of science. “Sometimes I feel as if I come from another world,” he said. He is now 85. A white beard tapered to an elfin point beneath his chin, and bright cerulean eyes twinkled beneath the wisps of his eyebrows. When he emerged from the car, he took out a cane and began hobbling away. He’d lost 7cm of height to the Djurab, he said; several years ago, after a heart attack, he’d had a defibrillator implanted, such devices being rare in the desert. He asked that I follow him. “It won’t be hard!” he laughed. No one has ever questioned his commitment. Brunet was furious at the publication of the photographs of the femur. “When these little young people who have only ever worked with CT scanners or at the synchrotron come tell you how the world works, but they’ve never once found an actual fossil of their own – well!” he told me. Whatever the methodological conflicts within palaeoanthropology, it is a matter of near-universal agreement that, for having put in the time and effort, and for having made the initial gamble to dig wherever they dug, the discoverer has the sacred and inviolable right to be first to study their fossils, and first to publish them. In practice, Brunet noted, this often means a wait of many years. Brunet told me he’d never sought to keep the femur “hidden”, exactly, and that he’d in fact known of it from the very start, since its discovery in the desert in 2001. He did falsely deny its existence, including in print, but, contrary to Macchiarelli’s assumption, this had nothing to do with what it showed about , he said. In Brunet’s opinion the femur obviously belonged to a bipedal hominin, but bipedalism in was already clear from the skull. “It only confirmed what you could prove without it,” he told me. He had attempted to keep the femur out of the public eye because it was quite a damaged, difficult specimen; he assumed, wrongly as it happened, that he would soon find other femora, and that these would make for a more conclusive publication. “I was too optimistic,” he said. As proof of this version of events, Brunet offered that in 2001 or 2002, well before the bone turned up in Poitiers, he’d in fact taken the fossil or a cast to the United States, where he showed it to four prominent palaeoanthropologists: C Owen Lovejoy of Kent State, David Pilbeam of Harvard, Tim White of Berkeley, and Bernard Wood of George Washington. “Ask them!” Brunet said. When I did, three of the men said they had no recollection of seeing a femur at the time in question, though two did recall seeing one a few years later; one man, noting that he was a “close friend” of Brunet, declined to comment. When, in a later conversation, I brought these details to Brunet’s attention, he said he’d made a mistake about the timing but maintained that he had absolutely known about the femur from the outset. If that is true, he seems not to have made anyone else aware of it. Nor does he seem to have made any particular effort to keep it safe. On the contrary, for Bergeret’s study, he’d authorised that it be cut in half. His former colleagues tend to believe that Brunet did in fact see the fossil in 2001, when he came to N’Djamena to collect the cranium, but that he failed to realise what it was. Beauvilain told me he’d pointed it out to Brunet specifically – “Wait, what about that thing? Isn’t that something curious?” – but that Brunet seemed uninterested. Jean-Renaud Boisserie, a CNRS senior researcher who worked with Brunet for many years, recalled that Brunet was “consumed by the skull” when it was found, “completely staggered”. “I don’t think he was in a state of mind to examine any other fossils,” Boisserie said. Brunet was almost certainly also preoccupied with shaping the story of how the skull had been found, his colleagues said. Franck Guy, a palaeoanthropologist at the CNRS and the University of Poitiers and, like Boisserie, a former disciple of Brunet, said Brunet would have had a “dual reaction” to the discovery of the cranium on an unauthorised, wildcat expedition. “The first reaction is, ‘This Beauvilain asshole has once again taken a shit in my boots! And now I’m going to have make sure the shit doesn’t get out of them.’” (Initially, Brunet agreed to speak with me only if I agreed never to speak with Beauvilain; the articulation of this demand was complicated by his refusal to speak Beauvilain’s name aloud.) The second reaction, according to Guy – no less consuming or obsessional than the first – would have been: “Holy shit, we’ve clearly got the oldest hominid. We licked all those other fucking bastards!” fter Hawks’s 2009 blogpost, Brunet felt enormous pressure to make a formal description of the femur, and resented it. Toward the end of that year, during a presentation in London at the Royal Society, at a conference attended by many of the field’s biggest names, he addressed the audience angrily at one point. “My feeling is that you are thinking about postcrania!” Brunet said, his voice rising nearly to a shout. (In a recording of the talk, one can hear what sounds like a hand pounding on the dais.) Before his assembled peers, he declined to confirm or deny the existence of a femur. But he promised: “A description of postcrania is coming.” No description came. Brunet seemed to take the demands for publication as an attempt at a putsch, his colleagues told me, an intolerable effort to wrest away control of a fossil that, to his mind, would still be buried in the Djurab but for the research programme he founded. And though he was spending ever more time in Paris, at the Collège de France, Brunet still made chaos in Poitiers. Guy told me that two major studies on – one on the geochemistry of the cranium, the other on the were conducted at the time. The results of both were broadly in line with Brunet’s pre-existing ideas, but neither were ever published. In both cases, Brunet had gotten into disputes with his coauthors, including disputes about authorship credit, and no solution could be found. “Everything was always suffused with this extreme feeling of, ‘I’m the boss around here,’” Guy said. At the start, Guy and his colleagues had essentially aligned themselves with Brunet in the femur conflict. In their view, Macchiarelli had behaved with wild disregard to ethics at least twice: first in 2004, when he examined the Chadian fossils without authorisation, and then in 2009, when he helped arrange for the publication of the photos of the femur. But Brunet himself was becoming increasingly unbearable, they felt: the behaviour they might have accepted as subordinate graduate students was no longer tolerable as professional peers. And his continued refusal to publish a description of the femur was damaging the reputation of the research group in Poitiers. Guy and Boisserie, who rose to positions of leadership there in Brunet’s absence, began to insist that he publish the femur. He was unmoved. At the same time, Macchiarelli’s preoccupation with the unpublished femur seemed only to intensify. “For years, I thought about it every day,” he told me. He wrote repeatedly to university administrators to remind them of what he called the “ ” – the erasure from official history – to which the fossil had been condemned, to alert them to the “growing scepticism” of non-French researchers, and to warn that he might have no recourse but to go to the media. And he began to press Brunet’s former disciples, though they were, in his view, still in thrall to their mentor. “It was still him pulling the strings,” Macchiarelli ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
old me. “I didn’t for one second believe in their good faith.” (Guy described this pressure – which took the form of long, rather pontifical emails with the university leadership copied in, or disparaging comments to outside colleagues at academic conferences – as “harassment.”) Eventually, Macchiarelli had had enough of waiting. “From 2004 to 2018, as one says in proper French, ” – “I shut my trap” – Macchiarelli told me. “In 2018, I decided it wasn’t worth it any more.” The research group in Poitiers was hosting a major palaeontological conference that year. With Bergeret, Macchiarelli submitted an abstract for a presentation in which, using Bergeret’s photographs and measurements from 2004, they would finally describe the femur. It was, he acknowledged, a violation of the norms of his field. “Perhaps another researcher would not have done it,” Macchiarelli told me, lauding what he considered to be his “act of courage.” His was the role of the “white knight”, he said. The proposal was refused by the conference’s scientific committee. “Never in my life have I had another abstract rejected,” Macchiarelli told me. In a letter to the presidents of the University of Poitiers and the CNRS, among other recipients, he warned that the rejection threatened “the international credibility of French palaeoanthropological research.” He also spoke to the press. Two days before the conference opened, Nature published a news story that began, “When anthropologists meet in France at the end of January, one of the most provocative fossils in the study of human evolution will not feature on the agenda.” One conference participant told Le Figaro: “There hasn’t been a formal session on Toumaï. But it’s the only thing being talked about at all the coffee breaks!” The conference’s scientific committee insisted that Macchiarelli’s abstract had been rejected for ordinary reasons – other abstracts had been rejected, too – but there were, Le Monde reported, “suspicions of omertà”. For the researchers in Poitiers, the coverage was a catastrophe. “We were going to show that we’ve changed leadership, that we’re making a new start,” Guy told me. They were just beginning to emerge from what they considered to be the sinkhole around Brunet; Macchiarelli pulled them back in. or outsiders, the bitterness and intractability of the femur dispute was sometimes mystifying. The University of Poitiers attempted a mediated solution, and at one early meeting the university’s vice-president for research remarked that Macchiarelli “seems a bit frustrated not to be able to study this specimen”, Guy recalled; “Just give it to him,” the administrator suggested. Guy, a generous but brooding man with a shaved head and an air of unmistakable weariness – weariness with Macchiarelli, with Brunet, with being stuck between them, with how puerile science sometimes is – noted ruefully that the vice-president was a physicist by training. “We had to explain to all these people how things work within our discipline,” he told me. Eventually, however, an agreement was reached. The researchers in Poitiers would, with Brunet’s approval, finally publish a formal study of the femur. In the meantime, and until publication, Macchiarelli would stop talking about it in public. Macchiarelli broke the agreement. In November 2020, in the Journal of Human , or JHE, one of the top publications in the field, he, Bergeret, and two co-authors published their own formal description of the femur, the first ever made. Based largely upon the bone’s apparent forward curvature – in , the femur is effectively straight – and what little they could glean of its internal structure from Bergeret’s photos, the authors concluded that it had probably belonged to a quadrupedal, non-hominin ape. Without access to the fossil itself, the paper was “mediocre”, Macchiarelli acknowledged. But it was beyond time for a formal description: without one, he felt, the entire field was being misled, our vision of humanity itself distorted. The year before, a respected colleague in the US had published a paper in which he referred to in definitive terms as a “hominin” and the “earliest species known.” “If he’d seen the femur, he wouldn’t have written the things he wrote!” Macchiarelli said. And he assumed that, despite the agreement, Guy and his colleagues had no plans to publish. “I waited, I waited, I waited,” he told me. Even given Macchiarelli’s history, the researchers in Poitiers were astonished at what he had done. He had now, irrevocably, made the first formal description of a specimen that he had not himself discovered and to which he had never actually been granted access, including by the ultimate rights-holders, the authorities of Chad. Nor had Macchiarelli in fact been quite so unaware of any plans to publish. Two months before the appearance of the JHE article, the scientists in Poitiers had posted a preprint manuscript of their own study online; Macchiarelli had seen it, he acknowledged to me. He went ahead with his own article anyway. The researchers in Poitiers wrote to the JHE to warn that Macchiarelli’s paper was “presumably subject to scientific integrity issues”. They also filed a formal ethics complaint with the CNRS. Neither undertaking had much effect. “We understand how upsetting this is for you,” the editors of the JHE responded. After more than 70 hours of interviews, a CNRS investigatory committee determined that it would make no pronouncement on Macchiarelli’s behaviour. In their brief report, they offered no specific logic for sitting on their hands but did make note, with apparent apprehension, of “the potentially media-attracting character of this affair”. The researchers pressed on with the femur. Their finalised study was published in Nature in 2022, 20 years after the Toumaï cranium first appeared in the pages of the same journal. Brunet was not among the authors, and told me he had declined to participate out of lassitude with the “polemic” around the femur. According to Guy and Boisserie, he had in fact demanded to be credited as lead author, and had withdrawn his name when they refused. It was the end of cordial relations. Guy put the conflict in Oedipal terms. It had taken them many years, he said, but he and his colleagues were finally able to “kill the father”. Brunet now calls them “the young ones” – Guy and Boisserie are in their 50s – or the “little idiots”. For the Nature study, Guy and his co-authors had measured the femur and two ulnae – bones of the forearm – across a total of 23 distinct parameters, working from high-resolution scans. The “most parsimonious hypothesis”, they concluded, was that was indeed a habitual biped, albeit one that probably engaged in a good deal of “arboreal clambering”. It would have been a flat-faced, small-brained creature about the size of a human child or small chimpanzee, perhaps scampering into the trees when a saber-toothed cat came round, perhaps hanging on branches, perhaps sleeping in nests as modern apes do, and presumably moving about much of the rest of the time on the ground, where it walked on two feet. Brunet felt vindicated. Whatever his relations with the authors, “they did an excellent paper”, he said. was bipedal, then bipedality was in all likelihood a marker of the human lineage from the start. In combination with our distinctive “non-honing” dentition, it was a possible “synapomorphic signature of the hominin clade”, the authors wrote: a functional definition of what it is and always has been to be human. “I don’t want to say we’re categorical about that idea,” said the researcher Guillaume Daver, who shared lead authorship with Guy, but “we have no evidence to contradict it”. Humankind: small dull teeth, two legs. acchiarelli called the paper out of Poitiers a “fairytale”. When I asked about its methodology, he chided me, “Please be serious.” (When I asked how such a ridiculous paper had been selected for publication in a top scientific journal, he alleged that, when it came to , Nature could not be trusted. The magazine had published the Toumaï cranium 20 years before and other papers since; it was now committed, he claimed, to showing that the species was bipedal.) Last year, in the JHE, Macchiarelli published a response, reaching conclusions that were precisely the inverse. When I spoke with his co-author Clément Zanolli, he offered a wry compromise with the findings of the Nature paper. “It’s not impossible that could have used bipedalism,” Zanolli, a CNRS researcher and former student of Machiarelli, told me. “Just like chimpanzees do occasionally today.” In the view of other palaeoanthropologists, the interpretive approaches of both papers were in fact entirely reasonable. Yet by the laws of formal logic, at least one of them was wrong. We have grown accustomed to seeing this sort of scientific impasse resolved through improvements in technology: a new tool makes it possible to extract the pivotal data that had once been inaccessible. But it is hard to imagine pulling much more morphological information from the femur. For their study, the researchers in Poitiers scanned it via micro-CT a total of 5,984 times, resulting in 4,962 “slices”. Every feature of the bone as small as the width of a human hair was recorded in three dimensions. Such exquisite accuracy is of obvious value, but it is also deceptive in a way; in the palaeoanthropological context, it is perhaps even slightly absurd. The defining problem in palaeoanthropology is not one of precision; the problem is that, because we know so extraordinarily little of our deepest past, we can only guess at the meaning of the measurements we already have, however precise they may be. The Sahelanthropus femur is the only possibly hominin lower limb bone ever recovered from before 6m years ago. Without anything contemporaneous to compare it with, even the premise that the fossil being studied in such incredible detail belongs to Sahelanthropus, and not to some other animal, is itself no more than a hypothesis. The maddening irony is that the same scarcity of evidence that makes the femur so important and so tantalising also makes it all but impossible to interpret with any meaningful degree of certainty. “The basic need in this field,” the palaeoanthropologist Tim White told me, expressing a position of rare consensus in the discipline, “is the recovery of new fossils.” Slowly, as more remains come to light, certain questions will be answered. Others will not be, and cannot be. The question of the true nature of , and of its relation to us, may be of that latter, insoluble category. “Just because you to know something, it doesn’t mean you know it,” said the palaeoanthropologist Bernard Wood. If is indeed a hominin, statistics all but rule out the possibility that it is an actual human ancestor. The most that can be said is that it “represents humanity as it might have been 7m years ago,” Guy said: that it came into being according to the same evolutionary pressures that made our ancestor, whoever it was. We will almost certainly never find fossils from that ancestor, and in truth we wouldn’t know it if we did. We could one day hold in our hands the remains of the literal ur-mother, the individual animal that birthed the whole of human history. There is no technology, extant or imaginable, that could extract that marvellous secret from her bones. ossils promise untold knowledge; fossils promise worldly fame. Often they withhold both; sometimes they drive people mad. They do stir up “an irrational element”, Macchiarelli acknowledged. But as a responsible scientist, adding careful bricks to the great edifice of learned wisdom, he said he had never been swayed by such human passions. “I’m not on a crusade!” he told me, in regards to . “I simply think the femur is not at all compatible with bipedality.” Brunet prefers to ascribe Macchiarelli’s two-decade preoccupation with the femur to jealousy. “And jealousy,” Brunet is fond of saying, “is a disease with no cure.” (“Impossible!” Macchiarelli retorted: “for inexplicable reasons”, jealousy “is not part” of his psychological repertoire.) The Toumaï fossils seem to cause a certain derangement, Brunet went on: “Everyone who’s come near Toumaï, who’s touched it – it’s gone to their head.” Like his antagonist, he seemed to imagine himself exempt. Lately Brunet has turned his eye to chimps. For reasons no one entirely understands, the remains of ancient panins are much rarer even than the fossils of ancient hominins. “Three teeth, a femur – ,” Daver told me. They would be of tremendous use in identifying and understanding the species of our own line, a sort of Rosetta Stone. If we cannot know ourselves by what we were, we can know ourselves by what we were not. Brunet has been digging for them in Cameroon. He would like to return to the Djurab. His former disciples now control the research programme there, however, and they have prevented him: he has a habit of creating problems for them in Chad, as elsewhere. He also seems to have a plan to die in the desert, I was told repeatedly. His former students do not wish to take on the moral burden of allowing him to carry out this plan, or the logistical burden of the aftermath. Repatriating a cadaver is never straightforward, one researcher pointed out drily," but the desert can be especially capricious with human remains. and sign up to the long read weekly email""",Scott Sayare

We asked experts for their top home experiments to challenge friends and family. Matthew Cobb, a professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, suggests picking a sweet such as a jellybean and, with your eyes shut and holding your nose, putting it in your mouth and chewing, keeping your mouth shut. “See if you can tell what the sweet tastes of – you will probably just say ‘sweet’ and maybe have a vague idea of something else,” says Cobb. “After five seconds, take your fingers off your nose and you should get a sudden rush of sensation that enables you to correctly identify the flavour.” A more extreme version of this experiment, he says, involves grating an onion and an apple, separately, then tasting each on a spoon with your eyes shut and your nose firmly held. “They should taste the same – until you take your fingers off your nose.” Cobb says such experiments show how flavour largely consists of smell, not taste. “When we chew, the volatile smells emitted by the food go up into our nose via the back of our mouth, where they stimulate our olfactory neurons,” he says, adding that it is the combination of taste and smell that produces flavour. “Without smell, things don’t taste of much. We all discovered this during the first outbreak of Covid, when people temporarily lost their sense of smell.” With crackers a staple of Christmas, Sophie Scott, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London suggests experimenting to see what can influence whether or not people laugh at a (terrible) joke. “First, try reading those jokes to yourself and see if you laugh at any of them,” she says. “Second, read the jokes to someone else – maybe a room full of people.” Scott says to look and see if anyone laughs – including you – when you get to the punchline, or if they respond in some other way such as groaning. She notes that although we associate laughter with jokes and humour, we laugh mainly for social reasons. “You are 30 times more likely to laugh if there is someone else with you than if you are on your own,” she says. “What this means for cracker jokes is that a joke read by someone alone is much less likely to make them laugh than the same joke read – or heard – in company. And laughter is amplified by social connection, so the more you know and like the people that you are with, the more laughter there will be.” If you are having a turkey or another bird for your Christmas meal then take time to explore the carcass. “We did a Thanksgiving dinner a few weeks ago and I got an enormous turkey, cooked the thing for a few hours, basted it lovingly every 30 minutes or so,” says Steve Brusatte, a professor of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh. “Mostly so it would be delicious, but also so the meat would fall off the bone well enough that I could remove the bones and show my wife and my six-year-old boy the shoulder area.” That allowed Brusatte to demonstrate how the various bones fit together to move the wing up and down, and how the huge springy wishbone stores energy as the wings beat. “This is a simple thing that you can do with a roast turkey or chicken – actually look at the bones and understand how they fit together and move, and that gives a better understanding of biomechanics and flight motions than I’ve ever seen in any textbook during my many years of study,” he says. “And then you get a delicious meal afterwards.” Prof Sue Black, a forensic anthropologist, anatomist and academic at the University of Oxford, also recommends dissecting the festive bird to understand the anatomy of motion. “Boil the carcass so that only the bones are left and you have a 3D jigsaw to reconstruct,” she says. Salt is commonly spread on pavements in the winter and there is a simple experiment that can help to explain why. “You will need 500ml of full-fat milk or cream, five egg yolks and 125g of sugar. A bit of vanilla never goes amiss,” says Andrea Sella, a professor of inorganic chemistry at UCL. “Whisk them together and then warm almost to the boil until the mixture starts to thicken. Let it cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, get some ice from the freezer. Either bash it, like an alchemist, with a mortar and pestle, or grind it up in a blender like a modernist.” Next, he says, take two plastic bags – ideally zippable ones. “Drop some of your crushed ice into one and add generous amount of salt. Into the second, spoon some of your custard mixture, adding sprinkles, nuts or bits of fruit. Seal the [second bag] and put it into the first. “Now mash the ice and salt together, and the custard in the bag. The temperature will plunge, to -10C or even lower. In seconds you’ll have ice-cream, a soft (and delicious) solid.” Sella says this happens because the dissolved salt prevents liquid water molecules, produced as the ice melts, from freezing back on to the remaining ice. “So the ice keeps melting and steals heat from the custard (and your fingers),” he says. “It’s practical magic – also known as science.” “One of the most surprising little science experiments you can do at home is called Buffon’s Needle, but for festive purposes let’s call it Buffon’s Pine Needles. It’s a way of approximating the value of ϖ,” says Kit Yates, a professor of mathematical biology and public engagement at the University of Bath. First off, grab a bunch of pine needles and select as many as you can that are roughly the same length ( “Let’s say you manage to find a total ( of similar-sized pine needles. You’re going to also need a piece of paper that has lines ruled on it which are a distance apart – further apart than the length of your needles,” Yates says. Scatter the pine needles, without aiming, on top of your piece of ruled paper and then count the number of needles that cross one of the lines. This number is Once you have counted, you can find your approximation of ϖ by plugging your numbers into this formula: ϖ ≈ 2 “What I love about this is that it demonstrates how ϖ seems to crop up in really unusual places,” Yates says. “It feels almost like magic, but it’s just probability in action on your living room floor.”",Nicola Davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The family of Matthew Upham issued a tribute to him on the Instagram account of his , saying he was “deeply loved and forever missed”. Emergency services were called to Budleigh Salterton at 10.25am after concerns were raised for people in the water. A number of people were safely brought to shore but two men – one in his 40s and another in his 60s – could not be found. Of the people who were rescued, two were checked by paramedics and one was taken by ambulance to hospital as a precaution. In a statement posted on Upham’s Instagram account, his family said: “Our family is heartbroken by the loss of our beloved family member Matthew Upham, who was reported missing on Christmas morning. “Matthew is deeply loved and will be forever missed. “We would like to express our sincere and heartfelt thanks to the emergency services who responded, particularly the RNLI and coastguard, for their dedication, professionalism, and tireless efforts during this extremely difficult time. “We are profoundly grateful for their compassion and support.As we grieve and support one another, we kindly ask that our family’s privacy is respected. “We thank everyone for their understanding, kindness, and condolences.” Upham, from Budleigh Salterton, ran an antiques business called Matthew Upham Antiques in the Devon town. A coastguard search for the two men has been called off. On Boxing Day, police said both men were still missing. A spokesperson added: “Police inquiries are ongoing. A police presence remains at the scene.” The coastguard stopped searching the water at 5pm but police said onshore inquiries continued into the evening. The men’s families had been informed. While there is no official weather warning in place on Boxing Day, some sea swims have been cancelled and police in Devon and Cornwall have urged people not to get into the water. On Christmas Day, Det Supt Hayley Costar, of Devon and Cornwall police, said officers had responded to “a truly tragic incident” in Budleigh Salterton. “Our thoughts remain firmly with the families and friends of the two men who are currently missing and to all who may have witnessed and be impacted by the incident,” she said. “There have been weather warnings in place this week and a number of official and unofficial swims have already been cancelled. While there are no official warnings in place for tomorrow, we urge anyone with plans to go swimming in the sea on Boxing Day not to.” The coastguard said its search was stood down at 5pm. A spokesperson said: “Alerted at around 10am, Exmouth and Beer coastguard rescue teams, RNLI lifeboats from Exmouth, Teignmouth and Torbay, coastguard search and rescue helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were sent to the scene to assist, alongside police and ambulance service. “Searches have continued throughout the day to find two men believed to still be in the water. After extensive shoreline and offshore searches, the coastguard part of the search was stood down at 5pm.” Julia Robb, a resident who had been watching swimmers at the beach before the men went missing, said it had been a “very cold and windy” day and the waves “would have been at least 6ft”. She said it was only when she heard helicopters it became clear something was wrong. Robb added: “It was a sad thing to happen on what had been such a positive morning. I just feel sorry for those who have been affected. I think it will be shocking for the whole community. We are a small town. People are very friendly. I think it is important to think of the friends and families of those who have been affected.”",Alexandra Topping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The action against five Europeans who are taking on harmful content and the platforms that host it has had an inevitable feel to it, given the increasingly vociferous reactions to the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). Both pieces of legislation require social media firms to protect users or . Indeed, Elon Musk’s X has been fined €120m (£105m) this month for These acts are prime examples of what US Republicans see as an anti-free speech culture on the other side of the Atlantic. Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator charged with overseeing the OSA, has not been affected by the visa bans announced on Christmas Eve, but there is an implicit threat in the air. One of those targeted by the move is the former European industry commissioner Thierry Breton, an architect of the DSA. The message is clear: watch out regulators. Trump allies have also targeted Imran Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a US-UK organisation which campaigns against online hate speech. Ahmed was one of the people who received a visa ban on Wednesday. CCDH was the target of an Elon Musk lawsuit in 2023 but the claim was thrown out by a judge last year who said the , which focused on allegations that CCDH accessed data on X illegally, was in fact “about punishing the defendants for their speech”. In a post on X, Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”, described CCDH as a “truly evil organization that just wants to destroy the first amendment under the guise of doing good!” . JD Vance, the US vice-president, has said free speech in the UK is “in retreat”. In July, Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman who has criticised the act, led a delegation of US politicians to discuss the legislation with the Labour government and Ofcom is aware it could be in the crosshairs. In May, the state department announced it will to “foreign nationals who censor Americans”. The watchdog has said it is seeking “clarity” on the planned visa restrictions. The EU and UK have only just got going on implementing their acts and, as the visa ban for Breton shows, opposition is building. In October, Ofcom fined the online forum 4chan £20,000 for breaching the act by failing to respond to a request for a risk assessment. Emboldened by domestic opposition to the OSA, 4chan is suing Ofcom in the US, claiming its enforcement of the OSA violates Americans’ right to freedom of speech. The UK government has said it won’t back down on the OSA, while the X fine signals the EU is determined to enforce its own legislation.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/26/foreign-medics-shunning-nhs-anti-migrant-rhetoric,"Foreign medics shunning NHS because of anti-migrant rhetoric, says top doctor",2025-12-26T20:00:17.000Z,"Exclusive: UK an ‘unwelcoming, racist’ country for overseas health workers, according to medical colleges leader Foreign doctors and nurses are increasingly shunning the because anti-migrant rhetoric and rising racism have created “a hostile environment”, the leader of Britain’s medics has warned. The health service is being put at risk because overseas health professionals increasingly see the UK as an “unwelcoming, racist” country, in part because of the government’s tough approach to immigration, Jeanette Dickson said. and the post-Brexit surge in those coming to work in it has stalled. At the same time, the number of nurses and midwives joining the NHS Dickson is the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the professional interests of the UK and Ireland’s 220,000 doctors, including GPs, surgeons, anaesthetists and A&E specialists. She said that without the contribution of foreign doctors and nurses the NHS “could quite easily fall over” and find itself without “a critical mass of people there to run the service safely”. Foreign-born doctors and nurses were being put off by antagonism by politicians towards migrants, media coverage of immigration, the racist abuse of international medical graduates by NHS colleagues and racist aggression by patients toward minority ethnic NHS staff, she said. “My feeling is we are creating a culture where the rhetoric is ‘foreigner bad’. If you have never visited Britain and are looking at our media, the social media, press media, print media, what our politicians are reported as saying, I think that it’s not unreasonable to see that as a hostile environment,” Dickson, an NHS consultant clinical oncologist, told the Guardian. “Because [foreign health staff] see Britain retreating from Europe, ‘we can go it alone’. They see attacks on synagogues, they see anti-Muslim protests. They see the rhetoric that immigration is bad, [that] immigration is a major problem for the country. “Why would you go somewhere where people are going, ‘we don’t need you, we don’t want you’? For them that makes Britain appear unwelcoming, racist. The prevalence of it [hostility to migrants] is significantly more [than] 10 years ago.” While the NHS has relied on overseas staff since its creation in 1948, this dependence has reached its greatest extent. For example, 42% of all UK doctors qualified abroad, The atmosphere in the UK towards migrants is now so unpleasant that some foreign-born NHS staff feel unsafe in their everyday lives, Dickson added. Selina Douglas, the chief executive of the Whittington health trust in London, told a public meeting last month that hospital and community-based staff were experiencing a rise in racism. Referring to overseas nurses who have worked here for 25 years, Douglas said: “Those staff are being racially abused in our hospital. I have had staff spat at walking up the hill [from the tube station].” In a warning to abusive patients, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said last month that “your right to access free healthcare in this country does not come with the freedom to abuse our staff on any grounds”. However, it is unclear what action NHS trusts or the police take against abuse by patients. Workforce data collected by the GMC and the and Midwifery Council show that more and more foreign medical and nursing graduates are “voting with their feet” by either not coming to the UK or leaving to work elsewhere, Dickson said. She voiced her concerns at the end of a year in which Streeting has said NHS staff are and an NHS trust leader expressed alarm that Black and Asian staff visiting patients’ homes had been “deliberately intimidated” She claimed that the Labour government was partly to blame for doctors deciding not to come to Britain because it was prioritising UK medical graduates over those who qualified overseas in the allocation of places in specialist medical training. This is a key issue alongside pay in the in England between ministers and the British Medical Association. That may prove shortsighted, Dickson suggested, given that there was a global shortage of doctors, who can earn more money and enjoy easier working lives outside the UK. She added: “You have a population who have retreated from internationalism through Brexit. There is a secretary of state who is also saying ‘we would prioritise UK graduates for jobs’. “There’s always been a cohort [of doctors] who’ve gone back to their country of origin or another country. More worryingly to me [is] the number of overseas graduates who wanted to enter the country is diminishing as well. And I think that’s partly about the prioritisation argument that’s being pushed forward. “Doctors have a lot of portable skills, as do nurses. There’s an international shortage [of both]. If the country is not looking as welcoming, or people don’t feel as safe, and Canada, Australia and New Zealand are opening their doors more, then I find it unsurprising that people are leaving.” Anti-migrant sentiment expressed by unnamed politicians could prompt so many overseas staff to quit that the NHS “could quite easily fall over”, she warned. “If we have significant outward migration, and continue with the rhetoric nationally that immigration is bad and also ‘we’re prioritising UK graduates’, then I do worry about us coming to a point of not having a critical mass of people there to run the service safely.” She said Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and Streeting should make clear to the public that foreign-born frontline NHS doctors and nurses were welcome because “they provide an invaluable service to patients but also to the NHS and their colleagues, because without them we’d all be completely snowed under. The ones who are already in the UK, we absolutely need to make them feel welcome and go out of our way to make them feel welcome”. Responding to Dickson’s remarks, a spokesperson for the Department of and Social Care said: “The NHS benefits hugely from its international staff, and we’ll continue to support and attract talented overseas staff who want to dedicate their time, energy and skills to the health service. “Discrimination against patients and staff alike undermines everything our health service stands for – and the NHS has a zero tolerance for racism.” They added: “However, a failure to train enough medical professionals has left us reliant on international recruitment to plug the gaps. It’s only right that British taxpayers should see a return on the investment they make in training homegrown medical talent which is why our 10-year health plan commits to prioritising UK medical graduates and others who have worked in the NHS for significant periods for speciality training roles.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

In November, in a joint interview with the Guardian alongside the England chief executive, Jim Mackey, Wes Streeting said he had been “shocked” hearing NHS staff, especially those working in A&E, recount growing levels of harassment, aggression and violence when their care gets delayed. “Even if you’ve got a long wait, which I know is frustrating, or you feel like you’ve been sent from pillar to post, which sadly does happen, there’s no excuse for taking that out on staff,” Streeting said. “But the thing that has shocked me most of all is that the rising tide of racism and the way in which kind of 1970s, 1980s-style racism has apparently become permissible again in this country.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/25/king-charles-reconciliation-unity-christmas-message,King Charles calls for reconciliation and unity in Christmas message,2025-12-25T15:10:42.000Z,"Monarch urges people to draw strength from community diversity after a year marked by division and violence King Charles has called for reconciliation after a year of deepening division, saying in his address that people must find strength in the diversity of their communities to ensure right defeats wrong. The monarch cited the spirit of the second world war generation, which he said came together to take on the challenge that faced them; displaying qualities he said have shaped both the UK and the Commonwealth. The king said: “The end of the second world war is now remembered by fewer and fewer of us, as the years pass. But the courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and women, and the way communities came together in the face of such great challenge, carry a timeless message for us all. “These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth. As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.” In the wake of the Bondi beach shooting and the Manchester synagogue attack, Charles also praised the “spontaneous bravery” of those who put themselves in “harm’s way to defend others”. The king referenced the impact new technologies can have on wellbeing and community cohesion as the world spins “ever faster”, suggesting the festive period might be a moment to recharge and for those communities to grow stronger. The annual broadcast is written by the king and is the rare occasion when he does not consult government. King Charles is said to see his role as helping to build bridges between communities, faith groups and others – seeking to portray himself a part of society, not apart from it. He praised the qualities of “resilience in the face of adversity; peace through forgiveness; simply getting to know our neighbours and, by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships”. He added: “Indeed, as our world seems to spin ever faster, our journeying may pause, to quieten our minds – in TS Eliot’s words ‘at the still point of the turning world’ – and allow our souls to renew. “In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he said, adding that people “need to cherish the values of compassion and reconciliation”. The broadcast showed Charles at Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, where he visited survivors of the October terror attack and met those who blocked the doors as a knife-wielding assailant tried to get in. An arch in Sydney, in Australia, with the words Bondi beach was seen in footage followed by hundreds of floral tributes left after two gunmen targeted a Jewish festival, killing 15 people. The widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, the Syrian-born immigrant Ahmed al-Ahmed, was shot after wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen. An aide to the king said: “I think his majesty hopes that, if nothing else, Christmas might afford a moment when people could experiment with something of a digital detox to focus more on our friendships, our families and our faith for those who practise. “In this way, the king hopes our minds may find greater peace, our souls can renew, and our communities grow stronger.” The address, recorded on 11 December in Westminster Abbey’s Lady Chapel, made no reference to Charles’s recent “good news” announcement about reducing his cancer treatment, reflecting his wish for his message to mirror society’s experiences during the past 12 months. There was a strong religious element in the address to the nation and Commonwealth from the king; of which the key theme was pilgrimage, and he emphasised the biblical journeys made by Mary and Joseph, arriving “homeless” in Bethlehem, and the three wise men and shepherds to pay homage to the baby Jesus. The king said: “Journeying is a constant theme of the Christmas story. The holy family made a journey to Bethlehem and arrived homeless without proper shelter. “The wise men made a pilgrimage from the east to worship at the cradle of Christ; and the shepherds journeyed from field to town in search of Jesus, the saviour of the world. In each case, they journeyed with others, and relied on the companionship and kindness of others. Through physical and mental challenge, they found an inner strength.”",Kevin Rawlinson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country’s woodland cover is and the government aims to increase this to at least 16.5% of all land in England by 2050. A garden demonstrating this approach will be unveiled at the will represent a damaged ancient woodland, transitioning from a dark, monoculture conifer forest to a regenerated, thriving ancient woodland. Her design will include “indicator” plants that can be used to identify ancient woodlands such as wild service tree and red campion. only 7% of the UK’s native woodland is in good condition, with drastic knock-on effects for the wildlife that make these trees their home. Though her garden will be an ambitious demonstration of recreating an ancient woodland, there are lessons that can be taken from it for all those with a green space at home, such as planting small native trees and “tredges”. Mark Gush, the RHS’s head of environmental horticulture, said: “Often found in ancient woodlands, a top choice for gardeners seeking a small tree is . It is a great example of a ‘tredge’, which can be both a standalone tree or a hedge. “It strikes the perfect balance between beauty and functionality. With attractive foliage, flowers and haws, it is also resilient to wet and dry climate extremes, tolerant of clay soils, and there is research evidence to show that this genus is effective at capturing pollutants from busy roads in summer. Its thorny protective canopy supports biodiversity and helps alleviate flooding risks from summer thunder-showers through effective water uptake.” The Woodland Trust is trying to make tree-planting more accessible for those who have small spaces and are worried about giant trees dwarfing their gardens. Native trees do not need to be large. Planting a small native species could provide spring blossom and plentiful autumn berries, without taking up much space. Diverse trees also provide benefits to the garden because different species have different root architecture, which improves the health and structure of the soil. Aylett’s garden will also demonstrate “forest planting”, showing layered canopies, ranging from ground covers to herbaceous perennials, shrubs and trees of various sizes, which has the benefit of maximising species diversity in limited spaces, and providing protective benefits against climate extremes (hot and cold) offered by this approach. Transitional gardening, where multiple different habitats give way to each other and have diverse borders in between, is a good way to emulate ancient woodland habitat at home, Gush said. He added: “Woodland edges support some of the highest levels of biodiversity because they represent an ‘ecotone’ – a transition zone between different environments. Ecotones between two habitats are often richer in species than either. This is a concept that can be applied incredibly successfully to domestic gardens where ecotones abound – lawns to borders, borders to shrubs and trees, pond edges and more. Think softer gradual transition as opposed to hard cutoff.” The RHS is encouraging gardeners to choose trees grown under the UKISG (UK and Ireland sourced and grown) scheme, which ensures they are raised from seed and helps prevent new pests and diseases from entering the country, one of the most significant threats to native trees. For smaller gardens, instead of fences or walls, they ask that people consider planting a native hedge. This allows people to include native species without needing a huge garden, while also providing valuable food and habitat for the wildlife that relies on them. After the show, the Woodland Trust garden will be relocated to Hawthorn primary school in Newcastle upon Tyne. The school is situated in an area with low tree cover, so will increase access to trees in a neighbourhood where canopy cover is limited. This article was amended on 26 December 2025. An earlier version said the UK’s woodland cover is approximately 10%; however, this percentage refers to England’s cover.",Helena Horton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/26/un-experts-raise-grave-concern-over-treatment-of-palestine-action-hunger-strikers,UN experts raise ‘grave concern’ over treatment of Palestine Action-linked hunger strikers,2025-12-26T18:03:18.000Z,"Special rapporteurs say handling of prisoners raises questions over UK’s obligations under human rights laws UN experts have expressed “grave concern” for the wellbeing of Palestine Action-affiliated hunger strikers and warned their treatment raises questions about the UK’s compliance with international human rights laws. Eight prisoners have been on hunger strike while awaiting trial for alleged offences relating to Palestine Action before the group was banned under terrorism legislation. Qesser Zuhrah, 20, and Amu Gib, 30, who are being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, were on hunger strike from 2 November to 23 December. Heba Muraisi, 31, who is at HMP New Hall, joined the pair on 3 November. The group also includes Teuta Hoxha, 29, Kamran Ahmed, 28, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day because he has diabetes. Zuhrah and Gib temporarily resumed eating on Tuesday evening, according to a statement released by the Prisoners for Palestine group, owing to deteriorating health, but vowed to resume the protest action next year. On Friday a group of UN experts including Gina Romero, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, issued a statement expressing alarm at the group’s treatment. “Hunger strike is often a measure of last resort by people who believe that their rights to protest and effective remedy have been exhausted. The state’s duty of care toward hunger strikers is heightened, not diminished,” the experts said. On Sunday, three of the prisoners – Zuhrah, Gib and Ahmed – were simultaneously in hospital. Ahmed has been admitted to hospital three times since going on hunger strike. The experts added: “Authorities must ensure timely access to emergency and hospital care when clinically indicated, refrain from actions that may amount to pressure or retaliation, and respect medical ethics.” Last week, Prisoners for Palestine, a prisoner-led collective in Britain, said the Prison Service was reported to have denied an ambulance entry into Bronzefield on Tuesday afternoon for Zuhrah, even though she was unable to stand and was writhing in pain on her cell floor. She was taken to hospital after protesters gathered outside the jail where she was being held to demand she receive urgent medical attention. “These reports raise serious questions about compliance with international human rights law and standards, including obligations to protect life and prevent cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” the experts said. “Preventable deaths in custody are never acceptable. The state bears full responsibility for the lives and wellbeing of those it detains,” they added. “Urgent action is required now.” On Monday, families and supporters of the hunger strikers pleaded with David Lammy, the justice secretary, to meet them as lawyers for the group sent a legal letter claiming that, by refusing a meeting, the justice secretary had failed to comply with the Ministry of Justice’s own policy on handling of hunger strikes. There is understood to be concern in government about the condition of the prisoners, but also extreme caution about setting a precedent even to facilitate a meeting with Lammy, given the number of prisoners who are forced to spend lengthy periods on remand because of the court backlog.",Sammy Gecsoyler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/23/foiled-plot-massacre-jews-greater-manchester,"‘My blood is boiling, brother’: the foiled plot to massacre Jews on streets of Greater Manchester",2025-12-23T13:57:28.000Z,"Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein thought ‘zero hour’ had finally arrived until undercover operative thwarted them When Walid Saadaoui recruited Amar Hussein to join him in a pogrom on the streets of For years, the two men had been sleeper agents for the Islamic State terrorist group. Each had lived quietly in Britain for years, waiting for the right moment to stage an attack, and for the right person to give them the support to make it happen. Now, finally, it seemed that “zero hour” – as they called it – had arrived. They planned to disguise themselves as Jews to infiltrate a march against antisemitism in Manchester city centre, before opening fire on the crowd with assault rifles. The pair hoped to throw emergency services into chaos by paying people to make 999 calls across Greater Manchester, allowing them to slip away and continue their attack in the suburbs at the centre of the region’s Jewish community. Saadaoui also planned to attack Christians, saying: “God willing … after we finish with the Jews … we move on to the crusaders.” It would have been, according to senior detectives, the worst terrorist attack the UK had ever seen. Both men envisaged being “martyred”, but neither reckoned with the prospect that a man they believed to be a crucial player in their plot could be a counter-terrorism undercover operative (UCO). Because of the courage of the UCO, known as “Farouk”, Saadaoui was captured in the final stages of preparation in a hotel car park, while Hussein was arrested at the shop where he worked. A prosecution source said of Saadaoui, the prime mover: “This was a man who was quite prepared to go out and kill children and leave his own in the process.” They added: “At one point he says: ‘You know, if we have an AK-47 left over, I will leave it for my son – so he can do what I do when he grows up.’” The disturbing mindset and tactics of the secret IS network of “lone wolves” and sympathisers were revealed in unprecedented detail in a forensic prosecution case laid out in a three month trial at Preston crown court. Now that Saadaoui, 38, and Hussein, 52, have been convicted of preparing for acts of terrorism, and Saadaoui’s younger brother Bilel Saadaoui has been convicted of failing to report them, the full story of the plot can be told. On the surface, nothing about Saadaoui, a father of two, suggested he was an extremist who, in his own words, believed Adolf Hitler should be “exulted”. Originally from Tunisia, he was not known to police or security services, had never been referred to the Prevent anti-radicalisation scheme and had no criminal convictions. He came across as a personable, ambitious individual with little interest in religion, let alone extremism. Acquaintances in the UK knew him as a man who doted on his pet birds, dressed casually in sportswear and said he wasn’t a faithful Muslim. When he met his first wife, a British woman, he was working as an entertainer at a Tunisian resort, amusing tourists by the pool with jokes, fitness sessions and dance shows. The couple settled in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Saadaoui worked at a Haven holiday village, doing overtime in the resort’s shops, bakery and arcade, before training as a chef and buying an Italian restaurant, the Albatross, in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 2018. His marriage ended soon after moving there, and he went on to meet his second wife, with whom he he had two children. “I wanted to progress in life,” Saadaoui claimed seven years later, standing in the dock at court. “Walid Saadaoui told Farouk that [he and his brother Bilel] committed to Islamic State when they were young boys in Tunisia,” a prosecutor in the case told the Guardian. “And so that became a driving force for them. And by [the time they were] late teenagers, early 20s, they both got into the tourism industry and befriended English girls and married to come to the UK. They moved into the UK with a very ingrained Isis [IS] creed and conviction.” “Their partners were, without doubt, without knowledge of what was happening,” the source added. “The [brothers] would go off and speak in Arabic together.” Saadaoui hated mosques, calling them repugnant. He preferred private prayer groups and online Facebook pages where extremists were drawn together by signifiers, such as Saadaoui’s avatar – a picture of the Paris Bataclan terrorist Saadaoui used 10 Facebook accounts to revel in attacks on Jewish people, individual terrorist tactics and disseminate IS propaganda, produced by the group’s media agency, al-Furqan. By 2023 he had moved to Wigan, in Greater Manchester, 20 miles west of one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities, ostensibly to be nearer his brother. To the Saadaoui brothers, even Hamas members were moderate “apostates”. But in 2023, the 7 October attack on Israel became an inspiration. Saadaoui’s antisemitism intensified, along with his desire to stage an attack in the UK. Five days after the atrocity in Israel, he bought an airgun to start practising. On 26 October, he posted an image online of a man preparing to go to war and leaving his children behind. Unknown to him was counter-terrorism police’s immersion in north African jihadist subcultures. This meant Saadaoui, a cautious, secretive individual who had spent years mentally preparing to execute a terror attack, truly believed he had met a fellow IS sympathiser when he began corresponding on Facebook with Farouk in December 2023, the same month he posted on the social media site: “I pray to you Allah not to catch me until I break my thirst with Jewish, Christians and their proxies’ blood.” Saadaoui believed Farouk could get him semi-automatic weapons, sent by divine intervention. He paid a £2,250 cash deposit at their first meeting. It was vital that Farouk let him think he could arm him, as Saadaoui had tried to source guns through Albanian gangsters and police wanted to stop him from getting guns from elsewhere. Farouk had to persuade him he could get AK-47s from Morocco and maintain that ruse until he could be arrested at a handover. Police could have arrested Saadaoui earlier on the basis of his Facebook posts. However, prosecution for those offences would lead to him “being released in a year or two – and then becoming more of a threat”, a senior detective in the case said. But while they believed the undercover investigation was containing the threat from Saadaoui so “the public was never at risk”, the detective admitted the tactic gave him sleepless nights. “There was more than one occasion I thought, what on earth was I doing? What if he goes and does something?” he said. Around the same time he befriended Farouk, Saadaoui recruited Amar Hussein. Describing Hussein’s reaction, Saadaoui said: “I swear to God almighty, this is the first time I saw a man his age crying with tears and hugging me. He said: ‘Bring me a weapon.’” Frank Ferguson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: “Amar Hussein had military training and experience – which Walid Saadaoui didn’t.” Hussein shared Saadaoui’s “jihadist faith”. He lived and worked at Salim Appliances, a white goods repair shop in Bolton. Saadaoui was worried Hussein, an unpredictable, volatile character, would derail their plans by staging a spontaneous attack of his own. He was known for dressing as a follower of IS – including a tool belt that looked like a “suicide belt”. On one occasion, according to Saadaoui, he threatened someone at a restaurant, saying: “I am Daesh [IS] and I came to you with slaughter.” Describing Hussein’s past to Farouk, Saadaoui said: “He is from a Kurdish background, was brought up in Iraq, trained in Saddam’s army … a devotee of the Islamic State. He doesn’t believe in any heretic civilian institution of all kind.” After his arrest, Hussein laid the plot’s motivations bare, telling police: “Your prime minister, you know, he is terrorist that kills our children and gives Israel weapon and kill our children. Terrorism is our religion.” Hussein and Saadaoui travelled repeatedly to Dover in spring 2024 on reconnaissance, observing the port where they believed their weapons – codenamed “goldfinches” by Saadaoui – would be arriving, posing as tourists at the white cliffs. Hussein and Saadaoui had met through Bilel Saadaoui. Jihadist propaganda found on Bilel Saadaoui’s phone included the statement: “To be in a cold icy night in an army of mujahideen waiting to meet the enemy next morning is more beloved to me than a wedding night with the most beautiful bride who I love, or if I were given the good news of having a newborn son.” By May 2024, after all their reconnaissance trips, Hussein and Saadaoui believed they were about to receive guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition from Farouk, after a last trip to Dover. Their preparations were complete. As Saadaoui readied himself to die, he wrote a will and gave it to his brother, having sold the Albatross, placed £74,000 in a safe in his garden and started to teach his wife to drive. Saadaoui had already joined Jewish Facebook groups looking for marches to attack. He had taken Farouk around neighbourhoods north of Manchester city centre, observing synagogues, shops and schools, looking for targets. As they watched ordinary people, peaceably going about their business, Saadaoui said to Farouk: “My blood is boiling, brother, let’s get out of here.” He told Farouk: “We are going to carry out the operation in August … brothers from inside (Islamic State)… they will help.” Instead, on 8 May 2024, police executed a sting operation on the car park of the Last Drop Village hotel in Bolton. Saadaoui was caught red-handed. The guns, unbeknown to him, had been deactivated.",Chris Osuh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 81-year-old had been admitted to hospital after one leg swelled up and turned black. “Going to lose the leg today,” he wrote. The message was not sent to his son, Thomas, who lives with him in Cebu in the Philippines, nor to his older daughter, Samantha, who is based in Florida. Instead, Markle contacted Caroline Graham, the US editor of the Mail on Sunday, who is based in Los Angeles. It was she who called Markle’s two older children to let them know the news. She “He had chosen to break the news of the amputation to me before his own family.” , would learn of her father’s health crisis “through news coverage”, Graham reported coyly several days after the operation, after she had flown to the Philippines to be by his bedside. “However, Mr Markle last night said he has not heard from Meghan ‘but would love to speak to her’.” Few dysfunctional families would find harmony under the close scrutiny of the tabloid press, as British royals have known for half a century and more. For the past eight years, since Meghan’s relationship with Prince Harry became public, that has been the story of the Markles, in which the toxic swirl of the past week is merely the latest unedifying chapter. Meghan, having heard of his ill health last week, had been trying to reach her father, her , but “given that a Daily Mail reporter has remained at her father’s bedside throughout, broadcasting each interaction and breaching clear ethical boundaries, it has been exceedingly difficult for the duchess to contact her father privately, despite her efforts over the past several days”. If Meghan had emailed, her father had not received it, wrote Graham. Eventually, the duchess’s spokesperson said she had written him a letter and “with the support of reliable and trusted contacts, her correspondence is now safely in his hands”. Before Meghan married Prince Harry in 2018, the former actor and her father, a retired lighting director in the TV industry, were reportedly on reasonable, if distant terms. Meghan’s father, then living in Mexico, was in effect a “recluse”, his son in late 2017. “I haven’t seen him in years. He hates the attention Meghan’s romance has brought on to him. He loves her but hates the idea of being in the spotlight.” Thanks to the charms of sections of the press, he appears to have come round to the idea. Thomas, who separated from Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, when the future duchess was two, had initially been due to walk his daughter down the aisle at , but at the last minute she announced he would no longer be attending, amid reports of a heart attack – and after he had posed for staged paparazzi photos. A five-page letter written by Meghan to her father after the wedding was leaked by her father to the Mail on Sunday the following year. “I have to defend myself,” he told Graham. Meghan the newspaper over invasion of privacy. Father and daughter have had little contact since, which has in his views. In 2020, Thomas filmed a documentary in which : “The royals owe me, Harry owes me, Meghan owes me. What I have been through, I should be rewarded for.” Having lost touch with one daughter, he appears to have acquired another, of sorts. Having “met through work”, Graham wrote that she and Thomas had been “rock solid friends” since 2018. “We speak most days and I consider him a father figure.” DMG Media, the parent company of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, has denied Meghan’s accusation that the relationship breaches journalistic ethics. “As well as being a journalist, Caroline has been friends with Mr Markle since 2018. She has been with Mr Markle in hospital every day, providing him with care and support … The suggestion that Caroline has breached ethical boundaries is demonstrably false and vehemently denied,” said a spokesperson. from Prince Harry and others in the new year over allegations of illegal information gathering, which it denies. For now, the family agrees. Meghan’s half-brother, Thomas Jr, said this week that Graham for his father’s health updates: “I trust her, she’s doing a great job, she’s never thrown anybody in the family under the bus … That is where your news is going to come from.”",Esther Addley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donna Ockenden, who has been chairing a review into trust since 2022, is paid an £850 daily rate for every 7.5 hours she works. When asked about her monthly invoices of up to £26,000 for her advice, she said: “I am working long hours.” The monthly charges for “provision of independent advice” in connection with the review do not include the wider costs of the inquiry that are charged to The monthly invoices from Donna Ockenden Ltd can exceed £300,000 a month when costs such as daily expenses, wages of the clinical review and administrative team, transcription, insurance, office space and HR services are added. Much of those additional charges are invoiced at cost but Ockenden said there was a “profit element on the provision of clinical and administration services, but this is needed partly in order to meet various miscellaneous costs that do not come within the charges that are passed across to NHSE under the agreement”. Ockenden was initially on the NHS England payroll and taxed at source but the arrangement was changed in January 2024. Her daily fee also went up by £100 (13%), from £750 to £850, as part of a new supply agreement. For her advice alone, she subsequently invoiced £22,669.50 for March 2024, £20,626.67 for April, £22,329.50 for May, £20,034.60 for June and £26,069.50 for July. Operating through a UK limited company can offer tax advantages through structuring income through a combination of salary and dividends to minimise tax and national insurance (NIC) costs. Ockenden said: “The payment details you have are correct. I am working long hours on the review. I anticipate devoting the vast majority of my time to the review up to the point of publication in June 2026. “The current contractual arrangement provides value to the taxpayer, and involves my running every aspect of the review including coordination of a large team of clinical reviewers.” Of her tax arrangements, she added: “I was retained in a personal capacity by NHSE along with all those individuals working on the review because at its outset, the review was administered by NHSE. When responsibility for managing and delivering the review was contracted to DO Limited those arrangements naturally ceased.” Ockenden’s daily fees exceed the UK’s weekly median wage of £766.60 and highlight the high costs of a series of reviews of maternity and neonatal services in NHS trusts undertaken in recent years. In an interim report published in early December, Baroness Amos, who is conducting an into NHS maternity services in England, noted that despite a significant number of independent investigations and reviews of maternity and neonatal services in NHS trusts since 2015, England was “still struggling to provide safe, reliable maternity and neonatal care everywhere in the country”.

She said she would be willing to chair the inquiry in Leeds as well as a further maternity review at University Sussex NHS trust, describing it as an “honour” to be considered. Soon after, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, told Woman’s Hour on BBC Radio 4 that Ockenden would not be leading the Leeds review owing to her existing commitments. “She won’t be leading the Leeds inquiry, not least because she’s leading the work in , Shrewsbury and Telford,” he said. “If I could clone her, I would, but because Donna has earned the trust of the families she is working with, everyone wants Donna, I understand that and I have huge respect for her. “But I’ve got to make sure to protect the work Donna is already doing but I’ve also got to build a wider team of people who can support the government, support the NHS when trouble arises.” An NHS spokesperson said: “Following the then secretary of state’s appointment of the independent review’s chair in spring 2022, NHS England has worked to ensure the review meets its terms of reference for families, initiating a new contractual agreement in January 2024. “Women and families deserve answers and improved maternity services in Nottingham, and the publication of the review’s final report no later than June 2026 will be a critical step to achieving this.”",Daniel Boffey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speaking to the Guardian after the release of some of the Epstein files, the tranche of documents related to the disgraced financier, Marina Lacerda, an Epstein survivor, said Mountbatten-Windsor should be “brought to justice”. The man previously known as Prince Andrew has been accused of sexually abusing Virginia Giuffre, who he met in 2001 when she was 17 – something he has always denied. Giuffre took her own life in April. appear to show Mountbatten-Windsor asking Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf. Giuffre’s lawyer, Brad Edwards, told the Guardian that anyone who had accepted Mountbatten-Windsor’s denials should “be ashamed of themselves”. “Virginia is an extraordinarily brave hero,” said Edwards, a representative for the late campaigner, whose memoir detailing the alleged abuse was published posthumously in October. “Anyone who ever gave any credence to the denials of Virginia’s claims by Epstein, Maxwell, or Andrew should be ashamed of themselves,” he added. Lacerda, who is originally from Brazil and now lives in the US, met Epstein, then a financier, when she was 14 years old and was exploited by him for three years. Though she has not met the former prince, she is one of many survivors calling for accountability for those accused of involvement in the trafficking of women and girls by Epstein. “I think the first thing that needs to be done here is that the UK needs to bring [Mountbatten-Windsor] to justice,” she said. She said the US government should have done a more thorough investigation into Giuffre’s claims about her alleged abuser, who had his titles and honours removed in October this year over his friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019. “A lot of people didn’t believe her. Everybody ignored it and he was quiet, and at this point it’s like, really? This is what it comes down to – she had to pass away and come out with a book. “It’s not OK. It’s disgusting, I’m sorry. “We have many prominent people who are not being brought to justice or just getting swept under the carpet.” The files also show that the FBI sought to question Mountbatten-Windsor about his links to a second millionaire sex offender, . He refused and no further action was taken. “He does need to come to America [to be questioned], but I don’t think he will, to be honest with you. It is just the right thing to do,” said Lacerda. The latest release of the documents from the US Department of Justice appeared to expose emails between Epstein’s fixer Maxwell and Mountbatten-Windsor in which the former royal asked her to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends”. In the emails from 2001 and 2002, a man named “A” talked about being in Balmoral, the royal residence in the Scottish Highlands, and about the loss of his valet. Reports from 2001 record that Mountbatten-Windsor’s valet, Michael Perry, 61, died days before the email was sent. “A” also wrote about his two girls, though did not name Beatrice and Eugenie, and about leaving the “RN” around the same time Mountbatten-Windsor left the Royal Navy. “Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?” the person, A, asked in one email to Maxwell on 16 August 2001. In later emails, Maxwell wrote to an associate asking for girls who were “friendly and discreet and fun” for a man named Andrew who was making a trip to Peru. She said “some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy”. This coincided with an official trip taken by Mountbatten-Windsor to Peru, to mark the 50th anniversary of his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s reign. Giuffre killed herself in April after years of denials from the former prince ahead of the publication of her memoir Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice. In the memoir, she said she met him in March 2001 when she was 17 and he was 41. She was introduced by Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, taken for dinner with the then-prince and with Epstein, and later to a nightclub. “On the way back, Maxwell told me, ‘When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.’” She wrote: “He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.” Giuffre said she was later given $15,000 by Epstein and was forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor on two more occasions. made in the book: “I vigorously deny the accusations against me.” He reached a settlement with her in 2022.

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/26/unpublished-tupperware-erotica-novel-wet-ink-prompts-fierce-contest-for-tv-rights,Unpublished ‘Tupperware erotica’ novel prompts fierce contest for TV rights,2025-12-26T08:36:32.000Z,"Interest in Wet Ink by Abigail Avis is part of a trend for works by female authors among streamers and production companies A much-hyped novel about a housewife who uses Tupperware parties to secretly smuggle erotic stories to her friends and neighbours is causing a stir in the television world, igniting a fierce bidding contest over the right to adapt it for the small screen. Wet Ink, a novel by the 33-year-old London-based author Abigail Avis, is not scheduled to be published until the spring 2027, but industry insiders said a fierce auction between six major production companies had already taken place for the TV rights. Those interested in the project have called the novel “Tupperware erotica”, and the frenzied interest is part of a recent spate of books by female authors to prompt huge competition for their TV rights as streamers and production companies search for bankable titles that can be sold around the world. The battle follows a similar contest over the publishing rights for the novel, which eventually went to Hodder & Stoughton, owned by Hachette UK, for a six-figure fee. The publisher is already planning a global marketing blitz. Set in 1960s London, the book charts the literary ambitions of Mitzy Barlow, a housewife and mother-of-two stranded in a loveless marriage who has grown weary of the mind-numbing monotony of her life. She begins hosting Tupperware parties – ubiquitous events in the 1950s and 60s – to make some extra income from selling the plastic containers to women in her neighbourhood. However, she soon begins to combine her role as hostess with a burgeoning career as a writer of sexual fantasies, which she starts to compose each night in a journal to help her deal with the bleakness of her marriage. As her confidence grows, Mitzy begins writing her own stories under the pseudonym Queen B. Before long, her part-time job selling Tupperware becomes a cover for smuggling erotic stories to her customers, with the stories stashed safely inside the airtight containers. As her alter ego finds success, Mitzy is left with a dilemma over pursuing a different life, fraught with the danger of being accused of indecency. The novel’s TV rights were eventually secured by Kudos, part of Banijay UK, one of the world’s biggest production companies. It has been behind programmes including the Netflix series The House of Guinness, and the BBC’s This Town and SAS Rogue Heroes. “We are thrilled to have acquired the rights to Abigail’s novel,” said Karen Wilson, the joint managing director of Kudos. “She is a brilliantly talented writer, and Wet Ink is a must read. We cannot wait to get started on developing it into a TV series for both the UK and international market.” Insiders said the demand was a sign of the continuing importance to production companies of hunting down new content, as competition has intensified with the rise of the streamers. There has also been a recent trend of books by female writers to be the subject of ferocious auctions. Industry sources said that in another such contest, 21 offers had already been made. The field for that title has been whittled down to a final 10, described as “a roll-call of glittery producers”. The book in question has not even been finished. Another novel, Death’s a Bitch by the debut author Eloise Rodger, was acquired earlier this year by another Banijay-backed producer, , after international interest led to intense competition for the rights. The novel follows Aggie and the plight of her younger sister Marcie, who has faced a long illness and endless waiting lists. Death offers Aggie a job that will ensure Aggie survives. Avis, who studied and taught English literature before entering a fellowship with The Royal Literary Fund, has said the idea for Wet Ink came to her during one of her children’s midnight feeds. Her agent, Hayley Steed, said that in selling the book rights she had never seen a reaction like it. “Within mere hours we were turning down international pre-empts and it has broken agency records around the globe,” she said. “Abigail has written a book that encapsulates the perfect bookclub read; an empowering call to arms, a warm story of female community and friendship, and just the right amount of naughtiness with its snippets of erotica.”",Michael Savage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Footfall at the country’s high streets and shopping centres fell on Friday morning, running slightly behind last year, according to figures from the monitoring company MRI Software. Across all UK retail destinations footfall slipped by 0.3%. in 2024, there were 2.4% fewer visitors on Britain’s high streets than on 26 December last year, while there was a 2.6% slide in the number of people going to shopping centres. However, retail parks bucked the trend and experienced a 6.9% increase in the number of visitors on Boxing Day morning. Retail parks, which are mostly in out-of-town locations, accessible by car and often offering free parking, have become more popular with shoppers in recent years thanks to their convenience. The rise in shoppers deciding to visit retail parks could be seen as an “encouraging start to Boxing Day”, said Jenni Matthews, the marketing and insights director at MRI. “This suggests that shoppers may well be coming out earlier than expected to grab those bargains; brush off the festive cobwebs,” she added. Colder temperatures may have put off some would-be shoppers from travelling far from home. Central London recorded a 7.7% fall in the number of visitors compared with a year earlier, a much larger decline than the 3.4% fall recorded in other cities. By contrast, there was a near 4% increase in visitor numbers in outer London, and there was a 10% rise in footfall in coastal towns, as consumers hoped to combine a visit to the shops with a day out. The traditional Boxing Day start to the post-Christmas sales has increasingly shifted online in recent years, giving consumers the opportunity to secure some deals from the comfort of the sofa as early as Day itself. Large fashion and homeware retailers including Marks & Spencer and Next are now offering discounts of up to 50% online, while reductions will only be available in stores from Saturday. Despite this, groups of shoppers travelled to , where some outlets opened their doors as early as 7.30am. Queues gathered outside the Selfridges department store before opening, which was offering reductions of up to 50%, as was the cosmetics retailer Lush. In the run-up to the big day, retailers had been , given that Christmas Day fell on a Thursday this year, anticipating that shoppers would hunt out last-minute items at the start of the week. However, there were signs that some consumers held back on purchases. Mild weather during the autumn and the start of winter for much of the country resulted in fewer people adding jumpers, coats or boots to their baskets, according to Clive Black, the head of consumer research at Shore Capital. Many large fashion retailers – including Next and John Lewis – launched their reductions before Christmas, while others including New Look and Sports Direct were advertising discounts of up to 70%. Retailers have faced a tough year of trading in 2025, with many consumers reining in their spending at a time when energy and grocery bills remain high. Uncertainty in the run-up to Rachel Reeve’s budget in late November over possible tax rises at the start of the crucial pre-Christmas trading period. However, the average shopper is expected to spend £17 more on the end-of-year sales compared with last year, according to figures from the lender Barclays, taking the average budget to £253, up from £236 in 2024. However, it predicts that fewer consumers will take part amid cost of living pressures.

There will be a river walk in each region of the country by the end of parliament, the government has pledged. No footpath would be created as part of the “new” river walk, government sources confirmed, but the initiative will enable nature recovery work, accessibility upgrades and community engagement work along the route. a Scottish-style right to roam, where there would be an assumed right for people in England to walk around the countryside. However, the The party replaced this access to nature policy with a pledge to create three national forests and nine river walks. It is difficult to create river walks as the riverbank is owned by many different landowners, with different attitudes to allowing people to walk, boat or swim on their land. This walk, named the Mersey Valley Way, is being created to complement regeneration work in the area. New signs to mark it as a national river walk will be erected and stretches of the existing river path will be upgraded to meet accessibility standards for wheelchairs, mobility scooters, prams, cyclists and horse-riders. The next tranche of national river walks will be identified through competition bids in 2026. Lady Hayman, the access minister, said: “Nature is a huge source of pride and enjoyment for people across the country, but too many people struggle to find ways to access the outdoors. We are changing that today, delivering on our manifesto pledge by launching the first of nine new national river walks, boosting opportunities to be in nature and supporting local businesses that line the routes. “The Mersey Valley Way offers 21km of new paths for people in Manchester and to explore, be outdoors, and enjoy the nature on their doorstep.” The government said it had chosen the area as it had a large concentration of low-income households. Research has found that people on lower incomes, on average, are spending significantly less time in nature. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said there were 30,000 low-income households in Stockport alone, and they hoped this would improve their access to nature.",Helena Horton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/23/ministers-raise-inheritance-tax-threshold-for-farms-after-backlash,Ministers raise inheritance tax threshold for farms after backlash,2025-12-23T17:38:21.000Z,"U-turn lifts limit from £1m to £2.5m after protests and warnings that family farms were at risk Ministers will increase the threshold for taxing inherited farmland from £1m to £2.5m after months of In a statement slipped out just before Christmas, the environment department announced the U-turn, which will apply from April when the tax kicks in. Plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% were The change reversed tax relief that has existed in its modern form since the 1980s. Above the £1m threshold, inherited farmland was to have been taxed at 20%, half the standard inheritance tax rate, in a move initially estimated to raise £520m annually by 2029. The announcement was labelled a “family farm tax” by critics and , with farmers arguing it would prevent many of them from passing on their farms to their children. The reversal follows intensive behind-the-scenes efforts from a group of MPs who had been pushing for the threshold to be changed, and who made their case to Treasury and environment ministers as well as Keir Starmer. The prime minister conceded at a select committee hearing last week that he had been told of terminally ill farmers planning to kill themselves to avoid the tax. Downing Street sources indicated that a number of backbenchers had “built a strong evidence base” and argued privately against the tax, including Starmer’s parliamentary private secretary, Jon Pearce. Nearly a dozen MPs were involved, including the MP for Peterborough, Andrew Pakes; the MP for Aylesbury, Laura Kyrke-Smith; the MP for Buckingham and Bletchley, Callum Anderson; the MP for Hitchin, Alistair Strathern; and the MP for Hastings and Rye, Helena Dollimore. Markus Campbell-Savours, a Labour MP who represents the rural Cumbrian seat of Penrith and Solway, was suspended from the party earlier this month for voting against the tax. A government source said there was no change in Campbell-Savours’ suspension and that he had been disciplined for voting against a budget resolution. In a statement announcing the U-turn, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said ministers had “listened to concerns of the farming community and businesses about the reforms”. Raising the threshold will mean fewer farms will face inheritance tax – a government source said 85% would not pay the levy at all, up from 75%. According to official figures, the number of estates affected next year will be 185, down from 375. Until now, ministers had claimed the £1m threshold would only affect very wealthy farmers who were buying up agricultural land to avoid paying inheritance tax. The climbdown is the latest policy U-turn by Reeves. The government previously abandoned plans to and ditched mooted cuts to disability benefits after a parliamentary backlash. The change means married couples with estates of up to £5m will now pay no inheritance tax on them, as they can combine two £2.5m allowances. It will cost the exchequer £130m, meaning the changes are still expected to raise nearly £300m a year. The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, said: “We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms. “It’s only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain’s rural communities.” The National Farmers’ Union president, Tom Bradshaw, hailed the announcement as a “huge relief to many” that would greatly reduce the tax burden for many family farms. “I am thankful common sense has prevailed and government has listened. I have had two very constructive meetings with prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and dozens of conversations with Defra secretary of state Emma Reynolds. She has played a key role underlining the human impact of this tax. “These conversations have led to today’s changes which were so desperately needed. From the start, the government said it was trying to protect the family farm and the change announced today brings this much closer to reality for many.” The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the change was a big win for the Tories’ campaign against the tax. “Earlier this year, I was told to drop our campaign, that there weren’t many votes in it, there weren’t many farmers, and people assumed they were wealthy enough to cope anyway. I ignored the advice and kept campaigning,” she said. “Farmers are exactly the kind of people Conservatives stand up for.” The Liberal Democrats urged ministers to go further and scrap inheritance tax on farms entirely. Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, said the concession was better than nothing but also called for the tax to be abolished. The Labour Rural Research Group, which represents Labour MPs in rural seats, welcomed the announcement. Jenny Riddell-Carpenter, the MP for Suffolk Coastal and the group’s chair, said it meant “fewer families facing impossible choices, and greater certainty that farms can continue to operate, invest, and contribute to our rural economy”.",Eleni Courea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While “A” – who also refers to themselves as “The Invisible Man” – is not explicitly identified in the emails, they include key details that corroborate the suggestion that they are , who was then still a working royal known as Prince Andrew. The correspondence, dating back to 2001, includes what would seem to be damning language – such as when “A” asks Maxwell “have you found me some new inappropriate friends?” – and sections of text which correlate with details suggesting the messages are from the then prince. Mountbatten-Windsor has been approached for comment. In October, he said of claims about his links with Epstein: “I vigorously deny the accusations against me.” Newspaper reports from the time record that Mountbatten-Windsor did indeed visit Balmoral, the royal family’s Scottish estate, in August 2001. One names him as being at the estate with his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, where they had breakfast with the queen and Prince Philip when there was a “fire scare” as a nurse making Princess Margaret’s breakfast burnt a slice of toast. Beatrice and Eugenie would have been aged 13 and 11 that Summer. The use of “RN” appears to be a reference to the Royal Navy, which the then Duke of York after 22 years in the service. Reports from 2001 record that Mountbatten-Windsor’s valet, Michael Perry, 61, died days before the email was sent. A report in the Daily Mirror said the then prince and his brother Prince Edward were said to be “devastated” at the death of Perry “who has worked for them since they were children.” It added: “Andrew is on holiday at Balmoral. An aide said: ‘He is very, very upset.’” Maxwell responded in an email which appeared to refer to the request days earlier by “A” for “inappropriate friends” telling him: “So sorry to disappoint you. However, the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends This was a response from “A” after Maxwell forwarded messages from someone referred to as Juan Estoban Ganoza, outlining possible activities on a visit to Peru, including visiting the Nazca Lines. Mountbatten-Windsor, then still a working royal and UK trade envoy, did visit Peru in March 2002, with photographs recording him being in locations including Lima. A message apparently forwarded after it had been sent by Maxwell to the individual known as Juan Estoban Ganoza, this email is the only time that the name “Andrew” is directly used. In reply to the forwarded message “A” appears to recognise the sentence as a reference to him, saying: “I will ring him today if I can.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Atkins told Sky News on Wednesday morning: “This being snuck out the day before Christmas Eve means that, of course, we haven’t had chance to scrutinise this properly in parliament. “It seems very odd that they have just snuck this out the day before Christmas Eve. “And what is more, it was a secretary of state [Emma Reynolds, the environment secretary] that announced it, rather than the chancellor.

The chancellor, however, came under concerted pressure to reverse course, with farmers regularly protesting in Westminster and Labour MPs from rural areas warning about the impact on their constituencies. Dozens of Labour MPs were reportedly preparing to rebel against the government and back an amendment to the bill that would have introduced the tax, which is scheduled to be debated in parliament next month. that some farmers were contemplating suicide over the changes – a worry also flagged in for the government by the former head of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) Minette Batters. Reynolds said on Tuesday that the government would raise the threshold at which the tax applies from £1m to £2.5m. Treasury figures show this will reduce the amount of money raised from £430m to £300m. Officials would not say where the extra money would come from, though the £130m that has been foregone is a small fraction of the £22bn of headroom which Reeves has against her own fiscal rules. The NFU president, Tom Bradshaw, said on Tuesday that the announcement was a “huge relief to many”.

Mountbatten-Windsor’s two daughters could be seen walking behind King Charles III and Queen Camilla on their way to church on the private Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Mountbatten-Windsor was not present, nor was his former wife Sarah Ferguson, who last attended the Christmas Day service in Sandringham in 2023. The king and queen led the family along the short distance from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene church for an hour-long service that began at 11am. Eugenie and Beatrice could be seen with their husbands, Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi respectively. Mountbatten-Windsor is believed to be spending Christmas at his Royal Lodge home near Windsor Castle, after the former Duke of York was stripped of his titles by his brother over his friendship to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Queen Elizabeth II’s second son is expected to soon vacate the Royal Lodge for the Marsh Farm property on the Sandringham estate. It is currently being renovated. Also in attendance were the Prince and Princess of Wales, with their children, and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. The Princess Royal and her husband, V Adm Sir Timothy Laurence, were seen walking close behind the king and queen. Anne’s daughter, Zara Tindall, and her husband, the former England rugby international Mike Tindall, were seen a few steps behind King Charles. Hundreds gathered to watch the royals walk to the Christmas morning church service on a bright and sunny morning in East Anglia. The service brings to an end a turbulent year for the royal family. King Charles recently announced the “good news” that he had scaled back his cancer treatment after his diagnosis in 2024. He urged the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to save lives. However, new information about Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to Epstein have continued to emerge, along with details about his rental situation. He was forced to give up his Royal Lodge home amid an outcry about the peppercorn rent he had been paying for the property.",Harry Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr Robert Montgomery, the director of NYU Langone’s Transplant Institute, said the first transplant had already been carried out, with another expected to take place in January. Six patients are initially expected to receive the pig organs, which have been gene-edited in 10 places to reduce rejection by the human body. Should the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) give approval, the trial will be expanded to involve 44 further transplants. The approach, called xenotransplantation, is aimed at solving the shortage of human organs. According to the NHS Blood and Transplant, in the UK alone more than 12,000 people have died or been removed from the transplant waiting list over the past 10 years before receiving a new organ. Participants in the new trial are either ineligible for human kidney transplantation or on a waiting list for such an organ but thought to be more likely to die, or remain un-transplanted, within five years than receive it. “The truth is that there’s just never going to be enough human organs,” Montgomery told the Guardian. He speaks from experience. He is not only a pioneering transplant surgeon and one of , but he has inherited a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy, which killed his father and brother. After Montgomery experienced seven cardiac arrests – one of which resulted in a month-long coma – he “I think everybody really knows that we have a terrible problem in terms of rationing organs because there’s such a scarcity of supply. But unless you’ve walked in the shoes of somebody who’s waiting for a transplant, you don’t really fully understand how unlikely it is that you’re going to receive a transplant in time,” he said. Montgomery has pioneered new approaches to increasing supply of human organs, including . In this situation, a living donor whose kidney is incompatible with their expected recipient is matched with another patient, whose own incompatible donor is then matched to another patient and so on, creating a chain of donors and recipients that increases the availability of compatible organs. Montgomery has also been a leader in the use of organs from donors with hepatitis C, treating recipients with medication to clear the resulting infection, and even accepted a hepatitis C–positive heart for his own heart transplant. But he said other approaches were needed. “Having spent a career trying to increase incrementally the number of human organs available, I realised that we just weren’t making that much progress, not in a meaningful way,” he said. “And any progress we made was kind of deleted by the ever-expanding number of people who are waiting for transplants. ” While the idea of xenotransplantation has been around for decades, Montgomery said recent developments had proved pivotal – including the ability to create gene-edited pigs. “There were all these kind of jokes about xenotransplantation, like it’s just around the corner and it’s an awfully long corner,” he said. “But suddenly we’re in it.” Montgomery carried out the world’s first gene-edited pig-to-human organ transplant in 2021. While the recipient of the kidney was a brain dead individual, Montgomery said it was an important step, showing the organs were not immediately rejected and providing crucial safety data that had opened the door for use in living people. Montgomery said it was even possible that pig organs could eventually become superior to human ones for transplants, with the possibility for further gene edits to make rejection less likely. “They could be superior at some point because we can constantly modify them to make them better, where you can’t do that with a human organ,” he said. have shown that transplanting the pig’s thymus – an organ involved in the development and selection of immune cells – along with the kidney can also improve tolerance, raising the possibility of eventually reducing or even eliminating the need for anti-rejection drugs. “We’re not there yet, but that’s why we’re doing those studies,” he said. While the new clinical trial is a first to be carried out with xenotransplantation, pig organs have previously been transplanted into a handful of humans, most of whom were already severely ill. Some of these patients subsequently had to have the organs removed and , albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. However, Montgomery said there were two living recipients of pig kidneys who still had the organs. He said kidneys and hearts were promising organs for xenotransplantation, while lungs were more complicated. “[And] the liver, it’s still a mystery of whether it’s going to work,” he said. He said he would not be adverse to receiving a pig heart himself. “Next time around, if I continue to be healthy and alive, I certainly would consider it,” he said. “I’ve got kids who have the same genetic disease that I have and I certainly think about them all the time, and want them to have more options than my dad had, or my brother or I had.”",Nicola Davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the staff are said to argue that the idea is “in poor taste due to the current far-right flag campaigns around the country,” a source said. Since the summer, union jacks and other flags of the four nations of the UK have been hoisted from windows, bridges and lamp-posts about the motivation of some of those involved. One group behind the hoisting of flags, named Operation Raise the Colours, accepted a donation from Britain First, a far-right party with an openly anti-Islam, anti-immigration agenda. in October with a “pink theme”, a nod to the colours and light in India, that was attended by 8,000 people, with tickets costing £2,000 a go. Those who attended in October included Naomi Campbell, Alexa Chung, Miuccia Prada, Manolo Blahnik, Sir Steve McQueen, Sir Grayson Perry and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas. Cullinan, who was born in Connecticut to British parents but brought up in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, has said he hoped that the annual celebration will become a “flagship national event”. Described as a “brilliant fundraiser”, Cullinan has nevertheless already faced opposition from inside and outside the institution. The first ball was co-chaired by Isha Ambani, an Indian “businesswoman, philanthropist and arts patron”. She is the daughter of Asia’s richest man, , who owns a petrochemicals conglomerate, Reliance Industries. has criticised the association of the Ambani family, “whose wealth comes in large part from the fossil fuel and petrochemical projects of Reliance Industries”. Prof Nick Groom, author of The Union Jack: The Story of the British Flag, said the should be encouraged to go ahead with its plans despite the concerns raised. He said: “If the British Museum is reconsidering plans for a red, white and blue themed ball next year to celebrate the international concord between the UK and France in exhibiting the in London, then it is not just abdicating its responsibilities as a national institution to safeguard our history, but will effectively be complicit in the politicisation of the union jack – which would open the door to over 400 years of that history being rewritten by the far right. “And in any case, communities will still need symbols of unity – so what will the union jack be replaced by? “We are all accountable here, charged with maintaining and recognising the complexities and indeed contradictions of national symbols. “The only way is to resist simplistic politics that seek to impose one crude meaning on the flag and engage with its diverse history – a history that we can both celebrate and, where appropriate, censure.” Groom added: “George Orwell got it right when he castigated the ‘Bloomsbury highbrow’ for divorcing intelligence from patriotism and treating the expression of national identity as brutish: ‘If you were an intellectual you sniggered at the union jack and regarded physical courage as barbarous.’ “That was in 1941, at the height of the Blitz bombing raids on British and Irish cities that killed over 43,500 civilians (about the population of Salisbury) when Britain faced the very real possibility of a Nazi invasion.” A British Museum spokesperson said: “The inaugural ball was a landmark moment in the museum’s history that secured over £2.5m vital funding for its international partnerships. “We are excited to follow up this year’s success with a ball in autumn 2026 and will announce more details in due course.”",Daniel Boffey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/25/concerns-ageing-society-ignore-opportunities-says-population-expert,"Concerns about ageing society ignore huge opportunities, says population expert",2025-12-25T12:00:40.000Z,"Sarah Harper says society must create new ways of living and working amid potential ‘silver economy’ Concerns over an ageing population are overblown and society should learn to celebrate and capitalise on its “massive cohort of healthy, active, older, creative adults”, a leading population expert has said. While pundits and pressure groups have , highlighting the challenges for the economy and healthcare, others are more upbeat, arguing the rise of the “silver economy” brings Prof Sarah Harper, director of the Oxford Institute of Population , said two-thirds of the world’s countries already had fertility rates below the replacement level needed to maintain the same size population in the next generation, and that the ageing of most populations was inevitable. But she said that brought with it certain positives. Harper said: “This is a success in so much as every baby that is born will have the opportunity – or should have the opportunity – to be highly educated, healthy and live a long, healthy life.” While acknowledging there would be people living into their 80s and 90s who would become frail and need care, Harper said the main opportunity was to capitalise on the increasing health and education of older adults, especially those aged 50 to 70. She said: “There are some challenges [to an ageing population], but there are also huge opportunities and rather than try and resist it, or stop it, or divert it we should be looking for those opportunities, because we have this massive cohort of healthy, active, older, creative adults. “And because we’re still stuck in 20th-century institutions that don’t appreciate them and benefit from them, we need to create new ways of living and working that enable us to take advantage of that massive group of adults.” Experts have stressed the importance of retraining workers, flexible working and a general shift in attitudes towards older workers. Harper said it was also important to tackle inequalities around health and education so that all older adults could make a valuable contribution. the UK population is growing, largely as a result of migration, but also ageing, with 27% of the population expected to be 65 or older by 2072. While the baby boomer cohort is particularly large, that will greatly increase the numbers in the oldest age groups in the coming decades, Harper said younger generations were smaller – and more similar – in size. That means in future the age structure of the population will resemble a skyscraper rather than the traditional pyramid. Harper said: “Providing high quality affordable childcare is the key to unlocking the potential of both younger and older adults.” Yet even Scandinavian countries, which have emphasised gender equality and positive parenting, have failed to raise total fertility rates above replacement level. Harper said: “What we should be doing is saying there are ways that we can support those, particularly women, who want to have children, and that’s around things like good jobs, good housing, good childcare, good gender equality. “But there is always going to be a group, probably growing, of women who have decided that they, for all sorts of reasons, are not going to have children. And in a way, we’ve got to accept that and work with that.” While Harper said concerns over Covid, the climate crisis and overpopulation might be factors in why some have chosen not to have children, she said there were other reasons too, such as not seeing having children as necessarily part of being an adult woman. “I think that is a really big psychological shift,” she said. Harper added the idea that a country needed a high fertility rate was rooted in the outdated view that lots of young people were needed to defend a country. “Actually, we don’t need any more. The world has changed,” she said. “High income countries don’t need babies. We just need to change the structure, the economic structure in particular.” Harper said that people aged 50 to 70 were an “amazing resource” with valuable skills for a knowledge-based economy, with many willing and able to work longer. She said: “People also financially know that if they’re going to retire at 60 and then live for another 40 years … it’s just unsustainable on the kind of pension system we have. One approach to pension reform without disadvantaging people on lower incomes with poorer health and less education would be to link the state pension to national insurance contributions rather than age.” Harper said some had drawn parallels with the rise of women in the workforce. She said: “In the 50s and early 60s, people were saying, ‘Well, what are we going to do if all these women enter the labour market? What are we going to do? It will completely disrupt everything.’ But of course, it happened and now one takes it for granted in many countries [that] of course, women are working equally to men. Well, it’s the same idea for older adults.”",Nicola Davis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inside Paul Doyle’s two-tonne vehicle, the scene was perhaps even more shocking. Dashcam footage played in court this week showed the former Royal Marine screaming angrily as he ploughed into Liverpool FC supporters: “Get out the fucking way! Get out the way! Move, move, move!” His rage grew despite the carnage in his wake. The 134 victims included a six-month-old boy splayed out on the road in his first Liverpool shirt after his pushchair was thrown in the air. Doyle, who sobbed in court, was jailed on Tuesday for 21 years and six months. The judge, Andrew Menary KC, said his actions caused “horror and devastation on a scale not previously experienced by this court”. The Guardian can now reveal that the father of three, described as a mild-mannered “family man”, is said to have had a history of explosive violent outbursts long before the victory parade on 26 May. Someone who served with Doyle in the Royal Marines in the early 1990s described how he was known “really, really quickly to be an absolute live wire”. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a “It was like he was on a tripwire,” the former marine said. “Everyone would say: ‘He’s got a horrendous flash to bang’ – meaning the point you get annoyed to the point you’re punching people is zero time.” Doyle, 54, has a series of previous convictions for serious violence and other offences dating back to the early 90s. He was jailed for a year for biting off a sailor’s ear in a pub brawl in July 1993, six months after being discharged from the Royal Marines after a string of previous offences. He joined the Royal Marines in March 1991, aged 19, after a short period in the Royal Engineers, but quickly got into trouble for violence, dishonesty and criminal damage. By the time he was discharged from the military in January 1993, he had six civilian and service convictions. Fellow service personnel, who were unaware of these convictions, said the young recruit was known in the close-combat Yankee Company for his short fuse. “He was just out drinking with everyone and he’d just be filling people in,” said one former marine. “He had zero escalation – he was just on the tripwire.” He said Doyle became an “outcast” in his troop before he left the Marines in 1993: “Normal people would give him a wide berth. They’re 21 years old and they’re trying to pull girls. They don’t want to be around some sort of lunatic Tasmanian devil who’s trying to knock everyone out who bumps into him.” It is understood that Doyle was discharged by the marines after four years following the convictions, when he was told his “service was no longer required”. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment. In the 30 years since he was released from prison in May 1995, Doyle had “taken steps to lead a positive and productive life”, the prosecutor, Paul Greaney KC, said on Friday. He is understood to have worked previously for an NHS trust and a large UK wealth management firm before running two now-dissolved companies – one of which involved headwear inspired by the actor Vin Diesel. Doyle, an Everton fan, lived with his wife and three sons in a smart detached home in Croxteth, 6 miles from Liverpool city centre. Such was the ferocity of Doyle’s actions, many in the crowd thought they were in the middle of a terrorist attack. That was quickly ruled out by DCI John Fitzgerald and his team of 70 officers. The truth was more unfathomable. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a “To think that it’s just somebody in a fit of rage driving over those people is incomprehensible really,” said Fitzgerald. He described the dashcam footage, which prompted gasps and tears in court, as “the most graphic and distressing” video he had seen in 20 years of policing. “Doyle’s total disregard for the safety of others – particularly the many young children present on Dale Street and Water Street that day – is beyond comprehension. It is sheer luck that no lives were lost,” he added. Six miles away, in a command and control centre in Bootle, the emergency services watched the horror unfold on live CCTV cameras. Simon Galley, the event commander for St John Ambulance, recalled the “shock” of seeing a trail of bodies as frantic calls came over the radio: “I couldn’t believe that something like this is happening here and now.” Galley, who was in charge of more of 150 highly trained St John’s volunteers, said it was a “miracle” no one was killed. It was by far the biggest mass-casualty incident of his 36 years at the charity. Over two days at Liverpool crown court, 78 of Doyle’s victims spoke of their life-changing physical and psychological injuries. The mother of a boy who cannot be identified said he woke up crying from the nightmares, was anxious about the scar on his face and a bald patch on his head. “Before the collisions he was full of energy, curiosity and joy – a child with endless opportunities before him,” she said. “So much of that has been taken away from him.” Many said they were “haunted” by the “spine-chilling” sight and sounds of panic, fear of crowded places and of returning to Liverpool city centre. Families described thinking their loved ones had been killed as they disappeared from view. The mother of a seven-month-old boy said she could not forget the “terrifying image of my pram being struck and being taken by the car”. “The horror of not knowing if he was alive or dead in that moment will live with me forever,” she said, adding that the Liverpool accent – now associated with panic – triggered heart palpitations and dizziness. Susan Farrell, 55, said she thought about that day all the time. Her daughter, an avid Liverpool fan, had been unable to watch her beloved club because “the sight of red shirts and chants are unbearable reminders of that day”. Addressing Doyle, who sat in the dock with his head bowed, she said: “There are hundreds of people affected by that day … think of them. Don’t sit in the dock and cry for yourself.”",Josh Halliday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/asian-women-england-severe-birth-injuries,Asian women in England almost twice as likely to suffer severe childbirth tears,2025-12-26T08:00:05.000Z,"Exclusive: Analysis of NHS data shows rates of most serious tears are nearly double those for white and black women are almost twice as likely to suffer the most severe birth injuries during labour, with many healthcare professionals unaware of this greater risk, analysis has found. Third- and fourth-degree tears, also known as obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI), are the most severe forms of vaginal tearing during childbirth. Up to 90% of women experience some tearing during labour, with most of these injuries healing quickly and having a relatively minor impact. A third-degree tear extends into the muscle that controls the anus and a fourth-degree tear extends further into the lining of the anus. figures obtained via a freedom of information request, Asian women suffered third- and fourth-degree tears at a rate of 2,831 tears per 100,000 deliveries during 2023-24. This compares with rates of 1,473 per 100,000 for white women and 1,496 per 100,000 for black women. Such injuries can result in life-changing physical and mental harm, including bowel incontinence, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain. Geeta Nayar, a senior associate at Irwin Mitchell and advocate for the MASIC Foundation, which supports women who have suffered severe injuries during childbirth, and the Birth Trauma Association, said the reasons Asian women were at a greater risk of severe tearing during childbirth were “multifactorial – from anatomical and physiological differences to structural systemic issues”. Lia Brigante, a professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, said that although women of Asian ethnicity had been shown in several western-based studies to face a higher risk of perineal trauma, “this knowledge isn’t consistently reaching frontline staff, as many women tell us their midwife or doctor seemed unaware they were at higher risk”. Brigante said: “The reasons for this disparity are complex and remain unexplained. Difference in care, rates of instrumental births, nutrition and inequalities in how women’s needs are recognised during labour may all contribute. However, there is not enough evidence to fully understand why this gap exists.” She added: “Every woman deserves personalised care and honest conversations about possible risks and options available. Asian women must be supported with evidence-based practices and feel heard and respected throughout labour and birth.” Nayar, who is south Asian and experienced a third-degree tear when giving birth to her daughter that left her with permanent injuries, added that the focus needed to be on what could be positively changed to improve outcomes. She said: “Adequate information about individual risks, including the increased risk of OASI, needs to be given to women antenatally in a culturally and linguistically acceptable manner.” The analysis comes as previous research found the had risen from 25 in 1,000 in June 2020 to 29 in 1,000 in June this year – a 16% increase. Chloe Oliver, the chief executive of MASIC, said: “At MASIC we see the impact of OASI birth injuries every day, and the lifelong emotional and physical consequences they carry.” She added: “One of the major risk factors for sustaining an OASI is being of south Asian heritage, but like several other risk factors – such as a forceps delivery, carrying a large baby, older maternal age or short maternal height – so few women are aware of their risk because it’s not routinely discussed in antenatal appointments. “Urgent improvements in antenatal counselling are needed to inform women of their risks and to allow them to make an informed choice with their healthcare professional on the best and safest delivery for both mum and baby.” An NHS spokesperson said: “Every woman deserves safe, high-quality, compassionate and equitable maternity care. We remain firmly committed to tackling the disparities that affect Asian women and other communities, ensuring that every mother receives the highest standard of support throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period.”",Tobi Thomas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/21/norfolk-coast-oysters-project,Sea change: the drive to restore millions of oysters on the Norfolk coast,2025-12-21T13:00:02.000Z,"The first ever mass deployment of mother reef bricks aims to rebuild habitats – and could reshape the North Sea Allie Wharf’s career unfolded amid conflict. As a senior foreign producer for Newsnight, she reported on Iraq and Afghanistan. Just two years ago, she was filming mass graves in Ukraine. But burnt out by wars, and after a detour farming ducks in Tanzania, Wharf has now settled on the quiet north coast. Here, alongside her life and business partner, Willie Athill, she has embarked on a different kind of mission: the creation of Europe’s largest natural oyster reef. The Luna Oyster Project, a collaboration between Norfolk Seaweed and Oyster Heaven, aims to restore 4 million oysters to the North Sea, using the first-ever mass deployment of mother reef bricks. These fired clay structures provide the skeleton of a lost world. Centuries of bottom trawling and human impact have stripped historical oyster reefs bare, leaving only scattered fragments of what was once a teeming underwater landscape across Britain and Europe. These reefs, long absent, are now poised to anchor a new era of marine life along the coast. Luna’s new mother reefs have recently been installed 2 miles out to sea. In April, millions of baby oysters from Morecambe Bay will be rehoused in their nooks and crannies, slowly forming their own natural reefs that could one day connect with smaller restoration projects to the north and south, forming a living lattice of biodiversity along England’s North Sea coastline. “It’s been very expensive and time-consuming,” Wharf admitted. “Our licence application was 280 pages and cost six figures.” Securing the licence took more than three years. George Birch from Oyster Heaven said: “None of the licences care that you’re restoring biodiversity. We had to jump through the same hoops as oil and gas platforms.” Beyond the paperwork, the job itself demands delicate attention. “You have to tend to oysters like babies,” Wharf said. “It’s like a sweet nursery. We’re even considering whether to play the music of the sea to them; it has to be recorded locally because they’re very sensitive to different sea sounds.” Birch called the reefs “living soil”, sparks of life on an otherwise barren seabed. Oysters are astonishingly fecund. Across multiple spawning seasons, over a lifespan of 10 years or more, a single female can release tens of millions of eggs, even though the vast majority perish before they ever find a surface to cling to. The oysters are not for eating, but the restoration is more than a purely ecological exercise. It is also a community endeavour. The project has employed local ecologists, project managers and crew, reviving skills and livelihoods that once thrived around oyster and mussel farming. Birch said: “Historically, the North Sea was crystal-clear, unrecognisable compared to today’s muted waters, because trillions of oysters were filtering the waves, each little creature cleansing 200 litres of water every day.” Native oyster reefs also act as natural wave breaks, stabilising coastlines, fostering biodiversity and transforming flat seabeds into complex, three-dimensional ecosystems teeming with life. “A reef will create an entire ecosystem out of a barren seabed,” said Birch. “We did a trial run on a virtually bare seabed in the Netherlands and after one year, there were 12.7 million brand-new crabs, worms, fish, microbes and fungi on the reefs.” That is why the project is largely funded by Purina, the pet food company. “What they are buying from us is supply-chain resilience,” said Birch. “Purina source fish from the North Sea for their products and need to know that resource is going to be sustainable and high-quality. By improving the marine environment, that’s what our oysters are doing for them.” Oysters themselves are exquisitely sensitive, responding to light, pressure and sound. Not only can they change sex but Birch described realising that his hatchery female oysters were only spawning eggs on Mondays. “We were, like, ‘How do they know it’s Monday?’” he said. “Then we realised that Mondays come after the two quiet weekend days, showing they were aware of the peacefulness in the room around them at the weekend and so felt safe enough to mature their eggs. How awesome is that?” From the chaos of war zones to the meticulous care of microscopic life, Wharf, Athill and Birch are cultivating tiny, perceptive lives that will quietly transform the seabed into vibrant ecosystems – hopefully reshaping the North Sea. “One of the most beautiful things that I’ve discovered about oysters is how sensitive they are,” said Birch. “They can sense pressure changes in the air outside the water: if you open a door into the hatchery room, they’ll all shut their shells. They know you’ve come in.”",Amelia Hill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/25/reconnecting-defence-society-public-outreach-uk-aim-cadet-recruitment-drive,‘Reconnecting’ defence with society: the public outreach aims behind UK’s army cadet drive,2025-06-25T06:00:35.000Z,"Government’s defence plans include 30% expansion of cadet forces, seen as critical to ‘understanding’ of defence It is a balmy Thursday evening in north-east London and a dozen teenagers in combat fatigues are practising first aid on each other inside an army cadet training centre. “Remember, never leave a casualty alone as they might freeze to death,” an instructor reminds them as a newer group of recruits in the yard outside get to grips with marching under the watchful eye of L/Cpl Erik Hanuschi, a cadet veteran at 17. “I joined because my mum wanted [me] to, because of the discipline and stuff, to instil it. I didn’t know if I was going to like it but, eventually, after two parade nights, I was like: ‘OK, this is pretty good,’” he says, giving voice to one of the attractions of the army-sponsored youth movement to successive governments, schools and some parents. Yet the cadets are now the frontline of something new – albeit harking back to their historical roots in times of looming French or German invasions – after what the recent strategic defence review described as Keir Starmer’s launch of a “national conversation” on defence and security. While the review’s recommendations for billions to be spent on weaponry captured the headlines, lesser noticed plans that could have an even bigger impact on everyday life in Britain involve “reconnecting” defence with society. The next two years will see “public outreach events” across the UK “explaining” current and future threats and the rationale for more defence spending. Part of this will involve the armed forces becoming “more visible” in society and the sight of people in uniform less rare in daily life. A potentially controversial plank involves the Ministry of Defence (MoD) working with the Department for Education “to develop understanding of the armed forces among young people in schools”. One vehicle for this could be the current curriculum review. However, another revolves around a 30% expansion of school- and community-based cadet forces by 2030, with a greater ambition to reach 250,000 in the longer term. Alistair Carns, the minister for veterans and people, told the Guardian the MoD will be “mapping” out areas across the UK where the cadets can be expanded, with a view to increasing numbers from 140,000 to 180,000. Carns views the cadets as a “critical component” to increasing public understanding of defence and breathing new life into connections that have waned. He added: “You’re more likely to know a veteran now than you are to know someone serving, and so society’s connection to defence and the understanding of the utility of defence, and why [it] is really important – protecting the freedoms that we all enjoy – isn’t necessarily understood.” The plans have earned a qualified welcome from the Association of School and College Leaders, which told the Guardian that cadet forces “work very well” in many schools and that the expansion was “understandable in the light of the security threats faced by the UK, and could help to foster wider understanding of the part played by the armed forces in keeping us safe”. However, its general secretary, Pepe Di’Iasio, added: “The big challenge is going to be the funding, staffing and facilities necessary for expanding cadet forces in this way. Schools and colleges are under huge financial pressure and many are left with no option other than to reduce extracurricular activities.” Rather than recruits, one of the biggest challenges to the plans is expected to be finding adult volunteers. Carns is examining how more adults – including former soldiers – could be incentivised to become involved. He and those running the cadets are also eager to talk up how the movement has changed, with a greater focus on Stem skills and exploring modern technology. Prof Simon Denny, who has led independent and MoD-commissioned research into the cadets, said: “We’re going to see changes reflecting the reality of modern warfare as seen in Ukraine, more kit and things like simulators, which the air cadets are already using. “Everyone also now uses drones. There are cadet detachments with budgets who will have gone out and bought one. It’s obvious then that AI will be part of it – think of how the sea and air cadets could use it.” Back at the cadet training session, Maj Tony Adams recalled using a variant of the Lee Enfield bolt action rifle – first used in the second Boer war – when he joined the cadets in 1984. Adams, who later served in the regular army and now volunteers as a cadet leader, emphasised that the cadets are not a recruiting vehicle for the army, but was candid about the pull factor of guns when it came to why many youngsters join. “It’s what makes us different. It’s who we are,” he said. L/Cpl Mia Bondzie, 15, spoke of having grandparents who had served and said she would consider the army in the long run. “I’m a very maths-oriented person, so maybe I would want to look at something like communications or the intelligence side, rather than actually focusing on the infantry or down on the ground,” she added. Among the dozen or so cadets taking part in the first aid session – most of whom were young women – there was a striking show of hands in response to some questions. At least three had put their medical skills to use in the real world, at school and in the home, while a majority said they would consider joining the army.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/22/what-happened-next-led-by-donkeys-trump-epstein-windsor-castle,What happened next: the night Led By Donkeys projected Trump and Epstein on to Windsor Castle,2025-12-22T05:00:17.000Z,"The art activists made headlines during the US president’s state visit when they shocked the waiting media with a short documentary – and were quickly arrested hen Donald Trump’s second state visit was announced, and when the finer details for the Windsor banquet on 17 September 2025 became known, there was no way was going to let that pass unprotested. It was just so craven, rolling out the red carpet for Trump. Their next art-activist event unfolded like clockwork. Led By Donkeys made a nine-minute film about Trump’s relationship with which ended: “The president of the United States was a long-time close friend of America’s most notorious child sex trafficker. He’s alleged to be mentioned, numerous times, in the files arising from the investigation into that child sex trafficker … Now that president, Donald Trump, is sleeping here, in Windsor Castle.” (Trump says that he fell out with Epstein years before Epstein was first arrested, and has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.) The group had booked rooms in the Harte and Garter hotel, which handily tags them “castle view” and “even more helpfully”, says Ben Stewart, a founder, “castle view superior”. They had a massive 32,000-lumen projector and, for the soundtrack, Stewart went outside and put a Bluetooth speaker, hidden in a box of Kellogg’s Fruit ’n Fibre, on top of a rubbish bin. The world’s media were amassed, staring at the castle, but they were bored because Trump hadn’t yet arrived. . “Although the still pictures of Epstein and Trump went crazy online,” Stewart says, “I’m not sure that persuades anyone of anything – it just makes Trump uncomfortable. The film we made gives people a social object to share, saying: ‘There’s something really serious to look at here.’ We took a piece of guerrilla journalism about Trump and Epstein, and it was viewed 20m times.” The film started with the Windsor Castle logo. “It requires a little bit of mapping to project on to a cylindrical building,” Stewart says. “So there’s this royal crest of arms. The police are thinking: ‘Ah, that’s nice – the royal family,’ and suddenly a great big picture of Jeffrey Epstein comes up. This electric jolt goes through the fluoro [fluorescent jackets of the police] around me, and the police all pile into the hotel.” It wasn’t the group’s first rodeo, of course; it wasn’t even their first action against Trump. Back in 2018, while working for Greenpeace, Stewart over the hotel where the president was staying when he visited Turnberry, in South Ayrshire; the next year, Stewart got a visit from the police, who told him that if he tried that again, they couldn’t be responsible for what would happen. But none of the Led By Donkeys creators were especially worried about getting arrested. “All my anxiety is channelled into wanting the action to succeed,” says Oliver Knowles, another co-founder of the group. “By the time the police make the intervention, the die is cast.” Well, sort of – the police moved fast and were in the lobby within three minutes, “really pumped up”, Knowles remembers. “They were in jumpsuits and baseball caps. They’d finally found some protesters. They came roaring up the stairs; they were briefed; they were on a mission to protect the president. Thankfully, no guns. But they were very adrenalised when they came into the room. I had to say to them: ‘Let’s keep this really calm.’” Six minutes is a long time to stall a large number of police officers. They didn’t know what law they were planning to make any arrests under, so that helped. When the police finally got into the room, “one officer started reading a section of the Town and Country Planning Act, which another officer asked him to stop reading because it wasn’t right.” Knowles and three other team members were then arrested for malicious communication, which is a stalking law, “and it’s very specific: it’s designed to deal with a really concerning offence. To throw it at a piece of journalism, projected on to a wall, to protect the reputation of the president, seemed against the spirit of the legislation,” Stewart says archly. While the others were getting arrested, he was melting into the crowd, then soon after was on the train out of Windsor, calling lawyers. Some time in the middle of the night, when the activists were in the cells of Maidenhead police station, officers came in and arrested them again, this time for public nuisance, having decided that was more likely to succeed in court. When they came to be questioned, the only officers available were from the child protection squad – and the irony of child protection officers questioning Led By Donkeys over the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein because all the regular police were busy protecting … well, it was striking. Knowles and his associates just answered every question: “No comment.” A few minutes into the interview, the officers slid over a photograph: “‘Mr Knowles, did you remove the drawer from this bedside table?’ ‘No comment.’ ‘Mr Knowles, do you know anybody else who may have had reason to remove the drawer?’ ‘No comment.’ I knew what was coming: a picture of a giant projector, ratchet-strapped to four drawers. At that point the detectives were finding it hard to keep a straight face.” Just over a month later, all charges were dropped.",Zoe Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-animal-welfare-a-timely-reminder-that-cruelty-is-wrong,The Guardian view on animal welfare: a timely reminder that cruelty is wrong,2025-12-23T18:25:48.000Z,"New protections for hares, and more humane conditions on farms, should be welcomed by all ooking after wildlife and improving the lives of farm animals and pets are the related but distinct aims of the government’s new animal welfare strategy for England. Its launch is timely: more than 1 billion chickens and are reared each year – with many of the latter slaughtered in the run-up to Christmas. Winter is also peak season for pet abandonments, with animal charities particularly fearful this year, given the of dogs and cats being dumped. Pledges to end the use of cages for laying hens, and cramped farrowing crates for pigs, will be welcomed by all who object to animal cruelty. So will a proposal to replace the of pigs with an alternative that is less distressing for them. New rules for farmed fish are also on the way. Until now, fish have been largely excluded from the evolving set of regulations aimed at minimising suffering at the point of slaughter. Most European countries already protect breeding hares from hunters by making it illegal to kill these beautiful animals during the months when they rear their young. The announcement of a is overdue. As the Conservative former environment secretary George Eustice told the Guardian, “even the Victorians recognised the need for a close season” when shooting hares is banned. Pledges to ban snare traps and trail hunting – where hounds chase a scent rather than a fox – were in Labour’s manifesto. Trail hunting is already banned in Scotland, and its continuation in England was a compromise when foxhunting was outlawed. Ministers will need to tread carefully if they want to avoid another on inheritance tax, which will now apply to farms worth £2.5m rather than £1m. Rightly, the strategy acknowledges the potential for adverse impacts on farmers from higher welfare standards. It pledges that trade policy will be used to protect them if lower-welfare imports gain an “unfair advantage”. When it comes to pets, it is the interests of owners that need to be balanced with animal welfare. With an estimated 10.6 million dogs across the UK, the includes a provision that ought to make it easier for private tenants in England to keep pets. But the pet boom has brought problems too. A new registration scheme for dog breeders aimed at stamping out maltreatment, and a review of international rescue schemes, are sensible steps. But enforcement will be needed to back any changes up. Unless councils and other bodies are equipped for inspections and investigations, animals will continue to suffer. As ministers know, animal welfare is popular with the public. Trickier issues such as the are ducked in a strategy that focuses on the recognition of animals as sentient beings. There is a great deal here that is subject to consultation and may take years to come into force. The other UK nations are already ahead in some regards. Electric shock collars for cats and dogs, for example, were banned in Wales in 2010. But ministers are right to highlight the issues. Animals should be treated with compassion, not cruelty. In a world that is changing rapidly for them as well as for humans, the law needs to keep up.",Editorial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/labour-british-economy-2026-worse,Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time to turn Britain around,2025-12-24T06:00:03.000Z,"Going into 2026, the economy has little forward momentum. And there’s the issue that things may get worse before they get better ll governments go through bad patches, when nothing seems to go right and voters turn against them. Often they bounce back from the midterm blues and go on to be comfortably re-elected. That said, Labour’s current unpopularity is in a class of its own. It is not just the scale of its problem, with opinion polls suggesting support for the party , from 34% to 18% since the 2024 general election. Nor is it simply the speed at which disillusionment with the government has set in, though that too is unprecedented. What’s really remarkable is that the public is not normally this negative about a government unless the economy is in the deepest of slumps. If the UK had double-digit unemployment and house prices were crashing, Labour’s political predicament would be a lot easier to explain. Clearly, 2025 has been a far from vintage year for the economy, but it hasn’t been that bad either. Britain has trundled on in much the same way it has since the global financial crisis of 2008. Economic performance has been mediocre but not disastrous. True, growth has slowed since a strong start to 2025 and unemployment has edged up. At 5.1%, is a full percentage point higher than when Labour came to power in July 2024, but still a long way short of the levels seen in the deep recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. What’s more, for those in work, living standards have been rising, because wage growth has outpaced inflation. Governments normally benefit when voters are better off, but this one hasn’t. Past Labour governments have been through much worse years without suffering such a marked drop in public support. In 1947, Clement Attlee’s administration was buffeted by a series of adverse shocks, with fuel shortages during a brutally cold winter followed by a sterling crisis in the summer. Rationing imposed during the second world war was still in force. In 1975, inflation hit a postwar peak of 25%, eventually leading to a run on the pound and spending cuts imposed on Jim Callaghan’s government by the International Monetary Fund in late 1976 as the price of securing a loan. It took many years for Labour to recover from that humiliation. More recently, in 2008, the near-collapse of the banks during the global financial crisis led to the economy shrinking for more than a year. From peak to trough, by more than 6%. In the past year it Labour is confident that its political fortunes will improve, as voters start to feel the benefits of rising incomes and lower interest rates. That certainly happened in the past, although the impact has not always been enough to save the party from defeat at the subsequent election. Attlee narrowly won in 1950 and secured Labour’s highest-ever vote share, despite losing the 1951 election. The economy grew strongly in the two years after the IMF loan, and by 1978, Callaghan of holding an autumn election. He eventually lost in May 1979, as did Brown Starmer is the most unpopular prime minister . His approval ratings are worse than those of Callaghan – who, even after the strikes in the 1978-79 winter of discontent, choice for prime minister than Margaret Thatcher – and of Gordon Brown, who ran out of time in 2010 but still did well enough to deprive David Cameron of an overall majority. It is far from clear why the present Labour government has lost public support more extensively and more rapidly than those of the 1940s, 1970s and 2000s, even though economic conditions have been more benign. Almost certainly it is a combination of factors: life is , especially for the young; the public’s patience has worn thin after a decade-and-a-half of flatlining living standards; Labour’s lack of a real plan has been exposed; issues other than the economy – – may now influence voters more than they once did. One thing seems obvious. There is no guarantee that voters will reassess their view of Labour even if – and this seems unlikely – the economy really starts to motor in 2026. On the contrary, things are likely to get worse before they get better, partly as the result of policy errors by the Bank of England and the Treasury. The Bank has been too slow in cutting interest rates, and from 4% to 3.75% was a classic case of too little, too late. Rachel Reeves, for her part, to hire workers by raising employers’ national insurance contributions in her 2024 budget. All governments make mistakes, and they need not be fatal. But Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time on its hands to turn things around, even though the next election could be as far away as the summer of 2029 and much can happen in that time. Yet, the economy ends 2025 with precious little forward momentum. Business confidence , and high street spending by consumers . The rate cut from the Bank of England was a response to an economy that is not simply sluggish, but in real distress. So here’s the rub: the government is already phenomenally unpopular. There would be no coming back from a recession – even a relatively short-lived and shallow one.

The warning came from the pressure group Countryside Alliance, which said tens of thousands of supporters had joined gatherings in the morning, as it released a poll suggesting 65% of people think the Provisions for a ban on trail hunting are included in the government’s animal welfare strategy, which was . The practice, which involves hounds following a scent rather than a live animal, was introduced to comply with a ban on pursuing foxes introduced in the Hunting Act 2004. The ban is likely to cause further friction between the government and rural communities after the recent row over , which led to a partial U-turn by the government on Tuesday. A consultation on how to implement the ban will be launched in early 2026. Critics of trail hunting say it has been used as a smokescreen to enable illegal foxhunting. Hunt saboteurs who monitored hunts over the Christmas period provided what they claim is evidence of illegal activity. Tim Bonner, the Countryside Alliance’s chief executive, said: “When Keir Starmer said he wanted a new relationship with the countryside, we all assumed he meant a better one, but in 18 months his government has alienated rural people and created the clear impression that it does not care about the countryside. Its warped priorities have put taxing family farms, raising rates for rural businesses and banning trail hunting above policies that would benefit rural people. “While the partial changes to the family farm tax are a step in the right direction, the government must desperately learn the fundamental lesson of this policy debacle, which is that it needs to work with the rural community – not legislate against it.” A poll by the analysis firm ORB International suggested only 36% of people in Britain agreed or strongly agreed that the government cared about people who live in the countryside, while 76% said they believed the government prioritised urban issues over rural ones. ORB surveyed 2,083 British adults online between 12 and 14 December. Johnny Heald, the chief executive of ORB’s UK operation, is a director of the Countryside Alliance’s corporate vehicle, Working for the Countryside. A spokesperson for the pressure group said it operated separately to ORB. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “This government is committed to banning trail hunting, which is too often used as a cover for illegal foxhunting, and has strong public support across the country.” Referring to its response to a review of the agricultural sector carried out by the former National Farmers’ Union president Minette Batters, it added: “This builds on previous animal welfare reforms delivered by this government, including giving police greater powers to prevent dog attacks on livestock, protecting farmers and animals alike. “The Batters review highlighted the need for greater collaboration between industry, farmers and government – and that is exactly what we will do. We have increased the individual inheritance tax threshold from £1m to £2.5m, meaning couples with estates of up to £5m will pay no inheritance tax.” Those seeking to exploit the planned trail hunting ban as a “culture war” issue include the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who attended a hunt in Kent. He told GB News that the government was made up of people with “an ignorance” of rural communities. Emma Slawinski, the chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: “Banning trail hunting isn’t an attack on the countryside, it’s an attack on those who would use weaknesses in the law to get around it, and who have done for the last two decades.” Commenting on the ORB poll, she said: “The same polling shows banning trail hunting narrowly missed being in last place on the list of issues the respondents say would influence their vote at the next election, which suggests the narrative from the Countryside Alliance is completely out of touch with rural values.”",Ben Quinn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/27/paul-nowak-tuc-labour-forge-closer-relationship-europe,Trade unions leader calls on Labour to forge closer relationship with Europe,2025-12-27T05:00:28.000Z,"In an exclusive interview, the head of the TUC Paul Nowak says a customs union with the EU could boost the UK’s economy Keir Starmer should seek out a far closer relationship with Europe, including a possible customs union, the head of the TUC has said. Paul Nowak, TUC general secretary, said the British public recognised the need for a vastly improved trading arrangement and said it had become more urgent than ever because of the fickle nature of the relationship with Donald Trump’s United States. In an interview with the Guardian, Nowak said Starmer must relentlessly focus on the cost of living to improve Labour’s standing in the polls, saying it was little surprise there was leadership chatter when the party was doing so badly. But he warned would-be challengers they would “not be thanked” by the public for distracting the government from its core focus on the economy. He also cautioned Starmer and the home secretary Shabana Mahmood not to be “Nigel Farage-lite” when it came to the migration crackdown, saying trade unions were worried about reforms to indefinite leave to remain. Nowak’s new year’s message urged the government to do all it could to help ordinary families, with new polling showing four in five households say their financial circumstances are either stagnant or getting worse. The union chief said a customs union with the EU should be explored as a way of growing the economy. “The government needs to do whatever it can to build the closest possible positive working relationship with Europe economically and politically as well … up to and including the customs union,” he said. “I think that’s been reinforced by the events of the past 12 months where Trump and the White House have proven the US is not the predictable ally we’ve always depended on.” Nowak, 53, said he did not believe there was a significant number of voters who still remained opposed to closer trading ties with Europe – but said it should go beyond electoral considerations. “Whether you voted for Brexit or not, people recognise we’ve got a botched Brexit deal,” he said. “They can see the impact of that bad Brexit deal on things like prices in supermarkets.” Nowak, who took over the leadership of the in 2022, has been a strong supporter of Starmer in the past, despite condemning the government’s winter fuel cuts and welfare reforms, mostly now reversed. But he gave only cautious backing to the prime minister, with Starmer’s position likely to come under further pressure after next year’s crunch May elections. “He is the man doing the job at the moment,” Nowak said. “When I go around and talk to groups of union reps in workplaces … they are not obsessed about who is the prime minister or who is up or who is down.” Unions have recently elected leaders who are sceptical of the current Labour administration, despite low turnouts. Two of the biggest unions are now led by Starmer critics, Sharon Graham at Unite and the newly elected Andrea Egan at Unison, who was expelled from the Labour party in 2022. Nowak declines to pass comment on what that might mean for relations with trade unions. But, he said, unions should feel able to call out a Labour government. “There’s always going to be points of tension and we can’t agree on everything,” he said. “I think people got frustrated that sometimes it looked like the hard choices were falling on those who could least afford them. This year they just have to be clear … show how you are making a difference to people’s standard of living.” He said he was pleased to see Labour U-turn before the budget on plans for an income tax rise. “It’s not just the sharp end of the labour market who are feeling the pinch, it’s right across those low- and middle-income earners.” Nowak said he was unsurprised that there was speculation about Starmer’s leadership. One of his likely challengers would be Angela Rayner, who has close union ties, especially with Unison, and who steered the employment rights bill before she was forced to resign earlier this year. “When the prime minister personally is doing badly in polls, you’re never going to be able to avoid that [leadership speculation],” Nowak said. “I just don’t think it’s useful for me to do fantasy politics. We’re dealing with the realities of what we’ve got right now.” He said Starmer had an opportunity this year to deliver tangible differences to how people felt about the cost of living, saying if he did so it would “look fundamentally different in the polls”. But he warned leadership hopefuls not to get distracted by politics. “Frankly, the public will not thank you for parliamentary manoeuvrings and political shenanigans when the big job at hand isn’t being delivered.” Nowak said that he remained extremely concerned about the rise of Reform UK – despite acknowledging many trade union members were likely to be supporters of Nigel Farage’s party. But he said the normalisation of racist language was having a devastating impact on some minorities. “I was in County Durham a couple of months ago, and met a black woman social worker who’d been in the country for 20 years. She talked about her experience of being afraid to walk out on the streets because she is being racially abused,” he said. “What we’ve done is legitimise language that frankly five, 10 years ago we would think was unacceptable. If it walks like a racist and quacks like a racist, it probably is racist.” Nowak said he acknowledged there was widespread concern about high levels of immigration – and said unions would be prepared to back fair-minded reforms. But he cautioned they would have a major effect on public services – and that he was deeply concerned about the proposed change to make people wait 10 years for indefinite leave to remain. “It has real-world consequences for people working in care homes, on our railways and on our buses and in our prisons, that you’re going to end up losing people that we desperately need,” he said. “Both my grandfathers came to this country during the second world war and the idea that if you come to the UK, then within two and a half years someone could assess that you need to go back? It’s really difficult … we’ve made this point to the government.” The TUC and most trade unions are ending the year in a celebratory mood, with the passing of the Employment Rights Act after months of delay in the Lords. But Nowak said there were significant steps still to be taken to enact the whole of Labour’s Make Work Pay package promised in the manifesto. He said it was crucial that the end to zero-hours contracts was implemented “with real bite” so the onus was on employers to offer fixed hours. And he said the government should press ahead with its consultation on defining a single status of worker to end bogus self-employment. “Bad employers can be incredibly innovative when it comes to insecure forms of employment,” he said. But Nowak said he was most heartened by the passing of the new measures that made it easier for unions to organise in workplaces. “It’s the first time in my 35 years of being a trade union activist and official that any government’s ever repealed anti-union legislation,” he said. For the first time, he expected union membership to rise over the coming years. “I think what this does is move us away from being a minority sport to the mainstream of British workplaces,” he said. Nowak said he also wanted to see the government shout louder about its leftwing credentials, from the employment rights bill, to nationalisation, to the end of the two-child benefit gaps. But he also said progressives who were disillusioned with Labour should engage more, showing what pressure could achieve. “I think we’ve got to make this the best possible Labour government that we can,” he said. “I don’t think, in my job, or anybody who’s really interested in progressive politics, you can treat politics as a spectator sport. It’s not our job to carp from the sidelines, it’s to try to engage the government and lobby them.”",Jessica Elgot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not from the MPs who are packing up to slope back to their constituencies for the Christmas recess, but from the rest of the country. Finally, the year is coming to an end and there will be few chances for our politicians to do any further damage before they return to Westminster in January. The psychodrama is finally done. We can all go to bed vaguely hopeful that the world won’t have taken a further turn for the worse by the time we wake up. By any standards, 2025 has been a momentous year in politics. One clusterfuck after another. Even more remarkably, possibly the first one in decades when Boris Johnson hasn’t got anyone pregnant. As far as we know. But before our politicians leave us in peace, there’s one final ritual to be observed: the Guardian’s parliamentarian of the year awards. A chance to remember just how lucky we are to have such a talented ruling elite. For the first time ever, this award is to be shared between the prime minister and the chancellor. After a member of the Downing Street team rang up various political editors to say that Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Ed Miliband were all mounting a leadership challenge against , Starmer announced that he would be setting up an inquiry into why someone he had authorised to speak to the media had done as he asked. Normally, he can count on his own team’s disloyalty. So Starmer would now be interrogating Starmer on why Starmer had leaked a damaging story about Starmer. And he wouldn’t be taking yes for an answer. was setting up her own inquiry into why she had changed her mind about raising income tax in her November budget. Reeves would also be giving Reeves a strong talking to about why when Reeves leaks something it is called a briefing and when one of her team does the same thing it’s a leak. There was one clear winner. Step forward . The former deputy prime minister bought a flat in Hove and, despite realising that the stamp duty had been complicated by the legal status of her disabled son’s trust fund, she chose to get her tax advice from someone she happened to meet in the pub who had said it would probably be OK. And who wouldn’t do that when you know the rightwing media are likely to be looking for any signs of wrongdoing? Later in the year, Rayner had hoped to recoup her tax liabilities by appearing on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Unfortunately the show’s producers turned her down on the grounds that she was a genuine celebrity and they only took C-listers. Breaking with tradition, the prize this year goes to someone who has demanded a resignation. Encouraged by doing a little better at prime minister’s questions in the past month or so, has taken to calling for the resignation of anyone she meets. Sometimes twice in the same speech. She once insisted that Rachel Reeves should resign for failing to obtain the correct rental licence, only to then insist the chancellor should unresign herself so that she could later resign again for breaking a manifesto promise. The list of people whose resignation Badenoch has now demanded includes the entire cabinet and shadow cabinet. Not forgetting herself. The number of people who have followed Badenoch’s advice is zero. As you might imagine, this is one of the most coveted and hotly contested awards. And it could easily have gone to any one of hundreds of MPs who have been only too willing to abandon their principles to further their career. Though not to Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary who declared that all his colleagues in the shadow cabinet were total nonentities. Pots and kettles, Rich. Instead, the winner for the 10th year in succession is shadow home secretary, . Not for nothing is he known as Westminster’s “Golden Nose in Search of a Bum”. Back in 2016, the Philpster could be founded praising George Osborne’s brilliant economic case for remain. Since then he has gone on to say almost anything to ingratiate himself with the Tory leadership. Probably still the only person to wholeheartedly endorse the This used to be the award no one wanted to win. But in 2025, racism has made a big comeback in politics and is the go-to fashion accessory for every rightwing MP hoping to make it big. It goes without saying that Honest Bob Jenrick and were well up the shortlist. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Nige found it impossible to apologise to black and Jewish men who claim they had been abused by him while at school. One boy had been repeatedly told “Africa is that way” while another was informed that “Hitler was right”. Reform’s main defence is that he was not intentionally racist and in any case all 28 men were liars. Nonetheless, this year’s winner is Reform’s Sarah Pochin, who admitted she needs to projectile-vomit every time she sees a black or brown face in an advert. She now has to take anti-sickness medication before she enters the chamber in case there is a black person on the government benches. She is the gift that keeps on giving. Every time you think she has gone away for good, Liz Truss somehow manages to come back madder and funnier than ever before. Her January appearance filming the presidential inauguration from her Washington hotel after she realised she wasn’t actually invited to the event would have been enough to secure her the prize. But her turn as regular chatshow host on her own YouTube channel has been TV gold. Even by her own standards, this has been gloriously bonkers. Edited by a 12-year-old intern strung out on ketamine, each episode has Radon Liz talking about mad conspiracy theories with people almost as deranged as herself. Nothing is off limits. All levels of racism are welcome.

Perhaps the most beautiful prize ever. I don’t really mind, because I never wanted the prize but they still should have given me the prize. “No man has done more for peace in the history of peace than I have. I’ve ended eight global conflicts. Including the one between Albania and Azerbaijan. That was so big, so big the Albaniainians and the Azzers had no idea they were even at war. No idea. “I blame the BBC. They are going to have to pay me a lot of money for interfering with the democratic process of another country now that my new national security strategy has shown that I plan to interfere with the democratic process of other countries.

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/24/solidarity-and-vigilance-in-british-jewish-community-targeted-by-islamic-state-plot,‘We refuse to be afraid’: solidarity and vigilance in British Jewish community targeted by IS plot,2025-12-24T07:00:06.000Z,"Life goes on in a vibrant Greater Manchester neighbourhood after a plan for an attack was thwarted “They tried to kill us. They failed. Let’s eat,” Andrew Walters said. It is an old Jewish joke that’s as relevant as ever in in the face of today’s threats. For Walters, the independent councillor for Kersal and Broughton Park, Salford, the joke encapsulates the good-humoured resilience that is a defining feature of his Orthodox Jewish community. This vibrant neighbourhood was identified as a target by an sleeper cell, whose plot to “kill as many Jews as possible” in a marauding firearms attack was thwarted. Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein were both been found guilty on Tuesday of terrorism offences. The plot had not shaken the community’s desire to get on with its neighbours, Walters said. “My business partner is a religious Muslim and we get on great,” said the tax adviser and father of nine, who in his spare time campaigns for medical cannabis and to be made widely available on the NHS. “There’s good and bad in any community. Most just want to live in peace.” Saadaoui and Hussein, in common with other extremists who have targeted Jews in Greater , saw the community only through the warped, reductive lens of antisemitism. They were not interested in how lifestyles, incomes, religious practice and political views vary in Greater Manchester’s Jewish communities, as in any other, and how social concerns typical of many British communities, such as poverty, are pressing. Michelle Ciffer Klein runs the Hershel Weiss children and families centre, which supports 650 families – including large ultra-Orthodox families who do not use smartphones, internet or television – and some Muslim women. Ciffer Klein built up the service from one room in a synagogue to a buzzing, council-funded facility offering mother and baby groups, clinics, a Citizens Advice bureau, summer trips, adult education, Hanukah gift drives, food and debt support. In December, it launched the Spread a Little Light project to support community cohesion through Hanukah festivities. “People outside think the biggest issue is security – that’s rubbish,” Ciffer Klein said. “Of course we’re sad and we pray, but women I work with are struggling to cope with day-to-day lives, stress from festivals and lots of babies. We don’t judge. “The cost of living – kosher food is very expensive – energy bills and people who can’t afford to buy milk and nappies, housing, families that miss benefits and can’t put food on the table – that’s what I’m dealing with.” Nonetheless, two unifying themes have strengthened under pressure. One is a clear shift according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research (JPR); the other is a culture of vigilance on a scale unseen in most UK suburbs. “We can get to an incident in two minutes,” said MD Factor, the executive director of the Jewish civilian patrol Salford Shomrim, which shares intelligence with police, acting as a bridge between Yiddish and Hebrew speakers and agencies. “The mood is definitely tense,” Factor added. “We’ve seen a massive increase in calls to our 24-hour hotline about suspicious activities.” Nonetheless, Walters, one of a handful of Orthodox Jewish local politicians in the UK emphasised that Greater Manchester’s Orthodox communities, the fastest-growing in Europe, did not live in fear. “We love life,” he said. “And we believe that if we die, we’re going to a better place. We refuse to be afraid.” Jeremy Michelson, the vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, worked for many years at Manchester’s historic Jewish Museum. He recalled heightened security in north London’s Jewish communities in the 1960s, when “the threat was [neo-Nazi] arson attacks” – but he said he was grateful for the “good life” in Britain. “All we ever wanted from Britain was to give us a chance to live here, practise our faith and contribute – and we’ve done that,” he said. His colleague Sara Radivan, the Board of Deputies’ community engagement officer, added: “I’m proud to be British, proud to be Jewish and can’t say which comes first.” Other prominent British Jews say much more must be done to confront the threat of Islamist extremism. While the Community Security Trust (CST) recorded (175) that demonstrated explicit far-right ideological motivation than Islamist extremism (65) in 2024, and there were more , the most violent plots in recent years have involved Islamist extremists. “A big part of our work on the security side is trying to identify and disrupt hostile reconnaissance of Jewish targets that would precede an attack,” Dave Rich, the CST’s head of policy, said. He added: “The thing about Manchester is, you’ve had the Heaton Park attack and the [Saadaoui and Hussein case]. You had to hold people hostage at a synagogue. You had the guy who went into and stabbed two people because he said Marks & Spencer support Israel. “And you can go back to … . So you’ve got a pattern now of Islamist terrorism and antisemitism coming out of towns and suburbs north of the city. I think there’s a genuine question to be asking: ‘what is going on there specifically?” The Heaton Park synagogue attack came days before the second anniversary of the 7 October attacks in Israel and days before Saadaoui and Hussein’s trial began. Then, not long before the judge was due to begin summing up, two attackers opened fire on Bondi Beach, targeting Sydney’s Jewish community and killing 15 people. News of that attack broke as families across the Jewish diaspora were celebrating Hanukah, observance of which appears to be growing, While rituals and relationships have been strengthened by tough times, others say a postwar paradigm has shifted. Russell Langer, the Jewish Leadership Council’s director of public affairs, said: “From a British perspective, there was sort of a view there was a golden age in terms of post-Holocaust understanding of what antisemitism is, an idea the world saw the evil of the Holocaust and won’t let that be repeated. “I think that viewpoint is starting to be seen as far too optimistic. It’s not that we think this time is any more dangerous than any of those times before, but that there’s no complacency that dangerous times won’t return.” Rich said: “There are people, imams and others, doing the hard work of pulling apart extremist narratives and showing why they’re wrong.” But he said extremists were using “authentic” texts to justify themselves, and moderate Muslim voices faced being “drowned out” and intimidated by hardliners on social media. Langer urged the government to bring forward a new extremism strategy, saying too many people were more comfortable talking about the far right than Islamist extremism. He said: “We have to be careful of the language we use because we are talking about an ideology here; we’re not talking about the religion, we’re not talking about the people. We are talking about a distinct threat.” However, Langer says, against the backdrop of security threats a note of joyful defiance runs through even the most sombre occasions. “In London there were massive gatherings to mark the two-year anniversary of 7 October,” Langer said. “The Manchester [synagogue] attack formed a big part of the conversation in a way that wasn’t planned, but the event itself was to mark the hostages, the people who died on the day. “Unplanned at the end, a musician started playing Jewish tunes as people were leaving and, spontaneously, people started dancing. That’s the positive spin. But I would be lying if I said those serious conversations about the future of Jewish life in this country haven’t been continuing.”",Chris Osuh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/22/britain-economy-brexit-damage-customs-union,Britain’s economy has been damaged by Brexit. But what should ministers do about it?,2025-12-22T14:39:36.000Z,"The idea of a customs union has gained traction, but agreeing a deal would be far from straightforward Almost a decade on from the Brexit vote, the verdict is clear. Britain’s immediate might not have come to pass. But after years of political paralysis – and with the eventual introduction of tougher trade barriers in 2020 – trade, investment and growth in living standards have all suffered. Just as it was on the morning after the 2016 referendum, the big fight is about what the government should do in response. At the weekend, Wes Streeting became the latest frontbench Labour politician to with the EU. His remarks were interpreted as a suggestion that Britain could join a customs union with the EU – something that Keir Starmer has As the UK’s single largest trading partner, the idea has its advocates. UK exports of goods and services to the EU were worth £358bn (41% of the global total) last year. Imports were worth £454bn (51% of the UK total). Under the trade and cooperation agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government, Britain has tariff-free trade with the EU. However, access is limited by other rules and restrictions – and falls significantly short of the UK’s previous membership of the EU single market and customs union. Goods exports in particular have been negatively impacted. Volumes collapsed immediately after the end of the transition period in January 2021, and remain short of 2019 levels in real terms. While this coincided with the Covid pandemic – making it harder to untangle the Brexit impact – economists have shown the UK clearly suffered a weaker period for its trade in goods than for other G7 countries, and that activity would have been considerably stronger under a remain scenario. Services exports to both the EU and non-EU countries also fell in 2020, but have recovered more strongly since. However, for some sectors, loss of access to the single market has had a big impact: , where financial services exports have lost significant market share in the EU. Labour’s manifesto was clear it wanted “no return” to either the single market or customs union. The main stumbling block would be accepting freedom of movement – perceived as a significant driving force behind the leave vote. Instead, the party promised to “work to improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, by tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade” – including a veterinary agreement to ease food trade, a deal to help touring artists, and an agreement on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. In the UK-EU “reset” earlier this year, both sides took a major step towards negotiating these deals. Plans for a youth mobility scheme, as well as cooperation on energy, defence and security were also mooted. However, the economic boost would probably be limited. Any deals will take a considerable amount of time, and potential compromise, to negotiate. The government’s own assessment suggests a veterinary deal and cooperation on energy would boost UK GDP by only about 0.3% by 2040. That is much smaller than the economic cost of Brexit, estimated at 4% of GDP by the Office for Budget Responsibility. A customs union would probably have a bigger benefit. Under such an arrangement, the UK would escape some of the bureaucracy introduced by Brexit – including complex “rules of origin” requirements for exporters to access tariff-free trade, which estimates show add 2-8% to firms’ costs. The Liberal Democrats claim that a “bespoke” UK-EU customs union could deliver a 2.2% boost to the economy, and bring in £25bn a year for the exchequer. The figure is sourced from research by the consultancy Frontier Economics commissioned by , which campaigns for closer EU ties. However, the thinktank warns the findings are modelled on “deep UK-EU regulatory alignment in goods and services” – something that would extend beyond the arrangements of any customs union. Agreeing a customs union deal would be far from straightforward. Rather than “rejoining”, the UK would need to negotiate a fresh agreement – similar to deals done by Brussels with Turkey, Andorra and San Marino. That would open the door to lengthy negotiations about what exactly a UK-EU customs union would look like. Experts say the EU would drive a hard bargain, and that conditions for varying levels of access would be applied – with freedom of movement and budget contributions among potential demands. Under a customs union, Britain would apply the same tariffs on imports as the EU. However, this could mean outsourcing trade policy to Brussels without the UK having formal input into the decision making. This would mean the UK would be unable to offer more favourable deals to other countries – putting at risk post-Brexit agreements. For some advocates, an independent trade policy helped Britain avoid the worst of Donald Trump’s trade war, and has opened up new opportunities. For others, such a loss would be no big deal – given agreements reached by the government so far have been shown to add little to the economy. Most economists agree that closer relations with the EU could boost growth. However, the trade-offs involved will entail years of political wrangling – both on the domestic front, and in negotiations with Brussels.",Richard Partington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/26/outdated-furniture-fire-safety-rules-putting-people-at-risk-mp-warns,"Outdated furniture fire safety rules putting people at risk, MP warns",2025-12-26T05:00:03.000Z,"Millions of households are exposed to materials in upholstered furniture that can release dangerous fumes when they burn The UK is still using extremely outdated furniture fire safety rules, putting people at risk from toxic materials, an MP has warned. Bob Blackman, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fire safety, said the government has failed to update rules that date back to 1988, leaving millions of households exposed to materials that exacerbate the release of dangerous fumes when they burn. “We have been lobbying ministers for years, yet there is still no clear plan to modernise these standards,” Blackman said. A number of chemical groups are used in upholstered furniture – mostly as flame retardants applied to foams, fabrics and backing materials to help furniture meet the UK’s stringent ignition tests. Many of these substances have been linked to toxicity, persistence in the environment and health concerns, with the use of several restricted over time. Europe has undergone major reforms over the past 20 to 25 years that have significantly reduced the use of toxic flame-retardant chemicals in sofas, mattresses and upholstered furniture. These changes were driven by health concerns, environmental evidence and new understanding of how furniture actually behaves in real fires. While landlords are already required to ensure furnished rental properties meet basic fire safety rules, consumers can still purchase secondhand sofas, armchairs and mattresses without any information about what chemicals they contain. The MP warned these everyday household items are kept for decades, and can present fire and toxicity risks long after they are manufactured. “You can walk into a secondhand shop today and buy furniture without knowing the dangers associated with it,” Blackman said. “The cushioning materials used in domestic furniture are often the centre of fire risk, and when they burn, the fumes can be toxic or even lethal.” Most domestic fires begin in living rooms, often triggered by heaters, candles or smoking. The APPG argues that current rules fail to reflect the behaviour of modern foams and fire-retardant chemicals, with experts long warning that many of them can be harmful. “Of course we want fire-retardant furniture,” the MP said. “But we also need to know what chemicals are being released when these materials do burn, and what harm those fumes cause to people, especially children, whose lungs are particularly vulnerable.” intensified concern over the integrity of fire safety checks. Blackman said: “Grenfell exposed deep flaws in how fire-retardant materials are tested. Some suppliers attempted to secure higher ratings than their products deserved. Testing is absolutely critical and at present it is not fit for purpose.” Despite repeated meetings with ministers, the APPG says there has been “no meaningful progress” from the government. The MP noted that the responsible minister “left with a clear understanding that this issue urgently needs attention”, but no updated regulations have been published. The Building Safety Act does give ministers the ability to introduce new rules without requiring primary legislation, but industry pressure remains a hurdle. “Furniture suppliers argue that tightening standards will increase costs,” the MP said. “There is always a tradeoff: if we reduce certain chemicals, does the fire risk increase? That balance must be informed by evidence.” Another concern is environmental disposal. Many sofas and mattresses are incinerated or recycled, yet the fate of toxic gases released during burning remains unclear. “If we incinerate these materials, what happens to the toxins? If we landfill them, what are the risks?” the MP asked. “Consumers buying secondhand items have no idea what chemicals they are bringing into their homes.” While the overall number of domestic fires has fallen in recent years, the MP warned that this should not breed complacency. “We have allowed this issue to drift,” he said. “The dangers are well known, the evidence is clear and the government must act.” Joanna Cloy, from the environmental charity Fidra, said: “As well as increased smoke toxicity when flame retardant materials burn, there is the other pressing issue of exposure to toxic chemical flame retardants in our homes as they migrate out of our furniture over time. People are exposed to legacy chemicals that are now banned as well as their replacements that have been restricted or are being considered for restriction in the EU. “The UK’s chemical restrictions are lagging behind the EU’s chemical restrictions. They must keep pace to address the ongoing failure to protect UK consumers from exposure to toxic chemical flame retardants used in furniture products.”",Sarah Marsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What a shame Labour wavers about saying so arning. This column contains good news, when it is an (un)truth widely acknowledged that only grim stories attract public attention. News must be something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed, says the old maxim. Well, battalions of interests want to suppress good news: the overwhelmingly Tory or Reform UK press and antisocial media sites don’t want any stories to surface that might do credit to a Among this deluge of disinformation and malevolence, when asked, a sour and disengaged electorate struggles to think of anything good this government has done. True, the prime minister and his cabinet are partly to blame for failing to tell their story, paint their picture, draw us a map of where they are going and why. They too often do good by stealth, afraid of what the right and business might say if they dare trumpet the strong social justice themes that drive most of what they do. But lay out what the government has done and there it is, plain as a pikestaff. There have been blunders, missteps, bad timing and wrongheaded manifesto pledges, but follow the money to define its identity. What has Labour raised from whom and how was it spent? That’s what historians will look for. Labour inherited destitute, austerity-stricken public services that voters expected to be healed overnight by a “change” government, despite a stagnant economy, deep debt, unfunded policies and an empty Treasury. Forget Harold Wilson’s verity that a week can be a long time in politics – a year and a half is not very long for the radical changes the government has made already. The list has to begin with Labour’s forever priority: children come first – this time with free breakfasts, cheaper uniforms and 500,000 more qualifying for free school meals in England, and 550,000 due to be lifted out of poverty across the UK with the abolition of the . Nurseries for all is a liberation for families – and crucially a great educational boost, so let’s welcome 1,000 new family hubs in England, resurrecting the Blair-Brown flagship Sure Start policy. Many may not notice, but unsurprisingly I’m told Labour’s own polling finds that families with young children certainly do, when free childcare makes some half a million English families as much as . It may take time to percolate, but these policies are monumental. Also in England you can add to that the restoration of arts to the school curriculum, and the start of a revived youth service with . This is familiar Labour turf: children come first. Other forever Labour beliefs are becoming visible, too: the railways are being renationalised, with rail and bus fares frozen in England, and pay-per-mile for all electric cars by 2028, to help promote public transport. The Employment Rights Act is a founding Labour principle, vastly improving working conditions in England, Scotland and Wales: how were zero-hours contracts ever permitted where people get no notice of their hours or wages each week, unions are barred from workplaces and workforces fired and rehired on worse pay? A new chapter has begun for millions of workers. Of course, business and its press protest – as they do about a by 6.7% in year one, plus another 4.1% in April. That’s a shift in power towards the workforce, after decades of money and muscle transferred to employers, causing soaring inequality. The government braved tidal waves of industry anger when employers, not workers, were made to pay an extra £25bn in national insurance. Yet the message of a pro-worker government fails to reach its target. Instead, a belligerent head of Unite is now joined by an even more anti-government new Unison leader, making a threat to Labour that, “never again will we ”, despite this being the most pro-union government since 1979. The NHS staggers on – but with more than 2,000 extra GPs and 170 new . Net migration has fallen steeply by ), but small boat arrivals rising is bad news. Wages have risen by , but people don’t feel it yet. The Renters’ Rights Act protects 11 million private tenants in England from no-fault evictions.

The , including rejoining Erasmus – the EU’s education and training programme – . Recognising the state of Palestine took too long, but no other UK government did it. For all Donald Trump’s extreme racist abuse of mayor Sadiq Khan, London’s air quality has reached for the first time, crime in the capital (except for phone theft), and in recent years Khan has surpassed his own targets for For flavour, Wandsworth, once Margaret Thatcher’s flagship borough, now has its first Labour council since 1978, : “As a borough of sanctuary and a safe haven for people who have fled war and persecution, let’s show these youngsters some warmth and love,” as he topped up donations to give every refugee child a £50 Christmas gift, unafraid of Reform-spread refugee hate. There’s plenty more, but what’s the use when this is the most unpopular government led by the ever? (Note that the last four PMs have all been the most unpopular during their tenure). Loathing of leaders and politicians is widespread across Europe, opening the gates to demagogues. Blame the near stagnation since the financial crash all those years ago – but there are glimmers of better times from the Guardian’s economics editor, , and the Financial Times economics writer , who says: “The UK economy is not nearly as bad as you’ve been told”. The doom is overdone. What’s missing, as cabinet ministers now say more loudly, is that red thread signalling the nature of this government. Wavering and wobbling, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were never sure about daring to tell that story, peppering it with Reform-wooing distractions. Late, as ever, Labour seems to be shunning of tacking right on some social policies, realising that Too much is still left undone. Where is electoral reform to protect the democratic future? More than 4 million children are poor, the young are losing hope of owning a home, public services are struggling and everything needs money that isn’t there. This often feels like an unhappy country – angry, grudging, cynical. But don’t underestimate a government that’s doing far more than it gets credit for.

Starmer must now feel a sense of deja vu watching , the most out-and-out pretender for the leadership, follow a similar playbook. In an interview over the weekend, the health secretary strayed from the official government line to call for “a deeper trading relationship” with the EU. , Streeting implied that joining a customs union with Europe would give Labour a distinctive message with which to take on To many Westminster observers, the obvious point is that, like Starmer’s intervention in 2018, Streeting’s remarks align him with the Labour members and voters who overwhelmingly support stronger ties with Polling by YouGov published this weekend suggested that 80% of those who backed in 2024 support negotiating a customs union deal with the EU. Seventy-three per cent backed talks to rejoin the EU entirely. Most intriguingly, however, Streeting’s remarks speak to a growing section of Labour MPs – including some senior cabinet ministers – who lament the government’s promised “reset” of EU relations as decidedly unambitious and who believe that going further could be a gamechanger for economic growth. What MPs and ministers have been telling journalists privately for months is increasingly said openly. Before Streeting, David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, and had been beneficial to countries such as Turkey. No 10 has repeatedly ruled this out on the basis that it would rip up the UK’s independently negotiated free trade deals. During their last month, Starmer’s allies briefed journalists that anyone who replaced him would take a more pro-EU approach and jeopardise international relationships, including with Donald Trump. But recent developments in Britain’s trading relationship with the US, which is unarguably the highest-profile benefit of having an independent trading policy, call the advantages into question. The US has over wider disagreements. And as for a deal to avoid threatened US tariffs on pharma, Most importantly, the free trade deal the UK agreed with the US in May – which puts 10% baseline tariffs on British exports, lower than the 15% on European exports – as well as deals with India and other powers may be a publicity win, but they have been deemed to have a negligible impact on economic growth. One senior business figure called them “performative”. All this means that the political imperatives and the economic realities point to one thing. As the parliament slowly trundles on towards the next election and Starmer’s critics circle, the pull of promising to rejoin the customs union will become harder and harder to resist. Prospective leadership contenders, backbench MPs across different factions and Labour’s core voters are all calling for more. Starmer’s No 10 is clear that its manifesto “red lines” ruling out a return to the customs union, single market or freedom of movement – language that already seems hopelessly outdated to some Labour MPs – only apply until the next election. “Hopefully we’ll be in a position to go into the next election saying, look, we have done all we can within the confines of what we inherited,” one minister told the Guardian. “But if we want to push on, then some sort of commercial union with our neighbours may be the next place to go.” Perhaps the biggest practical obstacle, and one that government figures point to in private, is the difficulty of negotiating with Brussels and the high prices it seeks to exact for any concessions. Talks for UK defence companies to play a larger role in the EU’s Safe fund , after strong resistance from France. Negotiations in other areas of the UK-EU relationship including a food standards deal , a full six months after Starmer’s summit with Ursula von der Leyen, because of delays in the EU obtaining its mandate. And the two sides remain far apart in , with Brussels demanding an uncapped scheme and lower fees for European students studying at British universities. The bottom line is, amid the growing clamour to go further and faster, the government faces an uphill battle just to secure the limited things it has already promised.",Eleni Courea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten years after the introduction of shared parental leave in the UK, the policy’s architects said it had failed to deliver on its promise of “ ” and called for bold measures necessary to allow more men – including middle- and lower-earners – to spend time with their babies. New data obtained by the Guardian reveals that in the past five years just one in every 64 requests for parental leave in four of the UK’s biggest public sector employers were for shared parental leave, which gives parents the right to split up to 52 weeks of leave, including up to 39 weeks of statutory shared parental pay. Freedom of information requests made by the Guardian show that just 1.55% of parental leave requests made at those employers in the last five years were for shared parental leave (SPL). From 274,755 requests for parental leave across NHS England, Scotland and Wales, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Work and Pensions between 2020 and 2025, just 4,264 were for SPL. , who introduced the 2015 policy in the House of Commons when she was the minister for employment relations, said low take-up of shared parental leave in public bodies was “disappointing” and blamed successive Tory governments. “It’s definitely a policy that hasn’t achieved its potential, partly because it hasn’t had the kind of the backing, the energy, the encouragement of a government that believed in it,” said Swinson. Campaigners and policy shapers have long argued that the shared parental leave policy is a failure, with a key study from the University of Bath last year finding . Since its introduction, neither the uptake nor the length of paternal leave taken has increased, said researchers. The last Conservative government’s 2023 found that only 1% of eligible mothers and 5% of eligible fathers used it. A growing body of evidence also suggests that shared parental leave has become the preserve of higher earners concentrated in the south-east of England. Analysis of HMRC data by campaign group the Dad Shift, reveals that 95% of shared parental leave in 2024-25 was claimed by , those making more than the average salary of £37,800 a year. reveals a consistent decline in the share of SPL going to the bottom 50% of earners almost every year since it was created. While around one in 10 claims for shared parental leave were made by average- or low-paid dads in 2015, the figure is now closer to one in 20. “A lost decade on, it’s clear shared parental leave is good for a handful of wealthier families in the south-east but just doesn’t work for most working fathers and non-birthing parents,” said George Gabriel, co-founder of the Dad Shift. “In the past decade, who gets time with their new babies has become a clear class issue, with normal blokes priced out of those early weeks and months with their babies, despite a mountain of evidence showing that proper paternity leave is not just good for dads, but mums and babies too.” of the UK’s parental leave system in July was hailed as a “ ” by the House of Commons women and equalities select committee, but MPs warned that “tinkering around the edges of a broken system will let down working parents”. The minister for employment rights, Kate Dearden, acknowledged the current “parental leave system needs improving” and pointed to the review and to measures in the workers’ rights bill that will make paternity leave a day-one right. “No parent should feel they cannot spend meaningful time with their children, and supporting them to do so is essential,” she said. Swinson said a key problem with the current policy was the requirement for women to “give up” some of their maternity leave, and a lack of ringfenced time for dads to spend with their children, and urged the government to implement “take it or leave it” time off work for dads. “The government has to be bold,” she said. “Let’s not have an incremental tweak. Let’s recognise that this hasn’t moved for 10 years – we need a leap at this point.” Baroness JoJo Penn, who worked with Theresa May on the introduction of the policy from 2010, and sought an to increase statutory paternity leave from two to six weeks at 90% of a father’s salary, said: “Ten years on, it’s clear shared parental leave is not delivering on its original aims. Around half a million new parents every year shouldn’t have to wait to be able to have both parents access proper leave when they have a baby.” “The case for change is overwhelming, and at the moment I worry that the government has another year for its review but we won’t get any real change at the end of it,” she said.",Alexandra Topping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plus letters from other readers on how being bullied at school affected them their whole life Peter Ettedgui’s account of the antisemitic taunts he endured as a teenager ( ) reminded me of a simple truth about bullying: the bullied remember far more clearly than the bullies ever do. That’s how trauma works. The moment lodges for one person, yet barely registers for the other. So yes, forgetting is plausible. But failing to apologise when you’re reminded is revealing. “Sorry” is a measure of character or, at the very least, the mark of basic human decency. Earlier this year, I came across someone who had bullied me at school. I’d had a drop or two, so I asked if he remembered reducing me to tears. He didn’t – why would he? But he did manage: “If I did that, I’m really sorry.” And that mattered. It closed a circle I hadn’t realised was still open. A small word, offered without defensiveness, made all the difference. This is why arguments about “banter”, memory or the passage of time ring so hollow. What matters now is whether an adult can acknowledge harm, show contrition and take responsibility. When a public figure responds instead with denial, minimisation and accusations of dishonesty, the missing “sorry” speaks volumes. We should listen to what it tells us. questions the memory of Peter Ettedgui regarding antisemitic and racist comments in the 1970s. I can remember exactly where I was, who I was with and what we were doing when my friend and I (both 13 and overweight at the time) were told: “You two must eat a lot of chips.” This was in 1976. Ours was a direct grant girls’ convent. Bullying by pupils and staff was common. My memory is crystal clear, and that foul, denigrating comment has travelled with me throughout life, despite losing weight and wearing a size 10 since 1977. Sorry, Nigel Farage, but people do not forget. No, Mr Farage. We do not forget upsetting events at school. I am 80, but cannot forget the insults that I got at school because of my facial appearance. They hurt then, and have shaped my life since. Like Peter Ettedgui, I have not spoken out since those days, but I am now. Nigel Farage says “I can tell you categorically that I did not say the things that have been published in the Guardian” ( ), yet he claims that this happened so long ago that people could not possibly remember such experiences. Who is more likely to misremember these attacks: the person who thinks it’s just banter or the traumatised person on the receiving end? In the mid to late 1970s, I attended a private school in Hull for my secondary schooling. As a Jewish child, I was subjected to daily taunts similar to those used by Nigel Farage for the whole of my time there. It was “the language of the time”, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt deeply. It led to me leaving the school at 16, which affected my education. I carried the hurt and shame for years and I can attest to the fact that it is possible to remember those taunts as if they happened yesterday.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/24/farage-criticised-for-direct-bullion-job-promoting-physical-gold-as-pension-investment,"Farage criticised for £400,000 job promoting physical gold as pension investment",2025-12-24T18:00:17.000Z,"Exclusive: Reform leader promotes Direct Bullion – but experts say commodity is not for everyday investors Nigel Farage has been criticised over his £400,000-a-year second job promoting the idea that people should buy physical gold and put it into their pension pots. Farage is paid more than four times his MPs’ salary for the four-hour-a-month job at Direct Bullion, where he has featured in Facebook and YouTube videos. These include reels where Farage explains “how you can protect and grow your wealth with tax-efficient gold” by putting it into self-invested personal pensions. leader’s videos include disclaimers that the value of gold can go down as well as up, or that his comments should not be considered investment advice. He also does not mention storage costs or flag that gold does not bring in a regular income in interest or dividends. One pensions expert, Tom McPhail, a governor of the Policy Institute, described the idea that people should be converting some of their pension into physical gold as “niche” and suggested it was appropriate only for sophisticated investors. “There is nothing inherently wrong with holding actual gold,” he said. “But you have got to look at the transaction and storage costs and the whole thing in the round. It is pretty niche stuff. “For 90% or more of the population, join your workplace pension, go into the default fund, have a mixture of bonds and equities, plus property and cash. Just do that. The people who could be looking at [buying physical gold] should be reasonably sophisticated investors. It’s definitely not for most people and should only be done by someone who understands how physical gold fits into a diverse portfolio.” He added: “You can make the argument that he’s just acting as a billboard, saying, ‘how about investing in gold? Talk to these guys, who will tell you about the details.’ But it does feel quite irresponsible. Farage has a strong brand. Not everybody likes him, but some people really like him. So when Nigel tells you to invest in gold, you might just dutifully do what he tells you. If I were to put all my money in gold, that would be a really high-risk thing to do.” Tom Brake, the chief executive of Unlock Democracy, said he had raised the Direct Bullion videos promoted by Farage with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), asking them to look into whether the online material met its standards and whether it fell under its regulatory orbit. , and pointed to another where he said the disclaimer at the end was in such a tiny font and appeared so fleetingly there was a danger A spokesperson for Reform UK, asked whether it was appropriate for an MP and political leader to suggest people used their pension pots to buy gold without disclaimers that the value could go up and down, or explaining that gold did not bring in regular income or making clear any storage costs, said the party “took pity on the Guardian for not having better things to do with their time than measure font sizes”. Farage said: “For five years I have publicly recommended that people invest a decent chunk of money into gold. Since I began my relationship with Direct Bullion, people that took my advice will have seen returns of over 100% on their money.” Direct Bullion did not respond to requests for comment. Reform UK sources said Farage had a working relationship with Direct Bullion that preceded his time as an MP. Promoting the company’s physical gold bars and coins is one of many jobs Farage has had at the same time as being the MP for Clacton. The Reform leader is a presenter for GB News, and has been paid about £450,000 from that role since entering parliament. He is also a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, bringing £48,000 a year, and a commentator for Sky News Australia, which pays him more than £50,000 a year. Other pensions experts said putting gold into pensions could be part of a diversified portfolio. Kate Marshall, a lead investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Gold can play a useful role in a diversified pension portfolio, but it’s important to keep it in proportion. “We favour gaining exposure through exchange traded commodities (ETCs), such as the iShares Physical Gold ETC, which aims to provide exposure to physical gold. ETCs are one of the simplest ways to invest and can be a low-cost way to add exposure to gold to an investment portfolio.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Today we look at the impact of devolution on growing volatility of party political allegiance ext year will be pivotal in British politics, and 7 May will be the point around which things pivot. Elections to local councils, the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd will give millions of voters across the UK a chance to express party preferences. Their verdicts could imperil Labour and Conservative leaders. In Wales, Labour might be sent into opposition for the first time since devolution. are set to make substantial gains. At Holyrood, is on course for a majority. That would be an extraordinary defiance of political gravity for a party weighed down by nearly two decades of incumbency. In England, both Labour and the Tories risk losing scores of councillors as their vote shares are gobbled up by the . Those results will be taken as evidence that Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch are failing as leaders. But it would be a mistake to filter the results only through that lens. The fragmentation of national allegiances began much longer ago. While electorates have routinely used midterm ballots to punish the party in government, devolution changes the calculus of power. The SNP has shrewdly presented itself as a champion of resistance to remote rulers in Westminster, deflecting accountability for its own record in government. In Wales, Labour benefited from a similar dynamic when Downing Street was in Tory hands. That trick is no longer available. The Conservative threat has receded. , the Welsh first minister, conceded that sharing a party with the prime minister is a handicap in the Senedd campaign. She asked voters to recognise that “Keir Starmer is not on the ballot paper in this election”. Resentment at the concentration of power at Westminster has also been a feature of English politics in recent years, but its manifestation has been less explicitly nationalistic, at least in terms of party affiliation. There was a strong element of English exceptionalism, , in the Eurosceptic movement that came to fruition as the campaign for Brexit. That ideological impulse, unsatisfied by release from EU membership, now fuels support for Nigel Farage’s latest vehicle, with a sharpened anti-immigrant focus. As the name indicates, Reform UK doesn’t limit its ambitions to England alone, but that is a function of historic ambiguity in the expression of English nationalism. The differences between England and Britain, clear in legal and geographical terms, have often been blurred in discussions of culture and identity. The terms were often used interchangeably well into the 20th century. That conflation endures in the minds of some English politicians, even if only subconsciously. That legacy complicates the politics of devolution. England is the dominant nation in the union, accounting for around 85% of the UK’s population and a slightly larger share of the economy. The asymmetry was baked into the 1998 devolution settlement that created the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. The lack of specifically English institutions seemed barely relevant. England had ample representation at Westminster. The Labour government at that time perhaps underestimated the potential for the new devolved institutions to pull at the seams of the union. The new constitutional arrangement was designed with the opposite effect in mind. It was meant to neutralise Scottish nationalism in particular. Complacency was encouraged by Labour’s historical strength in Scottish and . Party identity, transcending the union’s internal boundaries, was supposed to be a countervailing factor, resisting centrifugal forces. There seems to be no prospect of Labour’s Scottish hegemony being restored. In Wales, it is in steep decline. In England, where Labour and the Tories have enjoyed dominance in various regional strongholds, devolved institutions are also proving to be catalysts for disruption. In local elections earlier this year, captured two newly created regional mayoralties – Greater Lincolnshire and the combined authority area of Hull and East Yorkshire. The significance of those gains was submerged in the general scale of Reform UK’s , taking hundreds of seats at local authority level and winning a parliamentary byelection in Runcorn. But more local authorities are due to be combined under the jurisdiction of directly elected mayors, while Labour and Tory poll shares are flatlining. Those are auspicious conditions, not only for Reform UK but for all candidates who stand to gain from the decline of the two big Westminster parties. The institutional architecture of English devolution is a mess, having evolved ad hoc in sporadic bursts. There is no consistency of size or constitutional status between various metropolitan areas and combined authorities. Resolving some of those imbalances is supposed to be the function of the , currently on its way through parliament. The guiding principle, according to Labour’s 2024 manifesto, is to “transfer power out of Westminster”. There will be some devolution of control from Whitehall, but also a consolidation of regional power at the expense of lower tiers of government. The bill is distorted by tension between the declared commitment to decentralisation and Treasury reluctance to cede meaningful control over fiscal levers. There is also conflict between political and economic motives. The theoretical objective of devolution is to give voters greater agency over what happens in their local area. But the government’s preferred method for boosting growth is through infrastructure and , expedited by decisions directed from the centre. Earlier this month, four new mayoral elections due next May were postponed to 2028. Ostensibly that is to allow time to complete lower-tier council reorganisation, but opposition parties have cried foul. An unpopular party certainly has diminished incentive to hold ballots that look likely to devolve power to insurgent rivals. That the Conservatives might also suffer is little comfort to Labour. The duopoly that dominated Westminster for generations is in chronic decline. Change started in Scotland; now Plaid Cymru is driving it hard in Wales. Tinkering with the devolution timetable will not stop the same underlying forces expressing themselves in England. Across the multinational union a new political geography is emerging.",Editorial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The government is being urged to show more ambition as it prepares to publish legislation early next year that will In a letter sent this week to , the communities secretary, and Samantha Dixon, the democracy minister, 19 civil organisations said “a donations cap is the best way to protect our democracy and to rebuild voter confidence in the system”. Its signatories include the Electoral Reform Society, Transparency International UK, Hope not Hate and the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition. The call comes weeks after Nigel Farage’s Reform UK declared it had , the largest donation made by a living person to a British political party. As well as reducing the voting age to 16, ministers are planning to use the elections bill to reduce loopholes in political finance. from shell companies and unincorporated associations and empower the Electoral Commission to issue much bigger fines – increasing the maximum from £20,000 to £500,000. The campaigners’ letter called on the government to use the bill to ban political donations made in cryptocurrency, after similar action taken by Ireland and Brazil. that ministers were exploring doing so amid growing concerns that cryptocurrency donations endanger the integrity of the electoral system because it is difficult to establish where they come from. Farage’s party became the first to accept donations in crypto earlier this year. Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, that banning cryptocurrency donations was “definitely something that the Electoral Commission should be considering” and that it was “very important that we know who is providing the donation”. However, ministers have so far shied away from legislating to limit political donations after last year assessing a proposal by the Institute for Public Policy Research for a Like other major parties, Labour relies on private fundraising to fund its campaigns. Its biggest donors in recent years have included the former Autoglass boss Gary Lubner and the green energy entrepreneur The letter also called on ministers to legislate to introduce automatic voter registration, which is being piloted in Wales. The measure, which Labour officials have been , would mean voters are added to the electoral roll automatically without needing to actively register. the move would improve voter turnout and increase electoral participation by renters and people from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, who are less likely to be registered to vote. Finally, the letter urged ministers to safeguard the Electoral Commission’s independence after the Conservatives legislated to allow ministers to set strategy and policy for the regulator. The signatories warned that the Tory move “creates serious risks of interference and political capture” and that “while it may seem politically expedient to maintain this power while in government, it is essential that independence be returned”. Campaign groups that signed the letter to Reed and Dixon included Generation Rent, The 99% Organisation, Make Votes Matter, the Black Equity Organisation and the website Byline Times. A Transparency International report concluded that in 2023, £56.6m in donations – 66% of the total coming from private sources – came from 19 mega-donors.

Politicians, voters and journalists have made this claim before – when their side has been out of power for a long while, or when an elected government has been unusually dictatorial – and their warnings have usually been overstated. But this time the evidence of a fundamental shift away from a century-old status quo seems stronger. and Tory dominance, two-party electoral contests, the decisive power of a big Westminster majority, the patience voters usually show towards a new government, the predictable pendulum swing between right and left, the red lines between mainstream and extreme politics and even the central role of parliament. , barely bother with the Commons, ignoring the convention that that is where future prime ministers make their names. The current government, despite a bland, diligent leader and some decent policies, is despised by most voters with an intensity that may be unprecedented. In the online spaces where political opinions are increasingly formed, debatable facts, rumours, myths, outright fictions and raw emotions surge back and forth, erupt into geysers of outrage – and then subside into stagnant pools of disillusionment. “Confidence in the system of governing Britain remains at a historic low,” the National Centre for Social Research . “Trust in governments and MPs … [is] lower now than … after any previous election.” In the New Statesman, in October, the veteran commentator Andrew Marr a common establishment view: “Britain has become ungovernable.” Because the old party structures and Westminster’s web of institutions and rituals remain, drawing attention to themselves and still shaping the political calendar, it remains possible, some of the time, to believe that British politics is not really changing. There are also many people with a vested interest in prolonging the old order, from MPs who want to enjoy traditional, extended parliamentary careers, to journalists with mainly Tory and Labour contacts. And then there is the unease many voters may feel, whether they like the status quo or not, about Britain adopting a new, yet to be defined, political culture, in a world increasingly full of hostile states and authoritarians. Contempt for the Labour-Tory duopoly could turn to nostalgia if welcomes Vladimir Putin to Downing Street. Yet until Reform UK – or perhaps an equally untried coalition of anti-Reform parties – is tested and constrained by holding office, then Britain’s new politics remains free to develop in many parallel, largely uninhibited ways. What might these political futures be? Some relatively optimistic centrists and leftists at and the pressure group Compass see the need for an also as an opportunity: to finally begin Britain’s shift to a European-style politics of coalition and proportional representation. Strikingly this year, despite all the government’s troubles and Reform UK’s poll breakthroughs, the combined support for Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens hasn’t fallen much: from 48% in January to 44% now, according to the website . Meanwhile, support for the left-leaning SNP and Plaid Cymru has held steady. The widespread idea that Britain has recently become a much more reactionary country is more of a rightwing hope, and leftwing fear, than a description of reality. But the problem for those who see potential in the poll trends for a long-term progressive majority at Westminster is that this year another, almost equally large bloc has been . The combined Tory-Reform UK vote was 46% at the start of January and is 48% now. With to Reform continuing, the parties’ approaches to immigration and many other issues blurring, and the denials that they will form an alliance sounding steadily less definitive, the prospect is growing of a confrontation – perhaps lasting years – between two multi-party blocs with deeply opposed values. The Brexit wars may come to seem modest by comparison. Our electoral system’s unsuitability for this kind of fragmented and polarised politics adds another new layer of uncertainty. The next general election could see four, or even five – if Reform’s recent dip in the polls continues – parties get a similar number of votes, yet win wildly diverging numbers of seats. A distortion of democracy on this scale has never happened in Britain before. How the winners and losers from such a lottery would react, and how the random quality of the results would affect the legitimacy of whatever government emerges, whether in the eyes of voters, financial markets or foreign states, are questions that Westminster is generally avoiding. The election may not be for another three-and-a-half years: a long time in today’s accelerated politics. During this period of waiting some of Britain’s old political habits could reassert themselves. Some voters may return to the traditional main parties, especially if Farage’s to the allegations about his schooldays proves to be a sign of fragility under pressure. This year, the two once-dominant parties have returned to some old themes. Labour policies such as unapologetically have begun to echo postwar social democracy, while the Tories have returned to their own familiar territory of and promising austerity. If Kemi Badenoch continues to improve as Tory leader, and if Labour can somehow refresh its own leadership, then it’s possible that 2025 will be remembered as the end of an era of intense political instability, rather than its beginning. Yet an even more turbulent late 2020s feels more likely. Voters have so many reasons to stay angry, from depressed earnings to the elevated cost of living. Online politics has been designed by tech companies never to calm down. Meanwhile, in France, the continued , despite successive electoral coalitions constructed to keep it out of office, suggests that such tactics only work for so long. If Reform UK does win power, its record in local government suggests that it, in turn, will struggle to satisfy enough voters. A failed Reform government could then push our politics back into its old comfort zone, or further away from the traditions of British democracy, into the unknown.

Production data published by the Department for Transport (DfT) covering most of 2025 shows that only accounted for 1.6% of fuel supplied for UK flights – 20% less fuel in volume than the 2% needed to fulfil the requirement. The government introduced the mandate in January, which requires suppliers to hit targets for SAF – which the industry has – within the overall UK aviation fuel mix. rises sharply from 2% in 2025 to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040, including the use of second-generation fuels that are seen as more sustainable in the long term. So far, the supply of SAF has been exclusively produced from recycled cooking oil from Asia, predominantly China, the DfT figures showed. The data shows that a little more than 160m litres (35m gallons) of SAF was used, out of 10bn litres of jet fuel burned in UK flying until early October. The DfT said the time needed for verification meant that the figures were provisional, and final figures for the year were not expected to be published until November 2026. A spokesperson for the department said: “These figures do not present the full picture. SAF volumes are continuously rising and not all suppliers have reported on the fuel they’ve supplied.” Planes burning SAF still emit equal amounts of CO in flight, but the net carbon footprint is calculated as far lower because of how SAF is produced, compared with normal jet fuel. Although many scientists and environmental groups remain deeply , production and uptake of SAF is seen as the only way for commercial, and particularly long-haul, aviation to reduce its emissions. While the government has backed aviation as a driver of economic growth and granted permission for airports including to rapidly expand, ministers have promised to consult the Climate Change Committee over plans to build The aviation minister, Keir Mather, told an industry conference in London earlier this month that Heathrow expansion would still have to meet Labour’s four tests, including reducing its climate impact, but that decarbonisation would be “a licence for growth”. He said that SAF represented the biggest opportunity, and the government’s SAF bill, which is passing through the House of Lords, “will deliver the revenue-certainty mechanism that you called for – a guaranteed price for SAF that reduces risks for investors and raises confidence for producers”. Heathrow airport has pushed the uptake of SAF with an incentive scheme that cuts landing charges for airlines using cleaner fuel. It expects to meet its own target of 3% SAF use over the course of 2025. However, airlines have fewer available supplies outside larger hub airports, and have questioned whether future mandates can be met – especially when costlier second-generation and power-to-liquid SAF, yet to be produced at scale, are mandated. The UK has progressed further than most in global aviation. The international airlines body Iata recently warned that growth in production worldwide was stalling, with SAF supplying only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, and forecast to increase to 0.8% in 2026. Iata’s director general, Willie Walsh, criticised the mandates, adding: “If the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.” Duncan McCourt, chief executive of the air industry body Sustainable Aviation, said: “These provisional figures show the UK is using significant quantities of SAF and we remain confident that the mandate will be met and UK aviation will use increasing quantities of SAF in the years to come.”",Gwyn Topham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/26/london-klezmer-dance-band-oi-va-voi-josh-breslaw-steve-levi-interview,Jewish klezmer-dance band Oi Va Voi: ‘Musicians shouldn’t have to keep looking over their shoulders’,2025-12-26T15:00:11.000Z,"After 20 years playing around the world, the group had two UK gigs cancelled this year after protests from activists. It’s made them feel targeted for who they are, the band say osh Breslaw was looking forward to a homecoming gig with his band of two decades’ standing. Oi Va Voi, a predominantly Jewish collective mixing traditional eastern European folk tunes with drum’n’bass and dance, were due to conclude a spring tour of Turkey with a gig in May at Bristol’s Strange Brew club, plus one in Brighton where Breslaw lives. But then, after protests from local activists about both the band’s past performances in Israel, and with Israeli singer Zohara, Strange Brew abruptly cancelled, citing “the ongoing situation in Gaza”. To be told they hadn’t met the venue’s “ethical standards” was devastating, says Breslaw, the band’s 52-year-old drummer: “It felt so unjust.” But worse came when his home-town venue cancelled in solidarity. “It changed how I felt about the city, how I felt about parts of the music industry. And it changed how I felt about the political home I always felt I lived in.” Although the Brighton promoter swiftly apologised, only in November did Strange Brew issue a statement saying it had “made a mistake”, adding that the band likely only attracted scrutiny because they are “a Jewish band performing with an Israeli singer”. Feelings clearly remain raw when I meet Breslaw and fellow band member Steve Levi in north London’s JW3 community centre. It offers everything you’d expect from a neighbourhood arts venue: posters advertising a panto, children’s craft – and one thing found only in Jewish spaces, namely thorough airport-style security frisking at the gate. Since the Manchester synagogue attack, in which two worshippers died in a car and knife attack on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, the community has stepped up already tight security, says Breslaw: buy tickets for a small Jewish play or book reading, and the location may be disclosed only 24 hours before. Levi, the band’s 49-year-old clarinet player, hates the fact they had to hire extra security for a recent gig at north London’s Islington Assembly Hall: “Musicians shouldn’t have to look over their shoulder when they’re on stage.” Although this interview was conducted before the 14 December terror attack on Jews celebrating Hanukah on Bondi beach in Sydney, Australia, at the time of writing the Gaza ceasefire is fragile and the climate in Britain remains febrile. Against this backdrop, Oi Va Voi aren’t alone in their reservations about a regalvanised cultural boycott campaign, which asks artists to sever links with Israeli counterparts in solidarity with Gaza. This longstanding campaign, echoing tactics used against apartheid South Africa, insists it’s strictly peaceful. But the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood – who recently played Tel Aviv – had two UK gigs with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa cancelled after credible threats to the venue. There are signs, too, of the line between boycotting Israelis and targeting Jews blurring. Two British Jewish comedians, Rachel Creeger – whose show is about motherhood – and Philip Simon, had shows cancelled at this year’s Edinburgh festival fringe, over what the venue called staff safety concerns over additional security measures needed. Simon had a second run of shows cancelled after the venue cited his “views concerning the humanitarian situation in Palestine”, including social media posts criticising the actors’ union Equity’s support for a Palestine march. (Simon said he had “never expressed support for anything other than freeing the hostages and finding a path for peace” and that he was being “cancelled just for being Jewish”.) What worries Breslaw is what he sees as the creeping normalisation of the idea that British Jews are somehow suspect. Although he stresses he isn’t in any sense comparing cancellation to the Manchester attack, for him there’s a connection: “It’s deciding that this group of people is responsible for something and they’re a threat, when they couldn’t be further from a threat; they’re a vulnerable group of people that are under attack in this country. And the people who are putting us under attack need to take a look at how that’s happening, because it Oi Va Voi were, he argues, subjected to scrutiny that other musicians aren’t “because we were known as a Jewish band”. And it’s the singling out of a minority on ethnic grounds, in an arts scene that prides itself on inclusion, that he fears. Oi Va Voi formed in the early 00s out of a group of friends experimenting with combining klezmer melodies – folk tunes from their grandparents’ time – and the sounds of their own era, from drum’n’bass to breakbeat, soul and jazz. Breslaw and Levi are the only enduring members of a lineup that was “basically people discovering music that their parents thought was a bit naff”, says the former. But it was also, says the latter, about keeping the old songs alive. Across two decades they have played Glastonbury, won two BBC Radio 3 World Music awards, featured a young KT Tunstall as guest singer and even gigged at the Kremlin (though not for Vladimir Putin, they stress; “I think it was Russian Jewish man of the year or something”). Until May, they’d played across Europe without incident – including in predominantly Muslim Turkey, where some fans went so far as getting Oi Va Voi tattoos. Their music often addresses feelings about exile and migration, with resonance well beyond the Jewish community. Amid the cancellation furore, a young Iranian messaged Breslaw on Instagram, saying he had listened to the band’s 2003 hit Refugee daily before leaving to seek asylum in Germany. “And I was like: ‘OK, these people that are cancelling us have no concept of what we have tried to do with our music,’” he says. “Refugee was always about the human story: how does it feel to be on that journey, to be that lost and alone?” It is against this background that in May, Strange Brew asked them to explain activists’ allegations of playing “occupied Palestinian lands”. (They say they have gigged in Tel Aviv, which isn’t in the occupied territories – though activists who don’t accept Israel’s right to exist sometimes deem the entire country occupied.) There were also objections to the cover of an album Zohara made separately from the band, Welcoming the Golden Age, which featured her naked in a field gathering watermelons in a wheelbarrow. Her bandmates say she meant it only as a statement about “femininity, going back to nature”, and didn’t realise that the cut fruit – whose colours echo the Palestinian flag – has become a popular symbol of Palestinian resistance, especially on western social media. “I’ve spoken to some Israeli people who have never heard of this watermelon thing,” says Levi. Breslaw points out that there are easier ways of determining Zohara’s politics than reading sinister meanings into album covers: in Tel Aviv she’s been a very active anti-war protester, whose recent single denounced the Netanyahu government’s reluctance to end the war. “She’s being criticised not for who she is, what she stands for, but where she was born.” Zohara herself posted on Instagram at the time that the row was secondary to “the only thing that truly matters: ending the starvation in Gaza, bringing all the hostages home and stopping Israel’s bombardments”. Yet at the time Oi Va Voi chose not to defend themselves by taking a stance on the war, and even now they won’t say exactly what they think about it: first on the grounds that British Jews aren’t accountable for a foreign government; and second that they don’t see why they can’t just get on with making music. “I don’t understand this need for all the artists out there to make their statement, as if – if they didn’t make it – people would assume that they must really love the war,” says Breslaw. “Come on, it’s ridiculous.” Nor, he says, do they want their cancellation weaponised for dubious political ends. “We don’t want to be dragged into a culture war from the hard right.” What they will say, to anyone confused as to how British Jews can be offended both by being treated as synonymous with Israelis and by the rap duo Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF” on stage, is that diaspora emotions are complicated. Many British Jews, Breslaw explains, have loved ones in Israel. “That doesn’t mean they support what’s going on, it just means they’re more connected. So if you call for the destruction of that place, it’s going to make people feel worried and uneasy.” Moreover, he won’t rule out Oi Va Voi playing in Israel again. Cultural boycotts can, he argues, isolate and push away the very creatives trying hardest to find solutions. “What does it do to an artist like Zohara who spends most of her time on the streets protesting against her government, fighting really hard, making music that is specifically anti-war? The people in the boycott organisations say: ‘Well there’s got to be some collateral damage’ but no I don’t really see the need.” Although he understands the strength of feeling, “if people think that by cancelling Oi Va Voi or posting aggressive comments [on messageboards] they’re inching closer to solving the Middle East peace process then I think they’re very wrong”. So do they agree with the Jewish protesters calling recently for the cancellation of a Bob Vylan gig in London? “I’m not into the cancelling of things. But I do think if someone wants to play they should be responsible, and they shouldn’t be calling for hate and death,” says Breslaw. Levi argues that the line is crossed “when you’re inciting racial hatred, because that’s illegal”. But mostly, they’re wary of political statements, preferring the music to do the talking. It was Levi’s idea to respond to cancellation with exuberant dance track Back to My Roots, built round a klezmer melody. All about “standing proud, restating what you’re about, that we’re still playing as a band”, it includes synagogue-style cantorial singing and a blast of shofar, the ram’s horn traditionally blown at the Jewish new year. That’s about calling you back to who you are every year,” Levi says. Through several newer songs – including Dance Again, a response to the Nova festival massacre, and the title single from their new album The Water’s Edge – runs the idea underpinning many Jewish religious festivals, of defying adversity with hope. “It’s about a persecuted minority surviving,” says Levi. Returning to live gigging is, for the band, also an expression of that desire not to be erased. But post-cancellation, says Breslaw, some bookers seem wary. “I think it’s just they don’t want the heat of the intimidatory tactics of the people that want to see bands like us cancelled. They think: You know what, it’s not worth the trouble.” He understands the fear of losing business, he says; the sense across the arts world that it may be easier to give in than risk a backlash. “But if everyone does that, where does that leave us?”",Gaby Hinsliff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is barred from the US by the state department after being accused of seeking to push tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints. Ahmed lives lawfully in Washington DC with his American wife and daughter, meaning he is at risk of deportation. Late on Thursday a court a temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him. Ahmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s X Ahmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency. “This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the first and would do so again if asked. “What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said. “There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.” As well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”. Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department, : “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.” The sanctions are being seen as the that target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation. Ahmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said. The next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle. He said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.” The CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”. More recently, the CCDH released a report warning about produced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders. “We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.” Ahmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats. He said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.” There had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that. “The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.” Asked whether he thought UK politicians should continue to use X, Ahmed told PA: “Politicians have to make decisions for themselves, but every time they post on X, they are putting a buck in Mr Musk’s pocket and I think they need to question their own consciences and ask themselves whether or not they think they can carry on doing that.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/26/john-robertson-scruffy-unfit-genius-nottingham-forest-scotland-coach-player,"John Robertson was a ‘scruffy, unfit’ genius who did not get the kudos he deserved",2025-12-26T11:05:32.000Z,"Forest great was loved in Nottingham but underappreciated in Scotland before going on to thrive as a coach n the eve of a Celtic European tie 25 years ago, Stiliyan Petrov cut an increasingly agitated figure. The young midfielder, soon to shoot to prominence under Martin O’Neill, was finding it impossible to snatch the ball from a rotund, wizened coach during a possession drill. Petrov’s teammates were cackling with laughter. John Robertson’s brilliance was understated enough in . Word of his talent in the game was never likely to reach Petrov as he grew up in Bulgaria. Petrov is part of a recent generation who owe a debt of gratitude to Robertson the coach. More of them later. When news of filtered through on Christmas Day, the prevailing sense was that his country had lost one of a kind. He was also an individual who, for reasons associated with his own modesty, really never received the kudos he deserved in the land of his birth. Robertson was two-footed (albeit much more devastating with his left), capable of a bamboozling switch of pace over five yards and a wondrous crosser. He was Brian Clough’s favourite, for goodness sake; a footballer key to two crucial European Cup final goals. It is a pity that only now may Robertson be properly cherished in Scotland. Robertson was very different in style to Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish. It should not be sacrilege to suggest he was their footballing peer. There has never been any worry in Nottingham about Robertson’s contribution being unheralded. Robertson was adored there, almost from the moment Clough instigated a positional switch – central midfield to the left flank – and ordered this 22-year-old to at least moderate a lifestyle which revolved around fags and a frying pan. Robertson was an outside left rather than a winger, a player who made the improbable look so blissfully easy. Clough gave him scope to do as he pleased. In Forest’s halcyon days, Robertson was among the best in Europe. Clough’s depiction of Robertson in his autobiography was unsparing, as a “scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time”. Indeed, Robertson had been on the transfer list (where he was barely attracting attention) until Clough sprinkled magic dust. The Scot could, however, assert the benefit was mutual. Robertson at his peak was so heavily influential in Clough’s triumphs. Robertson’s depiction of his finest goal does not involve the 20th minute in the Santiago Bernabéu on 28 May 1980. The solitary goal as Forest successfully defended the European Cup against Hamburg was nudged into second place by events against England at Wembley the following year. Davie Provan plays through Stevie Archibald, who is knocked over by Bryan Robson. “I screamed: ‘Penalty!’” Robertson recalled. “Then I thought: ‘Oh God, I’m taking it.’” Club loyalties counted for nothing as Trevor Francis – whom Robertson had set up when Forest won the European Cup in 1979 – ran 30 yards to issue words of advice to Joe Corrigan in the England goal. Robertson duly sent Corrigan the wrong way. Scotland have won at Wembley once since. Robertson’s 28 caps feel like scant reward for his brilliance, even from a time when international fixtures were less common and Scotland had an abundance of options. He featured in two World Cups (openly admitting he did not enjoy the 1978 version), with the fact his national service spanned only five years – 1978 to 1983 – explaining the low tally. O’Neill and Robertson were to become great friends. There was a strand of jealousy, though, when O’Neill bit back at a Clough half-time tirade. O’Neill questioned why Robertson was always spared criticism despite occasional selfishness or wastefulness. “Because, young man, that lad is a bloody genius,” Clough retorted. And Robertson was, while insisting he was only the second-best player to emerge from the Viewpark estate in Uddingston near Glasgow. It is for others to determine whether Jimmy Johnstone or Robertson was the superior export. That is one hell of a debate. Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis plans to rename one of the stands at the City Ground in John Robertson's honour. Robertson – who died on Christmas Day, aged 72 – became a Forest idol with standout moments in the finals of their 1979 and 1980 European Cup triumphs, providing the assist for the winner in the former and scoring the only goal in the latter. Marinakis paid tribute to the former Scotland winger and has proposed rechristening the Bridgford Stand to reflect his achievements at Forest, where Robertson also won the First Division title, the Uefa Super Cup and two League Cups. Marinakis wrote on X: ""This week is one of profound sadness for everyone connected with Nottingham Forest as we come together to mourn the passing of John Robertson, a true legend of this great club in every sense of the word. ""Today, I have recommended to the board that the Bridgford Stand be renamed 'The John Robertson Stand' in his honour and in lasting recognition of his extraordinary contribution to our club, so that his legacy, and our great hero, will forever be remembered."" Clough’s faith in Robertson was absolute. For a manager prone to such whim, that has always been intriguing. O’Neill displayed similar trust; the duo formed a great bond at Wycombe, Norwich, Leicester, Celtic and Aston Villa. Robertson’s strength as a coach was in earning the trust of players who loved his style. No airs or graces, no bullshit, but a deep understanding of the game and its actors. O’Neill trusted Robertson’s judgment implicitly. That Celtic squad especially was one with strong characters. One of them, Chris Sutton, has described Robertson as a “mentor”. Sutton, Petrov and others quickly came to learn exactly who Robertson was when the man himself would never have told them. With O’Neill such an adept frontman, it suited Robertson perfectly to linger in the shadows. There was background tragedy of which Robertson rarely spoke. His brother and sister-in-law were killed in a 1979 car crash in a vehicle Robertson had gifted to them. Robertson scored a diving header against Cologne days later. He reckoned his own father died of a broken heart within a year. Robertson’s daughter, Jessica, died at 13 in 1996 having been born with cerebral palsy. Robertson’s switch to Derby famously caused an irreparable row between Clough and Peter Taylor. Clough was in the wrong by leaving his player with at least the sense he was not wanted any more amid recovery from a knee injury. Taylor used an element of inside knowledge to offer a three-year deal. Clough’s outrage would have been better aimed closer to home. Robertson regretted going to Derby – a move made against the advice of his wife – with his thoughts in that period understandably dominated by Jessica’s health. It was no wonder his playing career fizzled out. It is poetic that O’Neill returned to manage Celtic, successfully, on an interim basis so recently. The club has changed beyond all recognition since his first tenure. The makeup of his coaching staff had to, as well. Still, it is to be hoped that Robertson was well enough to enjoy his close friend, at 73, rolling back the years with victories and in sparkling fashion against Feyenoord. The Scottish champions described the O’Neill and Robertson alliance as overseeing “one of the most successful periods in Celtic’s history”. Those five years marked the only spell from 1970 until 2025 when Robertson did not live in the Nottingham area.

https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/dec/23/unsung-alternative-cotswolds-leicestershire-welland-valley-market-harborough,‘An unsung alternative to the Cotswolds‘: exploring Leicestershire’s Welland valley,2025-12-23T07:00:49.000Z,"This hidden gem has country inns, canalside walks, a stunning viaduct, the historic town of Market Harborough – and not a tour bus in sight t was a chilly Sunday in November 2000 when the gods chose to smile on Ken Wallace. The retired teacher was sweeping his metal detector across a hillside in Leicestershire’s Welland valley when a series of beeps brought him up short. Digging down, he found a cache of buried coins almost two millennia old. He had chanced upon one of the UK’s most important iron age hoards, totalling about 5,000 silver and gold coins. More than 25 years on, I’m staring at Ken’s find at the civic museum in the nearby town of Market Harborough. The now gleaming coins are decorated with wreaths and horses. They’re about the size of 5p pieces, but speak of a wild-eyed age of tribal lands and windswept hill forts. Hidden riches are something of a local theme here. The treasure was unearthed close to the Leicestershire-Northamptonshire border, in a sloping, sheep-dotted landscape where the River Welland ribbons eastwards in no special hurry. The town (“people just call it Harb”, one of the museum staff tells me) is the main settlement in this stretch of the valley. I’ve come here on a short winter visit to see why the area – hills, villages, Harb and all – gets described as an unsung alternative to the Cotswolds. The town itself has ancient Saxon roots and is easy to like, with a head-turning mix of Jacobean, Georgian and Victorian architecture. I stumble on , a cracking independent bookshop tucked down an alleyway, then devour a curry bowl at a lively cafe called . A board on the street lists notable town residents through the ages, the most recent being rugby giant Martin Johnson. I read this, then turn and immediately see him on the pavement 10 metres away. It’s unclear if this clever routine is something he does for all visitors, but he’s hard to miss in any case. The real pull of the Welland valley is the countryside, a slow-moving world of hushed green dales and drifting red kites. On local advice, I head to rural – Britain’s highest combination of staircase canal locks, where 10 adjacent early 19th-century locks transport boats up and down a 23-metre hillside – for a gawp and a wander. “It takes 50 minutes for boats to get from one end to the other,” says volunteer Malcolm, who seems delighted to have a visitor to talk to. The neatly painted locks rise up handsomely beside us. You need a decent woolly hat to go gongoozling (that is, canal-watching) in December, but there are rewards to be had. The skies are already fading to a wintery grey when I climb past the locks to the upper towpath. The narrowboats I see are moored up, their chimneys smoking and their roofs decorated with bums-out gnomes. I walk the path for an hour of rippled quietude, passing little other than moorhens and blackthorn sloes, then return the same way. Back at the locks I stop at tiny canalside pub , where I find a crackling log grate and a row of Camra certificates. The barman pours me a Widebeam bitter from Langton Brewery. “Local ale,” he says. “From three miles up the way as the crow flies.” Proof, it turns out, that beer doesn’t have to travel far to hit the spot. My base is nearby Medbourne, one of numerous placid, calendar-pretty villages that stud the Welland valley. Medbourne has a clear stream, a lovely pub – the , where I spend the night in a four-poster and enjoy exactly the kind of warming, candle-lit dinner you’d want from a country inn in winter – and cottages built of tough, reddish Leicestershire ironstone. The next morning I meet local author and poet Tim Relf for a three-hour footpath ramble in the hills. Crossing stiles and ridge-and-furrow fields, he leads us to a spot above his home village of Drayton, from where the valley’s rolling green folds reveal themselves to the full. “You can make out six churches from here,” he says. He’s right. Their medieval spires punctuate a view that tumbles out for miles in all directions. Drayton itself is home to the smallest of these churches, a stone chapel with pews that seat about 25 people. It once spent time as the village bakery and still has a bricked-up serving hatch. “The vicar likes joking about the fact that Bethlehem translates as ‘House of Bread’,” Tim smiles. Close by, they’re used to far bigger crowds at the hilltop . In early summer, the Grade I-listed hall draws thousands of opera and music lovers for its annual arts festival, though when we pass it on this midweek December morning its trimmed lawns and topiary are as quiet as everywhere else. We finish in Great Easton, another village of thatched roofs and wide lanes. It has a little cafe, aptly called , where I refuel on coffee and sticky spiced ginger cake before heading to on the village outskirts. It’s a glorious spot for winter birding – teal, wigeon and great white egrets in the shallows, a 200-strong flock of lapwings billowing overhead – and completely uncommercialised, with a tiny car park and just one other birdwatcher. He’s excited at seeing five smew a little earlier. I give it an hour and don’t see them, but still leave feeling enchanted. Even a short trip needs a finale, which comes in the form of the extraordinary Harringworth Viaduct. I’m staggered when it comes into full view. The viaduct is a bona fide marvel of Victorian mega-engineering, a colossal 82-arch span stretching right across the valley. Glinting beneath it is the River Welland itself, looping and languid. It seems improbable that such an attractive valley should be hiding in plain sight in the middle of the country, but there’s not a tour bus to be seen. A treasure, indeed.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/26/loyalty-over-all-trump-was-once-known-for-constantly-switching-out-his-staff-not-anymore,‘Loyalty over all’: Trump was once known for constantly switching out his staff. Not any more,2025-12-26T13:00:10.000Z,"The president’s professed satisfaction with his cabinet may reflect how hard it would be to get a replacement confirmed or more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House, did not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet. But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show , appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing. Whereas his first term was marked by chaos – his first 14 months saw the of any president for a century – his second has been comparatively stable, with a team remaining almost entirely intact. “I think my cabinet is fantastic,” Trump said recently, dismissing reports of dissatisfaction with his defence secretary, , or his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. “I read these same stories that I’m unhappy with this one or that one – and I’m not. I think the cabinet has done a great job … We have just a fantastic cabinet.” That confidence has persisted despite a steady drumbeat of controversy. Hegseth has come under scrutiny for his misuse of the Signal messaging app and handling of military operations in the Caribbean. Noem has faced criticism over her extravagant spending and with the border czar, Tom Homan. The FBI director, Kash Patel, has drawn over his stewardship of sensitive investigations, while the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, raised eyebrows earlier this year after warning, in a video message, that the world was “on the brink of nuclear annihilation”. The closest brush with dismissal came when the then national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was quietly replaced by Marco Rubio – only to be for US ambassador to the United Nations. Critics say the reason is simple: the president has assembled a court of loyalists, bound less by institutional independence than by personal allegiance. They point to in which secretaries strive to outdo each other by lavishing bountiful praise on their boss. , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “They’re functioning in an environment now when it’s loyalty . If you are loyal and a fighter, the scales will tend to tip in your favour, even if you make mistakes. The mistakes are secondary and the loyalty and constant aggression are primary. I’m sure Trump loves the fact that Hegseth never backs down, never admits error.” There are further reasons for Trump to say you are fired. Axing a cabinet member would mean having to find a replacement, and that could involve a messy confirmation process in the Senate. Even when Trump was at the zenith of his power earlier this year, Hegseth was while Gabbard and Robert F Kennedy Jr, now the health secretary, cleared the bar by two. Now, with Trump’s approval rating plummeting and midterm elections looming, the Senate might prove more sceptical about the president’s unconventional choices. Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to Bill Clinton, added: “It’s fair to say that in Congress are less compliant than they were a year ago because they have surely noticed that the president’s standing with the public has declined remarkably and that they could be dragged down with him. “You can imagine that the confirmation proceedings would be arenas for unfavourable reviews of what had happened in those departments or agencies under the prior leadership during the first year, and that wouldn’t be good either.” , a former Republican strategist, agreed. He said: “Trump knows at this point there are fewer possibilities for a Senate confirmation for the kind of people he wants now. He’s not going to get another Hegseth, he’s not going to get another Gabbard, he’s not going to get another RFK Jr. Those days are done.” In addition, Trump does not want to admit that he made a mistake. Wilson, a co-founder of , an anti-Trump group, added: “Trump doesn’t want to fire anybody. The reason is he feels like that lets the media win. He thinks the media gets something when he fires people.” The president’s restraint this time around marks a contrast with a first term punctuated by high-profile sackings: the FBI director James Comey, dubbed “the worst leader in the history of the bureau”; White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, abandoned on a rainy tarmac; and secretary of state Rex Tillerson, reportedly dumped while sitting on a toilet. No one embodied the turmoil and turbulence better than Anthony Scaramucci, dismissed as White House communications director because of a crude verbal tirade against other members of Trump’s staff. The difference now is partly one of familiarity. Trump 1.0 appointed figures such as Jim Mattis, a revered former general whom the president barely knew and who later resigned as defence secretary over foreign policy disagreements. Hegseth, by contrast, has been in Trump’s orbit for more than a decade and is an unstinting praise singer. , co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, said: “This time around the reason you don’t see the same amount of firings is because the sycophancy is the point. Trump has loaded his cabinet up with people who are loyalists first and foremost and not competent. “He’s neutered Congress in a way that is unprecedented. With the combination of lack of accountability and loyalists at a level we didn’t see in the first term, it’s not a surprise that you haven’t seen high turnover. They’re doing everything Trump wants them to do at great expense to the country.” But there have been purges of a different kind. Trump began his presidency by encouraging millions of federal workers to resign and has removed holdovers from advisory councils, while the justice department has dismissed dozens of career prosecutors – including those linked to investigations involving Trump himself.",David Smith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/27/best-2025-hidden-gem-underrated-songs,The best songs of 2025 … you may not have heard,2025-12-27T11:02:35.000Z,"From a folk murder ballad to an impassioned call for peace, Guardian writers pick their favourite lesser-heard tracks of the year There is a sense of deep knowing and calm to Not Offended, the lone song released this year by the Danish-Montenegrin musician (also an earlier graduate of the currently producing every interesting alternative pop star). To warmly droning organ that hangs like the last streak of sunlight above a darkening horizon, Milovic assures someone that they haven’t offended her – but her steady Teutonic tenderness, reminiscent of or Sophia Kennedy, suggests that their actions weren’t provocative so much as evasive. Strings flutter tentatively as she addresses this person who can’t look life in the eye right now. “I see you clearly,” Milovic sings, as the drums kick in and the strings become full-blooded: a reminder of the ease that letting go can offer. In a year that saw the , there is something endlessly comforting about a song that can only have been written by a messy, complicated human. The first lines of Al Olender’s delightfully specific Cyclone, draw on a memory of driving to Queens to “try to get laid”, and from there the song takes our unwinding narrator to a Baltimore freeway, Planet Fitness bathroom, and, yes, the titular Coney Island attraction. It’s a well-trodden theme, though usually sung by classic dude troubadours such as Townes Van Zandt or Merle Haggard: no matter where she runs, she’s herself, and it’s a problem. But the song’s crescendo is one of the prettiest, and lasting, that I have heard in a while. After losing love (or maybe it was just some guy), the singer resolves to replace all of her glass with paper plates – “things I cannot break”. The most transfixing song too few people heard in 2025 has actually been around for nearly 300 years. Long Lankin, an insanely violent traditional folk murder ballad, has been performed by musical ghouls since at least the 1750s. Far more recently, its dark soul has been conjured by trad stars as esteemed as and Steeleye Span. Never, however, have I heard a version as bone-chilling as the one by the English , her first album co-credited to her longtime partner in music, life and, for all I know, crime, Gerry Diver). Knapp’s quavering soprano manages to sound, at once, pristine and menacing, a silky ghost of a thing equally skilled at seduction and threat. The clarity of her tone has a Sandy Denny purity, but her vibrato portends imminent danger, underscored by Diver’s creepy-crawly glockenspiel and Pete Flood’s spooky drums, which have the jazzy surprise of Terry Cox’s work with Pentangle. While the musicians orchestrate the shifting perspectives of the lyric, Knapp delivers a vocal so arresting, you won’t know whether to shudder or swoon. Roba El-Essawy AKA MidnightRoba was the soulful voice of 90s British trip-hop band Attica Blues and has more recently been releasing music solo, including 2025’s self-released second album, Raise A Symphony – a call for “peace, love, justice, solidarity, righteousness, compassion, empathy and care”. Lead track Axis, produced by El-Essawy, is a maelstrom of splintered, IDM-style electronica, hypnotic interlocking loops, skittering, restless rushes of tabla and operatic vocals in tribute to the children who’ve been killed in Gaza and those grieving them. It features the guest incantations of poet, actor and activist Saul Williams, who has been nominated alongside New Age maestro at the upcoming Grammys and with whom El-Essawy recently performed at the Pitchfork London festival. An anthem for screaming into the void when it feels like no one is listening. As Williams says on the track: “It’s beyond exhausting.” There is a tiny handful of blurred or obscured pics of Cleyra out in the world and even less biographical info, beyond the fact they’re a producer from Bristol in the UK. Perhaps that’s all to the good, allowing for greater mystery and deeper immersion into their mist-wreathed music, which seems to drift through the walls of a multi-room nightclub like an ex-raver in purgatory. Their album-length EP remember this body? features five universally strong tracks, from the reggaeton-adjacent Conundrum to the post-R&B soundscape Just Can’t Live Without Ya and three flavours of techno in between, including the 17-minute There’s Nothing Happening Between Us. That long runtime allows for a proper trip, as 4/4 drums chart a course through a murky sea with explosions emanating from the deep, before surfacing into cleaner drum programming and alarm sounds, as if returning to consciousness in an unfamiliar ambulance. Then ambient techno carries you back into a stupor. Few other dance producers attempted anything quite so ambitious in a single track this year. New York’s humble neighbor to the east in the form of New Jersey has produced plenty of Italian American singing talent. (Looking at you, Sinatra). Now, 14 year-old Dom Innarella prepares to take the stage. His smooth falsetto originally launched him into TikTok-viral fame with listeners comparing him to a young Justin Bieber. Now, his own version of may not be far behind. (Innarella-mania?) His past year was a big one, with the singer signing with Republic Records and releasing a series of throwback pop and R&B singles that harken back to Bieber’s early days. Aside from his breakout Bout Me and a recent cover of It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas, Inarella’s acoustic and drum machine-driven Call Me reminds one of Usher’s glory days. No wonder why he’s from the man himself, along with J Balvin and Teddy Swims. With a debut album on the horizon, the future could belong to another voice from the Garden state. Jammy is an artist I first encountered back in 2017 with , a sad, post-summer ode to dreaming of a love that fades when the sun stops shining. It remains under-heard (a music video with fewer than 30,000 views, the Google search “jammy margarita” leading to recipes for a margarita with jam) but it’s a monster hit compared with his EP this year. The best track, , hasn’t even hit 60 views on YouTube (!) with a Spotify count not even notable enough to register (the artist himself only reaches under 3,000 listeners a month). It is therefore something of a public service for me to bring it to light, another mellow and lightly melancholic winner about a lost love, this time one who’s now in a new thankless relationship and maybe needs the help to get out? Or maybe he’s just fooling himself, a sense of delusion running through his back-and-forth, gently switching between cocksure and vulnerable. It’s too good to be kept a secret. “The truth is I don’t really like myself / And the truth is I don’t really like anyone else” is an opening gambit so direct it almost dares you to flinch. But Walk Away never sinks into a confessional wallow; it keeps strutting forward as if refusing to grant despair the dignity of stillness. Annika Henderson’s voice arrives coolly detached, half-spoken, half-sung, floating above bright, jangling guitars whose breeziness feels deliberately mismatched to the venom in her words. That tension is the point. The Berlin-based hybrid artist – and former journalist – has always understood the power of saying things plainly, and Walk Away reads like column inches finally allowed to shout. It’s a four-and-a-half-minute anthem of irritation and self-loathing that somehow lands as liberating rather than bleak, its grunge-inflected pulse recalling the reckless candor of 90s alt-rock without leaning into nostalgia. The chorus doesn’t explode so much as sharpen, circling the same unsparing truths until they start to feel oddly cathartic. In an era of hyper-managed vulnerability, Walk Away is refreshingly unfiltered: a song that refuses both likability and apology, sounding all the better for it.",Laura Snapes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/26/the-lowdown-review-ethan-hawke-disney-plus,The Lowdown review – Ethan Hawke’s new drama is hilariously poignant,2025-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,"The actor plays a ‘truthstorian’ trying to uncover how a powerful man’s death came about. Brace yourself for a hugely funny, all-American wild goose chase! ee Raybon (Ethan Hawke) is a “truthstorian”. How to explain that proudly self-applied title? A historian, but also an investigative journalist with an inherent distrust of mainstream narratives? A maker of trouble for trouble’s sake? Or one of those fantasists whose home contains a huge mood board (current mood? Paranoid!) covered with photos of suspects and newspaper clippings and various strands of a conspiracy connected by pieces of string? Raybon actually has one of those. “I’m a very visual thinker,” he says. His scathing former business partner Wendell (Peter Dinklage) sees it differently: “It’s like you read one Oklahoma history book and then made a junior high collage out of it.” This exchange is typical of the alacrity with which The Lowdown cheerfully undercuts itself. Sterlin Harjo’s Tulsa noir is brilliantly elusive in tone. It allows Raybon, its nominal hero, precious little dignity. Raybon is, in many ways, a ridiculous man. His marriage is in ruins. He puts his sweet, resourceful daughter Francis in danger by mixing business and parenting. He’s one of the least physically imposing renegades you’ll ever meet (“How does an adult with a gun get put in the trunk of a car?” wonders his associate Cyrus at one point). He isn’t Woodward or Bernstein, he’s Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski with a sympathetic editor and a political agenda. The Lowdown is frequently very funny; working as both a genre piece (in which the genre in question is fondly spoofed) and as a character study (which follows a similar trajectory of amiable mockery). And yet, as with Harjo’s previous show , there’s something profoundly serious going on here too. The mystery at the drama’s heart involves the powerful Washberg family whose wayward offspring Dale has taken his own life – or anyway, that’s their story. It seems likely that he has died – at least indirectly – as a result of an article Raybon has written. So there’s a follow-up to be explored about the circumstances of Dale’s death but also potentially about the older Washberg, Donald’s predatory designs on Indigenous American land and Black-owned businesses in the area. This is Harjo’s subtext. Tulsa is a city with a dark history. – in which up to 300 Black citizens were murdered by white supremacists – is a barely acknowledged but omnipresent undertone. The distinct aroma of white saviour surrounds Raybon at all times. “White men that care,” mutters Cyrus. “The saddest of the bunch.” Harjo, meanwhile, is an Oklahoma native in the most fundamental sense. He’s a citizen of the Indigenous American people, the Seminole nation of Oklahoma. Reservation Dogs was about a beleaguered Indigenous community and how it managed to support itself in the face of white hostility – and arguably worse still, indifference. The Lowdown isn’t even nearly a follow-up in terms of subject matter but it could be regarded as a companion piece – the same territory and power structures, viewed from a different angle. Raybon’s good intentions are weighed down by their historical context. But even if Raybon is constantly failing to outrun the past, there is still real generosity in Harjo’s characterisation. Raybon is a driven man at least partly because the most important thing is to keep trying. Harjo specialises in earnest, ardent goofballs. People who are on the side of the angels but who remain endearingly daft. People who hold firm to their principles and take themselves extremely seriously. Like the idealistic, charming teens in Reservation Dogs, Raybon will never let his own absurdity cause him to take his eyes off the prize. The fact that Raybon doesn’t really understand what that prize might be is a big part of the fun. What unfolds is an all-American wild goose chase, populated by an ensemble of memorable picaresques. The supporting performances are uniformly superb – from Keith David’s blunt gumshoe Marty to Kyle MacLachlan’s oily Donald, everyone brings something sweet or sinister, funny or peculiar to the table. Meanwhile, Raybon blunders around, stumbling uninvited into private meetings, getting beaten up (repeatedly: he becomes progressively bruised and dishevelled as the series goes on) and drunkenly falling into bed with Donald Washberg’s dissolute ex-wife Betty Jo (the brilliant Jeanne Tripplehorn). Raybon imagines he is fighting to preserve an idea of progressive America, but he’s hanging on to something in himself too. Eventually, The Lowdown is a poignant and surprisingly personal story, about purpose and ageing and noble failure; about the timeless truth that the journey is more important than the destination. “There’s no cat up in that tree he’s barking at,” suggests his antiquarian book dealer friend Raymond. But even if Raymond is right, Raybon has to keep barking all the same. What else is a Truthstorian to do? The Lowdown is on Disney+ now.",Phil Harrison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain the upper hand, he hosted a grand party the night before the match at which he served his guests Patiala pegs, famously generous four-finger whisky pours traditionally measured from pinky to index finger. Unsurprisingly, the English players overindulged, leaving them very hungover and, inevitably, defeated the next day, and the legend of the Patiala peg was born. This Punjabi kind-of old fashioned is inspired by Singh’s drink. At the restaurant, we serve it from a bespoke five-litre bottle, but we’ve adapted the recipe to make it more suitable for a domestic environment. Put everything in a large bottle or jug, add 130g water, stir to combine, then put in the fridge, where it will now keep for up to three weeks.

Comanche held a narrow advantage of four nautical miles over LawConnect, which is aiming for a third straight first-past-the-post win, in Bass Strait at 5.30pm on Saturday. The retirement list grew further on the second day of sailing, with one of the favourites for the handicap crown, URM Group, forced to pull the pin with hull damage about 4.30pm. It is the second time in as many years the 72-footer has retired after it was dismasted in 2024 and had to motor seven hours back to safety for repairs. URM Group reported all crew were OK and the boat was making a six-hour trip to the NSW south coast. The overall retirement tally sat at 15 by Saturday evening, including supermaxi Wild Thing 100, which suffered rigging issues off the NSW south coast in the early hours of the morning. Crews have battled uncomfortable and seasickness-inducing upwind conditions, which are expected to ease into Sunday. Andy Green, navigator for Comanche, which is seeking redemption after being forced to retire with mainsail damage in 2024, said he was expecting winds to lighten closer to Tasmania. LawConnect was first out of Sydney Heads on Boxing Day, but surrendered her lead after tacking out to sea after 6pm on Friday. “We’re keeping a good close eye on them and a nice cover on any radical strategy they might do to try and force a decision on us,” Green said. LawConnect, skippered by Christian Beck, was forced to contend with a broken mainsheet and halyard on the first night. “It’s been a tough night, we had a lot of breakages,” he told AAP. “It’s been quite difficult. We’re still together, we’re still in the race.” LawConnect crew member Chris Nicholson said it had been “a bit of a horror show” after the yacht lost its wind instruments at the beginning of the event. “[We were] looking forward to daylight so we could see the sails again,” he said. An afternoon line-honours finish on Sunday is on the cards, well behind last year’s 2.35am arrival and the race record of one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds set in 2017. Supermaxi SHK Scallywag and American 88-footer Lucky were in second and third, with NSW’s Palm Beach XI a touch further back in a remaining fleet of 113. Wild Thing’s withdrawal was gutting for veteran skipper Grant Wharington, who oversaw significant upgrades to her this year. Wild Thing was third on line honours in the deadly 2024 Sydney to Hobart, even with a smaller rig than usual for a 100ft supermaxi, and had a larger one installed in May. “Very disappointing, this morning about 3.30 we were trying to repair a problem with the rudder,” Wharington said. “We got that fixed but we just weren’t happy with the set-up. We kept breaking runner tails and had some other rigging issues as well. “Conditions were pretty testing and we lost quite a lot of time in trying to fix those problems, so we decided it was prudent to pull out. “It’s a tough race, isn’t it? It’s something that pushes the limits of technology and people’s endurance. Unfortunately it wasn’t to be our year.” The fleet sailed upwind in winds of 25 knots on the first night with seas of 2-3 metres. “It’s really uncomfortable and tough on the body with confused big seas,” said Jo Clarke, crew member aboard cruiser Rum Bucket. “Lots of seasickness, but people are starting to recover.” Troubadour and Roaring Forty retired because of crew members suffering seasickness, while Moneypenny stopped racing after losing a life raft and failing to comply with requirement. The Bureau of Meteorology expects the wind to shift direction into Sunday and give the fleet some help down Tasmania’s east coast.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/25/my-big-night-out-white-stripes-gig-colleague-best-friend,My big night out: I went to a White Stripes gig with a colleague – and she became my best friend,2025-12-25T13:00:40.000Z,"On that brilliant night at Ally Pally 21 years ago, Laura and I decided to go to Detroit on holiday. Since then there have been countless adventures: road trips, dive bars, rock camps … icking-out time, January 2004, and Laura and I are sitting on the kerb waiting for a bus outside Alexandra Palace in north London. Not that we’re in a hurry to be anywhere else. We’re having the best time on our kerb, cheeks flushed from hard liquor and the exhilaration of the White Stripes show we’ve just seen. We’re busy communing with a fellow nocturnal creature, a woodlouse. It is one of those rare moments in my 20s when just about everything feels right. Laura and I had quietly become office allies over a few years, a bond initially forming around our mutual shy diligence in the face of not fully fitting in. We would conspiratorially skip downstairs to the canteen together most lunchtimes and temper any work worries by chatting shit, laughing hysterically and plotting small acts of rebellion. (Like the time we childishly made a “FUCK CHESS” sign and left it on the office chess club’s shelf, which for some reason felt necessary and hilarious. If you’re reading this, chess club, we’re very sorry.) The White Stripes coming to town was our pivotal moment. We’d never been so bold as to make plans together outside our professional sphere before, and we were still respectfully reserved with each other – first date vibes, as it were. Jack and Meg White were over from promoting their fourth album, Elephant. The support band, Blanche, came from Detroit, too, and their Motor City-greased gothic country enchanted us with its banjo, lap steel, gallows humour and irresistible showbiz mystique. Then came the mighty drama and conventions peculiar to the Stripes – virtuosity versus naivete, sonic sweetness versus wigging the fuck out – that held us in childlike wonder. This was the spirit in which our long friendship began in earnest, and in which on some level it has continued ever since. Laura and I had needed this release. We were both struggling in our own ways to shrug off the stifling “shoulds” of twentysomethingness: establish career, get on property ladder, breed, and all manner of more nuanced crummy expectations. Accompanying our post-show exhilaration was a bereftness at it being over. We were instantly pining for a way to prolong our escape from what we had come to call Tall Buildings (as in offices), the title of a song by US folk singer John Hartford. Ally Pally sits in a park on top of a hill with a panoramic view of the city below, and looking down over it, as its inhabitants switched off their lights and turned in for the night, made us even more wistful and defiant. A good night out can be a portal to a secret world where the daytime rules are suspended, revealing different possibilities and perspectives. We wished we could go and see what Detroit was like – the place that harboured these bands and so much other creativity, from Motown, the MC5 and the Stooges to Parliament, Funkadelic, Eminem and more. The bus, when it finally came, was brutally lit. As we chugged down the hill on our portal back to normality we resolved to do just that and, come May, we were there, sniffing the spring-fragranced trees, compulsively photographing graffiti, fire escapes and steam rising romantically from underground air vents, choking back tears while singing Stop in the Name of Love during a tour of Motown’s original home. We saw Blanche play and were invited backstage to meet the band and their friends … Jack and Meg. We felt like absolute idiots but they welcomed us awkward British strangers graciously. This was the start of a series of Homeric road trips, herculean nights out and epic friend-making sessions with Laura, in which one thing always led serendipitously to another. There have been dive bars, rock camps, tour buses, back-up singing sessions and late-night samosa street feasting. Together we have been charmed by an old bluesman and terrified by an Elvis fanatic in Mississippi, dipped our toes in Nashville’s Old Hickory Lake, taken a bonkers minibus ride with the Pixies in Chicago, pranced across Brooklyn Bridge in a blizzard in the early hours and generally gone looking for trouble, as Laura would say, which I love.",Amy Fleming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/23/the-10-best-global-albums-of-2025,The 10 best global albums of 2025,2025-12-23T07:00:52.000Z,"Lebanese singer-songwriter Yasmine Hamdan returns with mournful minimalism, Mohinder Kaur Bhamra’s 1982 album of Punjabi disco makes a comeback and Venezuelan-Guatemalan duo Titanic serve up ecstatic tracks A 40-minute suite of continuous, repetitive drumming might not sound like the most accessible music but south Asian percussionist and producer Sarathy Korwar’s latest album, There Is Beauty, There Already, turns this concept of insistent rhythm into strangely alluring work. Leading an ensemble of three drummers, Korwar develops a dense percussive language throughout the record’s 10 movements, channelling Steve Reich’s phasing motifs as well as Indian classical phrasing and anchoring each in the repetition of a continual, thrumming refrain. As the album continues, the refrain begins to emulate the hypnotic repetition of ceremonial rhythm, drawing us further into Korwar’s percussive world the longer we listen. After an eight-year break, Lebanese singer-songwriter Yasmine Hamdan returns with a mournful collection of songs expanding on the Arabic-language, dub-influenced sound that has made her a staple of the region’s indie music scene since the 1990s. Hamdan’s voice is quiet and ruminative, singing tender melodies over the bowing strings of Hon and the rumbling trip-hop groove of Vows, while on livelier tracks such as Shadia and Abyss, she employs a wavering, yearning vibrato over north African synth lines and rattling electronic percussion. The production is sparse and understated yet that minimalism provides the perfect setting for Hamdan’s emotive songwriting to shine through. Well worth the wait. Mexican producer Debit has a knack for eerie reinterpretations of historical sounds. In 2022’s The Long Count, she used samples of Mayan flutes to create a new electronically filtered musical language for the ancient instruments and on her latest release, Desaceleradas, she turns her attention to the 90s style of – a slowed, dubby take on the shuffling Latin American dance music genre. Debit slows this sound even further, processing its signature synths and syncopated beat through layers of sludge and static to produce a new, menacing groove. At turns ambient and discomfiting, Debit turns the joyous dancefloor sound of cumbia into a lasting, ghostly echo. Maximalism is the key term when it comes to the records of São Paulo producer Kaique Vieira, AKA DJ K. Coining his own genre of “ ” (witchcraft), Vieira layers a cacophony of sirens, explosive bass tones and screamed lyrics over the longstanding Brazilian dance style of baile funk to emulate the propulsive sound of favela street parties. On his second album, Radio Libertadora!, Vieira cranks up the intensity, adding everything from techno kick drums to the Islamic call to prayer into his mix, creating a particularly frenetic and punishingly loud 40-minute listening experience. Surrender to the noise and Vieira’s brash productions become strangely liberating. Sikh devotional singer Mohinder Kaur Bhamra’s 1982 album of disco music and Punjabi folk melodies is a rediscovered gem. Recorded by her son Kuljit, a music producer, Punjabi Disco’s 10 tracks deliver an unusually engaging combination of the metallic sound of synthesisers and drum machines with her melismatic Indian classical vocal technique. Electronic percussion mirrors the undulating tones of the tabla and synthesiser melody doubles the traditional sound of the harmonium on tracks such as Pyar Mainu Kar, while bossa nova rhythm comes to the fore on Soniya Mukh Tera and Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya channels a fast-paced walking disco bassline. It’s a dancefloor fusion delivered over a decade before the Asian Underground explosion. Mongolian singer Enji’s gentle fourth album, Sonor, expands on her jazz-influenced sound to deliver some of her most wide-ranging music to date. Moving away from her training in traditional Mongolian “long song” singing, the record’s 11 tracks veer from the soft Norah Jones melodics of downtempo number Ulbar to the German spoken-word lyrics and trilling guitar lines of Unadag Dugui and the sprightly, funk-inflected cover of 80s Mongolian pop hit Eejiinhee Hairaar. Featuring a full backing band, rather than her usual setup of guitar and bass, Sonor’s sound is still intimate, pulling the listener into the tender acoustics of her singular voice. Drawing on the 60s legacy of Turkish psychedelia established by groups such as Moğollar, German-Turkish singer Derya Yıldırım’s third record blends the metallic twang of the electrified saz with woozy Mellotron and classic soul melodies. It’s a 70s throwback sound anchored in Yıldırım’s powerful falsetto and influenced by producer Leon Michels’ analogue tape aesthetic. Yet, on Turkish standards such as the nursery rhyme Hop Bico and 60s song Ceylan, the group reaches lively new territory, developing slinking, downtempo grooves and soaring vocals that lend a new, off-kilter twist to the Turkish psych sound. Catholic requiem mass music, Czech harpsichord folksong and orchestral strings all come together on Colombian singer Lido Pimienta’s remarkable fourth album. Arranging music for the 60-piece Medellín Philharmonic Orchestra, Pimienta and producer Owen Pallett traverse everything from the Gregorian chants of opener Overturn (Obertura de la Luz Eterna) to the dramatic counterpoint melodies of Aún Te Quiero and syncopated dembow rhythms of the woodwind-heavy El Dembow del Tiempo. It’s Pimienta’s indefatigable voice that is the star, though, floating from yearning intimacy on Quiero Que Me Beses to the fierce full-throated harmonies of Busca la Luz, taking on her mighty symphonic backing with ease. Athenian rapper Negros Tou Moria has made his name over the past decade for coining the genre “ ” – a blend of the Greek working-class folk music of with trap. On Mavri Ellada, he supplants folk melodies for a more raw, hard-hitting sound, rolling through the sub-bass and baritone verses of Samatas to the Afrobeats groove of An Einai Dinaton, the bouzouki motifs of the title track and pumping dancefloor synths of PragmatiKotita. Armed with a dextrous flow, an open ear for unusual production and fierce lyrics on his country’s response to immigration, NTM establishes himself as a rap talent moving far beyond the Greek scene. Fearlessly experimental, Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti has ranked high in more than one of these global end-of-year lists, including for the enveloping introspection of 2021’s solo effort Será Que Ahora Podremos Entendernos? and 2023’s Vidrio, her freewheeling debut as Titanic with her multi-instrumentalist partner Hector Tosta. For their second Titanic release, Fratti and Tosta are delightfully unconstrained, playing through the metal blastbeats of Gotera, 80s stadium synth-pop of Lágrima del Sol, slinky funk of Escarbo Dimensiones and the post-rock moodiness of La Gallina Degollada. An arresting, consistently surprising record that truly sounds like nothing else.",Ammar Kalia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/tips,How to contact the Guardian securely,2025-06-02T10:48:05.000Z,"Some of the most important stories published by the Guardian have come
			from confidential tips. If you have something sensitive to
			share with us, here’s how to get in touch. Journalists work closely with readers like you to investigate stories
					in the public interest. While no communication system is foolproof we
					go to great lengths to protect your identity. If you’re ready 
					to share information with a journalist, you’re in the right place, 
					and we will treat you as a confidential journalistic source. We rely on people sharing tips in the public interest – and we’re
					grateful that you’re thinking about getting in touch. We’re unlikely to pursue a lead unless we think it may lead to a news
					story, and we can't act on information that is vague or speculative.
					Our job is to hold power to account, to reveal institutional or
					systemic failings and to report on topics that are genuinely
					newsworthy. Please be clear, detailed and specific about your tip, why
					you think it matters, and what evidence you have. Specifics are critical, such as names,
		locations and dates. Be concise 
		and focus on what you know, rather than what you think or suspect. . ‘Name’, the head of our 
		section, has received $150,000 in under-the-radar payments. Tell us how you know what you know,
		and how we might verify it. from the past two years and access to that show these were a quid pro quo for awarding 
		contracts to multinational company ‘Company name’. There are many ways to contact the Guardian securely. Review the
				following options to see which one is best for you. Share your story with a journalist. Securely & easily. Inside our news app. Our SecureDrop system is a great way to contact us and to send documents. However, it does require more technical preparation. SecureDrop allows you to safely send us messages and documents, and to follow
	up with us later if you wish. All we get is what you send us plus a codename
	that allows us to reply to you. SecureDrop records nothing else about you. To
	prevent interception at our end, we decrypt any material that you send us on 
	a system that is completely offline. On a computer that you are confident is not being monitored, install . Then go to theguardian.com/securedrop and follow the instructions there. When you first visit our SecureDrop site itself, you will be given a 
	passphrase before you can send anything. This phrase allows you to log back in 
	to view replies from us and to continue correspondence, if you so wish. 
	We do not always reply to messages and even when we do, responses can take several days. SecureDrop is quite a slow way to communicate, so after you have begun
	corresponding with a reporter they may suggest a more direct way to interact.
	You don’t have to agree to this, of course, but it can make things smoother
	under some circumstances. SecureDrop is an open source project managed by the End to end encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp provide good protection for the content of your messages, and are very easy to use. Signal is trusted by journalists, human rights activists and security experts
	worldwide, and is our recommended instant messaging app. WhatsApp, while not 
	quite as secure, also encrypts the content of communications and benefits from 
	being so ubiquitous that using it is unlikely (in itself) to raise suspicion 
	in most parts of the world. Other secure messenger apps tend to be less widely 
	used for communication between sources and our journalists. It’s not uncommon for conversations with journalists to shift to instant messenger
	apps once both sides have established some trust and have discussed the
	benefits and risks. But you or the journalist may decide not to use them. Decide whether you want to do this on your normal phone or on a less easily 
	traceable phone. After installing the app, make it as secure as possible: 
	if there are extra authentication options, activate them. And activate 
	disappearing messages so your conversations don’t sit around forever 
	on your device. If you’re worried about surveillance and you’ve not used the app before,
	consider using it for few innocuous purposes first, such as exchanging 
	messages with friends. That way, when you message us, your use of the app 
	doesn’t look out of the ordinary. Please don’t call or send ordinary text messages to those numbers. You won’t
	get a reply. Check our journalists’ profile pages for other contact details.
	Google their name and ‘the Guardian’ and you should find them. If you can’t
	find the right contact details for the journalist, you could message one of
	the above numbers and ask for your details to be passed on to the person you
	have in mind. Please note the recommendations earlier in this guide for what to say about 
	the information you wish to share. Use a tailor-made email account to make it less obvious that you are in contact with a journalist. If the information you wish to share with us isn’t extremely sensitive, 
	email is probably the easiest way to get in touch. Even so, you may 
	consider it worthwhile to put a bit of distance between your messages 
	to a journalist and the rest of your life. Plus, because journalists 
	receive so many emails, you should take extra care to make sure your 
	message doesn’t get lost in the noise. Email is an inherently insecure medium but you can do some things to make your 
	correspondence less likely to be intercepted. Don’t use your regular work or personal email address. Create a new email account 
	solely for corresponding with the Guardian. Do this on a computer that can't easily
	be linked back to you. When you sign up for a new email account, make sure the sign-up information 
	you provide doesn’t tie the account back to you. Never use the same password 
	for different accounts. Because it's so easy to send emails, journalists often receive a lot of spurious
	and irrelevant messages. So anything that doesn't get their attention quickly may 
	be overlooked. Read the advice further up in this guide about what makes a 
	good story tip. Information carried with an email message can reveal your IP address. 
	If you don’t want the location you send from to be traceable, connect to your 
	email service over the Tor network. or send from somewhere that doesn’t easily identify you. Remember to log out after sending the message. You may also wish to delete the 
	history of the correspondence from your browser or email software. Keep your computer secure. Some Guardian journalists publish PGP keys, allowing you to encrypt the content
	of email messages (but not the subject line or the fact that you are communicating with them).
	See Although telephone communication is far from secure, it can be a practical way to get a conversation started. Before you get in touch, find the name of the journalist you want to speak to,
	and decide in advance exactly how much you want to tell them about who you are
	and how they can get back to you. The journalist you want may not be available
	when you call, so you may have to leave a message. Be prepared for that. If you plan to share documents with us later, look at some of the other
	options in this guide before calling so you can tell the journalist how you’d
	prefer to do that. Consider whether or not it is safe to call us from your work or home phone, or
	from any mobile phone that is associated with you. If you buy a pay-as-you-go
	sim card to call us from a new number, think carefully about where and when
	you buy it, and how you pay for it. And remember that mobile phone calls
	disclose the handset ID as well as the sim card. Call us on one of these numbers: Post still has its uses, especially if you want to send us hard copies. If you’re not actually being followed it’s fairly unlikely that an envelope or
	small package will get intercepted. Stuff can go missing in the post, so consider how bad it would be to lose the
	material you’re planning to send us. Can you make copies? Think about whether or not you need to preserve your anonymity. Could the
	posting location give you up? How about the materials and packaging? If you’re
	very worried about the package being traced back to you, post it somewhere
	busy and make sure there is nothing memorable about your or the package’s
	appearance. Mail is scanned for dangerous compounds and objects. Don’t include anything
	that could cause problems with delivery. International mail needs a customs
	declaration, and registered mail requires you to provide sender details. Guardian software developers and journalists built the Secure Messaging
				tool in our app specifically to help people speak to our reporters as
				securely as possible. We recommend you use it if you live and work in a
				place where it is safe to use the Guardian news app. Are you looking for other ways to contact us? This page is about ways to contact Guardian journalists about issues that

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/25/how-to-sleep-well-away-from-home-good-night-rest,"Don’t fret the first night and nap if you need: how to sleep well, away from home",2025-12-25T19:00:48.000Z,"Disturbed sleep is very common as you adapt to a new environment but, with good sleep hygiene and some practical adjustments, you can quickly settle in s the working year draws to a close, many of us only have one hope for the season, and that’s a decent night’s sleep. While not every family visit or post-Christmas getaway is going to be a trip to Rancho Relaxo, a few things can help us catch holiday kip. Pre-departure apps can be useful, so can pillow mists and thermoregulation, but when it comes to maximising rest on the road, some say less is more. Our sleeping-while-travelling woes often begin before we leave home. Between frantic last-minute packing, finishing up work and early departures “you’re [likely] already a bit sleep deprived”, says Dr Sutapa Mukherjee, a respiratory and sleep physician and professor at Flinders University in Adelaide. Compound that with the logistics of actually getting to your final destination and even a relatively short travel time can put sleep hygiene off kilter. As we lay our heads down that first night, Dr Moira Junge, a health psychologist and the chief executive of the Health Foundation, says not to freak out if we toss and turn. “In sleep science there is a well known phenomenon called ‘the first night effect’. It’s really common – your senses are adjusting to different sounds and smells, the mattress pressure and level of darkness … but you will adapt, quickly.” Sleep scientists agree that developing a bedtime routine is good for sleep year round, and it can be particularly helpful to keep it up away from home. Mukherjee says most parents recognise the importance of sleep rituals for their children: bathing, a warm drink, some reading, but too often overlook how helpful they are for adults too. For Sharlene Loo, an 11-year veteran of Emirates’ lauded cabin crew who has visited more than 100 countries, that routine includes showering and skin care before lying in an L-shape with her feet in the air “for 10 to 20 minutes”. Loo says this helps with circulation and has become a daily habit and mental trigger for drowsiness, wherever she is. She also carries a small book of quotes for a screen-free wind down and uses a lavender pillow mist. “I don’t know if it’s a placebo but it works for me,” she says. Junge says that if she is driving she will usually take her own doona and pillow because “it adds another layer of familiarity”. While winding down is helpful, Junge says that waking well is just as important. She uses the acronym RISE UP, which looked at ways to combat sleep inertia. It stands for Resisting the snooze button, Increasing your physical activity, Showering, Exposing yourself to sunlight, playing Upbeat music and Phoning (or talking to) a friend. All of which the study found helps us shake off sluggishness if we’ve had a rough night. If you’re travelling through different timezones or into a different climate, Mukherjee says daylight is particularly important and “essential for resetting the body clock”. She suggests resisting the urge to crash on arrival and instead get into the daylight if the sun is still out, no matter how exhausted you are. Horrifyingly, Mukherjee says that it takes a full day to adjust for every hour of time difference, meaning it will take your body clock 11 days to adjust to the difference between Melbourne and London in December. Apps like Timeshifter can help by incrementally winding your body clock closer to that of your destination. The scientific consensus is that the optimum ambient temperature for sleep is around 17C to 19C. Mukherjee says that as the brain figures out it’s time for bed, a surge in melatonin naturally lowers our body temperature to help initiate and maintain sleep. But stuffy tents or drafty annexes can interrupt that process and, with it, our sleep. Sadly, not every holiday includes climate control, so Mukherjee suggests bringing a few sleepwear options to balance things out. When it comes to your pre-slumber ablutions she says it pays to adjust your temperature to the sleeping environment; if it’s going to be a hot one, have a tepid shower; if the room is freezing, have a nice warm one. “It’s all about bringing your temperature into the range where you can facilitate sleep.” Sleep tends to become more sensitive with age, Junge says. She now carries ear plugs and an eye mask because “a couple of bucks spent online, or even just pocketing the complimentary ones from the plane, can make a real difference”. Your screens should go to sleep at least an hour before you do but Mukherjee doesn’t see a problem with using audio to drift off – as long as there’s a sleep timer. She suggests about one hour, as our natural sleep cycles mean every 90 minutes or so we are more susceptible to being woken. If that music, podcast or rainstorm is still going, the chances are your sleep will suffer. One of the best things we can do to get the best rest possible while we are away from home is to take the pressure off, Junge says. “Don’t catastrophise! Don’t look at the clock too much and fret.” Junge sees many insomnia patients in her practice and studies people who have naturally good sleep hygiene. She says the best sleepers are people who barely think about it. “The bottom line is to not overthink sleep.” She reminds us that we don’t – or at least shouldn’t – count every calorie or worry about every glass of wine while on holiday. The same should go for sleep. After all, Junge says, “holidays are for relaxing” so leave the optimisation obsession at home, enjoy that extra serve of pasta, that drink. And if you’ve had a poor sleep, don’t start spiralling, “just have a nap, have a couple of coffees and try to enjoy the day”.",Doosie Morris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/nfl-playoff-race-bears-49ers-week-17-no-1-seed,NFL playoff race: Bears and 49ers clash with playoff bye week at stake,2025-12-26T14:53:30.000Z,"Week 17 delivers a decisive at Soldier Field as Chicago and San Francisco battle for positioning in a crowded NFC race for the No 1 seed and a precious first-round bye A throwdown for the NFC’s No 1 seed is the decorative iced penguin on a colossal Week 17 Christmas cake that started with , snowballs from there with a playoff preview between the Texans and Chargers on Saturday, and finishes with Bears v 49ers (discounting Monday’s morsel of Rams v Falcons). The race for the holy bye week has Chicago and San Francisco one game back from 12-3 Seattle, meaning the loser will have their hopes dashed at the final whistle. If the 49ers prevail, they can still clinch the No 1 seed with a win over the Seahawks in Week 18 owing to already holding the tie-breaker. If the Bears are victorious, they must beat the Lions next week and hope the Seahawks lose at least once to close the season. It is going down to the wire. The Bears’ defense is having an extraordinary year turning the ball over. The ball-hawk brothers Kevin Byard and Nahshon Wright are showing a preternatural ability to read a quarterback’s mind and, as such, Chicago lead the league in interceptions (21) and total turnovers (31). They need to keep the giveaways flowing to cut the legs from a San Francisco offense quietly becoming a juggernaut. The 49ers’ success has been largely built on Brock Purdy’s return at quarterback, which has laid on a five-game winning streak in which they average a chunky 34.2 points per game. Backup Mac Jones also had success, though not quite as much, with the 49ers scoring 22.8 points per game and posting a 5-3 record under his care. A major difference is Purdy’s unwavering aggression when pushing the ball downfield. These more dynamic, trigger-happy tendencies can lead to interceptions, as Carolina discovered when picking Purdy off three times in November, only to lose 20-9. What the Bears have that the Panthers did not is an offense capable of outscoring San Francisco if they can pull off a similar trick. Chicago need to be conservative, guard against the big play and patiently await a present from Purdy. San Francisco need to slow down Chicago’s impressive two-man running attack. D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, who have 1,728 rushing yards between them, form the best tandem in the outside of Buffalo’s unorthodox combination of James Cook and quarterback Josh Allen. Swift and Monangai’s old-school power running controls drives and keeps defenses honest as they efficiently chew up yardage from first whistle to last. The problem for the 49ers is that they have faced plenty of weak rushing attacks and have struggled against teams who run the ball well, such as the Rams. Los Angeles ran for 126 yards and two scores in their 42-26 thrashing of San Francisco in November. The solution may lie in the returns of linebacker Tatum Bethune and lineman Sam Okuayinonu from injury. Both are strong run defenders; both need to be ready to go toe-to-toe with a fierce offensive line and an even fiercer pair of backfield burners. The Bears will control the outcome if Swift and Monangai run riot. “I think there’s a mindset that you pay for a ticket, you say whatever the hell you want. I think there should be some sort of code of conduct. Obviously that was intentional and I think there was some celebration afterward on his part,” mused the cerebral quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The depth of thought is still outstripping the arm, then – no change there. Where change has come for Pittsburgh is finding a cause they can rally behind to bind them as a unit. Rodgers has revealed that the in-house narrative is that DK Metcalf has been treated unfairly, despite the receiver he could barely reach up to in the stands. Hardly a reflexive action to a vicious barb. But the bad man with the blue hair made him do it. Pittsburgh have their edge again. The entitled fan, and the rest of the NFL kingdom that want the black and gold to fail, are going to pay – even the home bodies chanting for Mike Tomlin to be fired in November. An edge missing on defense during early-season blundering has returned, enhancing an offense scoring in bunches for what feels like the first time in forever. Metcalf will make a triumphant return to save the Steelers on wild-card weekend, should they beat the Browns on Sunday or the Ravens next week, delivering a first playoff win in what also feels like forever. It is written. The wheels haven’t fallen off completely. The Packers are in the playoffs after the Lions limped out on Christmas Day. Job done. A window to winning the NFC North is still ajar, too, if the Bears lose out and the Packers win out. But after two successive defeats, Micah Parsons being ruled out for the season and quarterback Jordan Love’s fitness to face Baltimore in question, the omens don’t exactly scream Super Bowl contenders, which they very much were two weeks ago. The offense was exploding into life, leaning on Christian Watson’s deep threat, and Green Bay were leading the AFC-leading Broncos 23-14 early in the third quarter in Mile High. Defeat from a position of strength followed, as it did again at Soldier Field last week. The old enemy’s Caleb Williams delivered the most brutal of late daggers to extinguish what would have been a gritty victory against the odds. A chance missed to assume the playoff-boosting rallying cry – “nobody believes in us”. Instead, maybe the Packers themselves have lost faith now, too. And then there were two. A pair of 2-13 fall guys sharing respective nine-game doom slides. The Las Vegas Raiders and New York Giants sit in pole position for the top pick after Cam Ward’s Tennessee Titans whipped up on the fallen Kansas City Chiefs. And who might these bottom dwellers be facing this week? Each other. Yes, the bruised, battered and broken bowl comes crunching into focus, likely to settle the battle for good. Two jobbers enter; one leaves unsure whether to laugh or cry. The other lies crippled on the canvas, smiling through blackened teeth. Next year, the pain might just have been worth it. 1) Denver 13-3; 2) New England 12-3; 3) Jacksonville 11-4; 4) Pittsburgh 9-6; 5) LA Chargers 11-4; 6) Buffalo 11-4; 7) Houston 10-5.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/ashes-england-australia-boxing-day-test-excess,Boxing Day Test serves up too much of a good thing even in the season of excess,2025-12-27T08:50:11.000Z,"England chance their arm and emerge as winners over Australia in an Ashes half-match between two teams too hungover to care Was that fun? Was that … good? Certainly a lot happened in the Boxing Day Test. Those who paid their money saw action. But generally the cricketing public wants wickets and runs in vague equilibrium, not the odd run dribbling out of a hole in the dismissal vortex. Even the season of excess can have too much of a good thing. This wasn’t just overloading on Christmas dinner, it was saddling up for the festive meal at an all-you-can-eat sushi train with the conveyor belt turned up to five times normal speed. Without context, the setup sounds tremendous. An Ashes Test, a run chase, a tricky pitch, a huge crowd, . The line for tickets starts here. And yet, waiting for the final innings to begin at the MCG this year, the overwhelming sense was that whatever happened next didn’t matter at all. We were about to see a fourth innings take place the day after Boxing Day, for pity’s sake, just after lunch on the second day of the match. Such had been the extent of Australia’s subsidence that morning, and England’s the previous afternoon, and Australia’s before that. Thirty wickets in just over four sessions, one wicket remaining in the match for each of the 10 sessions still available. Only one of those sessions would be needed, whoever won. Everyone in the ground knew no England player would attempt to combat the pitch with guts and patience and skill. They would, in keeping with their preferred sport, tee off and hope for the best. It would not be a game of ability or nerve, but a cartoon cloud of dust and fists and boots from which Can you care about a scramble between teams too hungover to care themselves? One was . Do we blame Cricket Australia’s insistence on scheduling their showpieces, Boxing Day and the New Year Test, as the final two encounters when that so often makes them obsolete? But then, both teams played a . Do we blame the bounce there, the . Both hosted batting that can’t stand up to difficulty. Do we blame smartphone brains that can’t concentrate for longer than it takes to scroll past a Korean toddler singing the bridge of Golden? Until Perth, it had been over a century since a two-day Ashes match; since Perth it has been four weeks. Australia’s third innings in Melbourne was as bad as England’s in the west, a brainless scatter of shots assuming that a lively pitch would render sufficient whatever scant lead they scraped. Instead England’s openers chanced their arms, followed by a pinch-slogger at No 3, then the supplanted No 3 who was picked on the basis of looking good in the Warwickshire T20 side two seasons ago. The vice-captain smeared at mid-wicket while doing the splits, then air-practiced the shot doing even wider splits. The captain got out aiming for the Yarra River. England didn’t so much reach the target as crash a clown car into it, six wickets down. Is this Test cricket? Is it real? Is it worth anyone’s time? These questions aren’t just the dying yawp of traditionalism. They’re about something bigger than the players who happen to be in the middle right now. Those players paced out the final act in sunshine that made brilliant green the grass under their feet, in a show watched by more than 92,000 people, after This is where this half-match, this abortive contest, is just sad. Another sellout was listed for the third day. Huge crowds would have arrived impromptu for a fourth, even a fifth. People had built their week around this prospect, arranged their holidays, driving up to the city, booking in their time. Tourists were landing from England on 26 or 27 December, coming to tick an MCG Test off their bucket list, settling for later days given how readily Boxing Day tickets sellout. None of that will happen now. There will be talk about the money lost, the damage to Australia budgets, the independent vendors stranded with unsellable stock, the broadcasters complaining about bang for buck, all of which matter to varying extents depending how rich someone was to begin with. More than anything, though, there is the pace of life through this post-Christmas week, the period that is supposed to be set to the slow-ticking clock of Test cricket, while phones and watches of the normal ilk are briefly set aside. Waking up on 28 December with no cricket to switch on will be wrong, in some deeper way. England’s win could fairly be described as hollow, a shootout that sets them at 3-1 in a series lost, but had Australia taken four more wickets on this second afternoon, the gonging emptiness at the centre of this display would have rung as loud.",Geoff Lemon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/19/emily-in-paris-costume-designer-fashion-rome-season-5,No more French ‘fashion police’: Emily in Paris costume designer relishes move to Rome,2025-12-19T13:00:02.000Z,"Costume designer Marylin Fitoussi says Italy understands the show’s wardrobe is ‘about breaking rules and having fun’ The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

On Monday, Emmanuel Macron named the series’ creator, Darren Star (best known for Sex and The City), a knight of the legion of honour for boosting France’s cultural prominence and soft power through the show’s global success. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. It is a long way from the initial backlash, which partly centred on the brash wardrobe of Emily Cooper, the American in played by Lily Collins. Brightly coloured, print-heavy and over the top, the outre outfits were received as a personal affront by many Parisians, who even objected to her embrace of archetypal French chic. A beret caused particular consternation. As the Toulouse-born costume designer Marylin Fitoussi (the consulted on the first two seasons) told the Guardian this week: “I was really surprised by the Parisian audience, that they were offended by the beret – please!” But the backlash only spurred her and Collins on: “We didn’t just want to upset the French – we wanted to make them cry,” wrote Fitoussi in a new book, To Fitoussi, the Parisian resistance to Emily’s audacious American style was testament to the self-seriousness underlying the fabled French chic. “We are so boring and so posh sometimes. Nobody wants to smile because it looks stupid, nobody wants to be colourful because it’s tacky, no one wants to be a maximalist because they thought Coco Chanel said that you always need to take something off.” According to Fitoussi, tell a French woman she is overdressed and “she will jump out of the window”. Emily might have finally won over France, or at least its president and the first lady – Brigitte Macron made a cameo in season four last year and Emmanuel Macron even – but the new season, which landed on Netflix on Thursday, finds Emily settled in Rome, having had her head turned by Italy – and an Italian man – in last year’s finale. Fitoussi drew on classic cinema, including . Emily’s styling is more refined. She is seen in romantic 1950s silhouettes, such as tulip skirts and coordinating sets, along with exaggerated power suits and, more frequently, flat shoes. Her look is also more vivid in . Suddenly her wardrobe is full of polka dots – a nod to the on-screen wardrobes of Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale, Fitoussi said. “In several movies, they have a white dress with black polka dots or vice versa … I think it’s really something related to the DNA of Italy.” Iconic Italian brands such as Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and Moschino are not just featured in the wardrobe but are namechecked. Emily’s new beau, Marcello, is the heir to a family-owned cashmere company, clearly inspired by the actual brand owned by the designer Brunello Cucinelli. In episode two, Emily dons a Dolce tie shirt with an exaggerated rose print, “because she stayed in Italy for love, and she’s blooming”, Fitoussi said. For Fitoussi, the change of scene meant freedom from the French “fashion police”. In Italy, Fitoussi found a more receptive setting. “Italy understood since season one what I understood – that it was about breaking rules and having fun with fashion.” Emily has also had a haircut – a new bob prompted by Collins’s own decision to get the chop, subsequently approved for the character by Star. Fitoussi said it meant rethinking some of her planned outfits: “The proportions needed to be different, but for me it was much more modern, sexy, Parisian, powerful.” Fitoussi sought to put a youthful twist on old-world classics. For a dinner of , followed by dancing in the piazza, Emily wears a polka-dot denim bra top and short outfit (from the Los Angeles brand For Love & Lemons). For the season finale, set in Venice for fashion week, Fitoussi selected an off-white two-piece from the Danish label Stine Goya with giant spots. Fitoussi is looking forward to seeing how Emily’s Roman holiday wardrobe is received, namechecking the unforgiving fashion critics @ideservecouture and @dietprada. “They kill me all the time, with their mean comments, but they make me laugh a lot.” She said the polarising response to the show’s fashion was a mark of success. “She looks spectacular, or hideous; it needs to be punchy.” A sixth season of Emily in Paris has not yet been confirmed, but Fitoussi is hopeful she will get the chance to fully realise the character and her “vision of the French chic, with this spicy Cooper touch”. She has already sourced a skirt suit, designed by John Galliano for Dior in 1997: it would be “the first time in Paris she will be fully dressed in grey, with no print”, Fitoussi said. Maybe then the Parisians will finally be happy.",Elle Hunt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/27/how-community-action-confronting-racism-belfast,‘It restored my hope’: how community action is confronting racism in Belfast,2025-12-27T08:00:34.000Z,"An initiative linking people across race, class and faith offers an antidote to silence, hate and growing division , Maureen Hamblin knows that racism comes in many forms. “It’s not just the smashing in of shop windows,” she says. “It can be quiet, it can be silent.” Bystanders who hear racist remarks and remain mute, as if oblivious, amplify the hurt and leave victims feeling alone and isolated, a recurring experience that left Hamblin drained. “There was a time when I’d lost a lot of faith in white people, in white men.” and other towns in the past two years might have extinguished the last of that faith but instead Hamblin, who is originally from Kenya, stumbled upon hope. She joined an initiative called the , which connects strangers from different backgrounds – rich and poor, black and white, gay and straight – and tasks them with a subversive activity: getting to know each other. Each year a different circle, about a dozen strong, is formed and meets at monthly gatherings around to share stories and raise funds for organisations that promote tolerance and reconciliation. Hamblin related tales of racist abuse to her circle – its members reacted with shock – and listened to their own stories. Some had lives of privilege, others had experienced deprivation and exclusion. All recognised a commonality: Belfast was their home, and it should be welcoming. “It restored my hope. It humanised us all,” said Hamblin. The Circle of Change is the brainchild of , a charity based in the New Lodge area of north Belfast, an interface of Catholic and Protestant housing estates that endured murderous violence during the Troubles. Based at the , a former Presbyterian church, it offers clothing and support to vulnerable people and is a hub for artists and musicians. , 174 Trust will receive a grant to help it develop its work bridging community divisions and promoting positive local change to create an antidote to hate and distrust. The charity launched the first circle in 2018 with the goal of tackling polarisation, said Tim Magowan, the chief executive. “We try to create a microcosm of Belfast in each group. We want to challenge stereotypes.” Suzanne Lagan, who joined the first circle, found herself meeting fellow members at locations, such as an east Belfast food shelter, far removed from her middle class, Catholic upbringing. “A lot of places I’d never been to before. The more uncomfortable we felt the happier they [the organisers] were,” she laughs. Liza Wilkinson, 48, from a working-class Protestant background, viewed homelessness with new eyes after conversations with a young member who had lived on the streets to escape parents with addiction issues. “It made me realise how privileged I was to have a family network that I could rely on.” Wilkinson recalls her horror when another member, a mother from Africa, said that white youths routinely threw dog excrement at her children. “She wasn’t especially angry, her tone was matter-of-fact. It was heartbreaking.” The 2018 circle raised £50,000 for after-school care for black children – an achievement all the more poignant given the subsequent eruption of racial tensions. “There is a tradition here of ‘say nothing’,” said Magowan, referencing a Seamus Heaney line. “No one realised at that time just how racist we were. But when the riots came they were less of a surprise to us because of what we had heard.” When Hamblin joined the fifth circle in 2024 she despaired at the . Even in her local church, which was ostensibly progressive, prejudiced comments went unchallenged. “When people are quiet it’s like being double gaslighted.” She forged a bond with fellow members, especially Tony Macaulay, who shared an anecdote about challenging racist comments – at the risk of a thumping – in a chip shop. Hamblin, 37, loves to sing – “I sing for the joy of it, and to keep my sanity” – and Macaulay, 62, is the author of a celebrated memoir, Paperboy, so they teamed up to record literary readings and songs in TikTok vignettes titled Paperboy and Kenya Girl. For all its sectarian and racial faultlines, holds valuable lessons, said Macaulay, a peace activist. “We used to think that the Troubles would never end, that peace would never come. But it did come. Things can turn around.” Thousands of ordinary people contributed to the end of political violence with small, individual acts, said Magowan. “It gives me hope. I can’t do anything about what happens at international level but I can turn up here and do what I can at a personal level. I genuinely believe that’s where change come from.” The 2024 circle raised funds for , a scheme which teaches traditional Irish music to weekly classes evenly divided between foreigners – immigrants and refugees – and natives. “Music transcends language barriers and gives a sense of cohesion and belonging,” said Catherine Crean, 30, who runs the scheme. “One member told he me he’d never realised that Muslims could be good craic.” If the music classes are swimming against the tide – race hate incidents in Northern Ireland this year were the third highest on record – all the more reason to do them, says Crean. “That’s why they’re important.”",Rory Carroll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How? Plus, canal breaches and multiplying octopuses . I paraphrase, but not by much. A report from the Cornwall Wildlife Trust tells us that 13 times as many octopuses as usual – about 233,000, or nearly 2m legs’ worth – were caught in UK waters this year. Look, I don’t believe in signs but – these things are a sign. I don’t know precisely what of, but they’re a sign. When two freaky variants of two already freaky things happen, it’s a sign. And what’s freakier than sinkholes appearing or octopuses? Sinkholes are holes that . They are nowhere made manifest. They can happen anywhere, at any time. They just don’t care. You are safe never. The literal ground you are walking on could just give up on being ground and open up beneath you at any moment. This is no way to live. Holes need to be a thing that are only ever dug, laboriously, slowly, deliberately. And as for the other guys. I mean. No bones. Eight legs. Brains everywhere. . And now they are clearly mustering for an invasion. Stay alert in 2026, that’s all I’m saying. Stay alert. Here’s what I don’t understand. In the weeks leading up to , I have been doing twice as much work every day as I usually do so that I am free and clear for a bit over the actual proper Christmas bit and yet – no. I still have oodles to do before Boxing Day. How? I’m not complaining, please understand. I love to work and I love my job, two facts that I frequently send up prayer-type-things of thanks for before I bend back over my laptop to recommune therewith. I simply cannot fathom the maths. Twice as much for ages should eventually result in some kind of gap in the timetable, no? Deadlines met early, extra stuff filed, cached away, that should mean something, eventually, should it not? I eventually expressed some of my bafflement to a friend. “No,” she said. “What you have discovered is the essence of life as an adult. Time has no meaning. Existence is just one thing after another. You embrace that fact and move on. Or rather, you don’t. Because, as I say, this is life now.” I’m not sure this is exactly what Wizzard meant when they sang that they wished it could be Christmas every day. But we are where we are. A change is as good as a rest, they say, and today I am working on the train as my mother and I head to Devon to spend Christmas with my sister. The train left from Waterloo at 11.20am so my mother has been camping at the station for the last four days. I was in charge of buying the tickets so neither of us can be sure they’re right. We discuss my character flaws all the way there. I try to distinguish between my moral weaknesses and what I call “just being a different person from you”. But it’s a hard sell. Fortunately, one of my many defects is a willingness to partake of sustenance in public, because I was not raised by nuns who patrolled the streets of Preston looking for convent girls indulging in such venial sins and beating them to death outside Booths. And one of my mother’s few points of ignorance is that she doesn’t know that alcohol comes in vessels other than big green gin bottles. So I am downing cocktails in cans without her being any the wiser and Christmas is looking good. My sister managed the whole thing perfectly. Great food, great presents, great reminding me to put my son’s stocking out before I went to bed – top work all round. The rest of the family did well too. I’d bought my husband the correct edition of the Dorset Pevsner he’d asked for, so he disappeared with that all afternoon. We gave Mum all our odd socks in a big basket and she happily sorted those all afternoon while trying to remember the names of everyone in White Christmas and refusing her grandson’s pleas to let him look it up on Google. We ate, we napped, we listened for the first time ever to the king’s speech and decided his mother probably wouldn’t be too ashamed of him. We washed up, we went for a little walk with the dog, we napped again, we agreed we should play a board game rather than stare at our phones, we did not play a board game, we went to bed. Strong recommend, especially the sock thing. She’s been quiet all day. We are, as I say, in the Devon countryside this year, so the traditional trip round the sales that my sister and I customarily take was not possible, alas. I love the Boxing Day sale vibe. People are just so glad to be out, to be free instead of surrounded by loving relatives and weirdo uncles, to be looking round meaningless stuff again instead of having to feel gratitude and love and blessings and things. It’s got little to do with bargain hunting. In fact, if retailers had any sense, they would put their prices up. Everyone would pay the Boxing Day premium – the price of liberation.

The decision prompted widespread criticism from public figures including , leading the Jets to reconsider. “We realized there was an unfortunate misunderstanding regarding Ashley’s eligibility for the contest,” the team said in a statement. “In an effort to remedy the situation, we are allowing her to kick this Sunday for an opportunity to win the prize.” Castanio-Gervasi, 33, had earned her place in the contest after successfully making a 20-yard field goal at a Jets-sponsored tailgate event in October. She was originally identified by team staff earlier in the season after attempting kicks at a September home game, according to her account. The Jets said the initial disqualification stemmed from rules that prohibit current or recent coaches in soccer, football or rugby from participating in the promotion for insurance reasons. Castanio-Gervasi said she had disclosed both her college soccer background and her coaching role during the qualification process and was not made aware of any issue until days before the scheduled contest. “This is a bad look for an organization that should be looking for any positive PR,” Woody said on X. The $100,000 prize, sponsored by Hellmann’s, would be “life-changing”, Castanio-Gervasi said, noting that she planned to use any winnings toward buying a home and supporting cancer-related charities. She has said the opportunity carries particular meaning because she is attempting the kick in memory of her father, Frank, a devoted Jets fan who died of esophageal cancer in 2011. The family has continued attending games together in his honor and has raised tens of thousands of dollars for cancer education causes. After learning of the disqualification, Castanio-Gervasi said she planned to skip Sunday’s game, though the Jets had offered alternative compensation including team merchandise and a gift card. Following the team’s reversal, she and several family members now plan to attend the game at MetLife Stadium. The distance of the final kick has not been announced. Castanio-Gervasi is currently recovering from knee surgery on her non-kicking leg but said she intends to participate as scheduled. The team’s decision restores her chance to compete alongside three other finalists during half-time of Sunday’s home finale. The Jets enter the contest with a 3-12 record, good for dead last in the AFC East division.",Guardian sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may actually have been perfect TV ow could it be anything else? is the Guardian’s best television series of 2025. And you’d have to assume that we’re not the only ones who think so. In any available metric – story, theme, casting, performances, execution, impact – Adolescence has stood head and shoulders over everything else. So ubiquitous was Adolescence upon release that it would be easy to assume that everyone in the world has watched it. But just in case, a recap. Adolescence is the story of a terrible crime, and how its shock waves ripple out across a community. In episode one, 13-year-old Jamie Miller is arrested on suspicion of murdering a female classmate. In episode two, we follow a pair of police officers through a school, and learn that Jamie was radicalised online. The third is a two-hander between Jamie and his psychologist, in which Jamie’s anger rushes to the surface. The fourth returns to Jamie’s parents, as they question what more they could have done to stop this from happening. To say that it landed with a bang would be a terrible understatement. The issues that Adolescence dealt with – boys losing their way, and finding solace in the ugly world of the manosphere – were so utterly of the moment that they were discussed in parliament, with calls for it to be shown in British secondary schools. But themes alone don’t make a good show, and to concentrate solely on Adolescence’s message would be a disservice. Above all else, this was a human story about people who felt real. , who co-wrote Adolescence with Jack Thorne, as well as starring as Jamie’s father, was very clear that he didn’t want the motive to be too neat. The easiest thing in the world would have been to make Jamie the victim of abuse himself, but Graham and Thorne resisted this at every turn. Jamie’s parents are normal people. They love their son, but there’s an element of helplessness. They might see their son on his phone, but they don’t understand that he’s slipping out of their reach. Speaking of Graham, it is essentially a fact at this point that he’s the best actor we have. But to watch Adolescence is to see how much of that comes from his ability to surround himself with equally talented people. There isn’t a single duff performance in the entire show. (who plays the investigative officer) is basically the lead for half the series, picking through the case with a warm, weary humanity. Erin Doherty, the psychologist, offered a masterclass in her sole episode, a two-hander with Jamie. Christine Tremarco was an open wound as Jamie’s mother. And Faye Marsay, who was bizarrely overlooked in the praise heaped upon the show, played an extraordinarily vital role as Walters’s partner; she was, after all, the character who reminded us that this was a crime with a victim, and urged her name not to be lost in the chase for the perpetrator. And then there was Owen Cooper. The find of the year, maybe even the decade. As Jamie, a lot was asked of Cooper. He had to play young and vulnerable at the moment of arrest, then surgingly angry during his hour with Doherty. Not many performances can blow Graham off the screen, but that is exactly what Cooper did. And remember: this, with all its emotional and technical difficulties, was his first ever on screen performance. He came out of nowhere and stole the show. One funny little nugget to come out of Adolescence’s promotional cycle is the fact that when Cooper gained his next role – a retrospectively tiny part in Aimee Lou Wood’s Film Club – he struggled with the notion of editing. He had grown so used to long scenes without cuts that it took him a moment to adjust to traditional filming methods. Presumably now he has, though, and bigger things await. In February he plays young Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights. Even grander things are surely coming. As if this wasn’t enough, every episode of Adolescence was filmed in a single shot. The vaults that director Philip Barantini managed to take with his camera – winding through locations from vehicle to vehicle, leaping through windows and (in a shot that became an instant classic) literally taking off and flying through the sky – were truly unbelievable. Long takes have a tendency to become a little self-indulgent, a chance for directors to show off at the expense of everything else, but the genius of Barantini lay in how every one of his camera movements was in perfect service to the story. I’ve been doing this job for a long time now, and Adolescence may well be the only genuinely perfect show I’ve watched in that entire time. No matter where you look, or how hard you scrutinise it, you are met with nothing but wall-to-wall excellence. In 2025 there was Adolescence, then a huge gap, and then everything else. What a show this is.",Stuart Heritage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/dec/16/breast-cancer-mother-daughter,"First she got breast cancer. Then her daughter did, too",2025-12-16T17:00:10.000Z,"A breast cancer diagnosis is hard enough – what happens when a mother and daughter go through it at the same time? Genna Freed should have been in the mood to celebrate. On a cloudy November day in 2022, her mother, Julie Newman, was about to complete her final round of radiation, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in September. The whole family, a close-knit bunch, was gathering with balloons and signs. But Freed, then a few weeks shy of her 31st birthday, was carrying a secret. Spurred by her mother’s diagnosis, she had her first mammogram a couple days earlier, and it had turned up a suspicious spot. Now she needed a second, diagnostic mammogram, and likely a biopsy. She found herself walking a surreal sort of tightrope, caught between relief that her mother’s treatment was over and fear that she might soon be starting her own. “I went to the radiation center that morning, celebrated my mom having her last radiation treatment, had breakfast with everyone,” she recalls. “And then quietly went back to the medical campus, to the building across the street, to have my next set of scans and imagery done.” Two weeks later, on 9 December 2022, Freed learned she had an early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Telling her mom, she says, was excruciating: “I just remember being like, I don’t want to give her this news, but I also cannot keep this from her.” Just three months out from her own diagnosis, Newman, now 68, was shocked. “It was like a kick in the stomach,” she says. “I couldn’t believe it.” Newman pivoted from patient to caregiver, helping Freed’s husband with the couple’s two-year-old daughter while Freed recovered from her double mastectomy. Then Newman learned she needed a second lumpectomy, and Freed checked on her frequently; Newman set up a meal train for Freed from her recovery chair. It was a relentless rush of role-switching, says Freed, based on who was feeling better that day: “It felt like we were living through hell.” Back-to-back cancer diagnoses can have a profound psychological impact, unearthing sadness, helplessness and fear, says Dr Neha Goyal, a clinical psychologist at the University of California at San Francisco’s Helen Diller Family Comprehensive When someone – let alone two members of the same family – is navigating a cancer diagnosis, “there’s such a sense of loss of control”, she says. The people rallying around them may grapple with their own anxiety, grief and exhaustion. “It affected the whole family,” agrees Newman. “It was a very trying time.” Last January, three weeks into recovery from her own double mastectomy, Janet Parks, 62, found out that her 36-year-old daughter had breast cancer. “That was harder than my own diagnosis,” she says. “As a mother, your job is to protect your child at all costs, and I couldn’t do that.” of breast cancers occur in women with no family history, “we know that women who have breast cancer in their family have an elevated risk”, says Dr Nan Chen, a breast medical oncologist at the University of Chicago. In fact, having a first-degree relative like a mother, daughter or sister who develops breast cancer of breast cancers are totally hereditary in that they result directly from a mutated gene – like – passed down from parent to child, says Chen. About are considered “familial”, she says, meaning that while no specific gene mutation has been identified, there is still a family link. A woman with a BRCA mutation faces of developing breast cancer by age 70, compared with the of about 13%. Parks’s daughter, Alicia Schlossberg, inherited the BRCA-2 mutation from her mother; her chance of passing it down to her own daughters, aged 2 and 5, is . “I’m obviously very nervous that this is going to be their reality someday,” she says. Freed too is concerned about her daughter’s future. She inherited a BRCA-2 mutation from her father’s side, and wants to give her five-year-old daughter the choice to be tested for it when she’s older. The weight of the genetic gamble keeps her up at night, she says: “Am I borrowing all of this worry from tomorrow for nothing?” The median age of diagnosis is 62, but breast cancer rates in younger women are of new breast cancer cases in the United States occur in women under the age of 45. when their breast cancer has progressed to a later stage, and with more aggressive subtypes that require chemotherapy. But beyond the practical disparities, getting breast cancer in your 30s versus your 60s is “emotionally and psychosocially a completely different experience”, Chen says. Lindsey Baker was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in December 2020 at the age of 35. The week of Baker’s double mastectomy in 2021, her mother, Shelley Pozez, learned she had breast cancer, too. “It felt like a similar experience, but on a very different path,” says Baker. She was single, lived alone and dreaded the intricacies of dating after cancer treatment; her mother had a supportive long-term partner. Pozez, then 66, already had children; Baker – who inherited the BRCA-1 mutation, which also of ovarian cancer, from her father’s side – made the tough decision to remove her ovaries, surrendering her fertility and plunging prematurely into menopause. Pozez was retired at diagnosis; Baker, who was the chief operating officer of two non-profits, worked throughout treatment, bringing her laptop to all 16 rounds of chemo. Risk of recurrence is nuanced and depends on various factors. But Baker’s cancer, caught later than Pozez’s, was also growing more aggressively. “I think the chances of mine coming back are higher,” she says. “That still weighs on me differently.” Baker and Pozez diverged when it came to discussing what they were going through, too. While Baker drew solace from hearing other women’s experiences and sharing her own, her mom “was just a lot more private about it”, she says. Similarly, Freed is more candid about her cancer journey than her mother. After her mastectomy, she opted for a form of breast reconstruction called . “If somebody’s like: ‘Hey, what does a flat closure look like?’, I’m like: ‘Do you want me to take off my shirt?’” she says. “If my mom were in that boat, she’d be like: ‘You want me to do what now?’” Sylvia Morrison, 61, handled her breast cancer diagnosis in 2011 the way she’d seen her mother handle one several years before. “She didn’t really talk about it,” she says. “She showed no fear, no concern.” It was only when Morrison’s daughter, Monisha Parker, was diagnosed three years later at age 28 that she recognized that there might be another way. “I was a lot more open and willing to share my story,” says Parker, who started a blog, , about her experience as a young cancer patient. “I definitely think it’s a generational thing.” Morrison, whose cancer recurred in 2019, has regrets about her prior stoicism. “I’m still dealing with the mental part of breast cancer,” she says. “I’m over the physical part of it, but the mental part of it I didn’t deal with.” Watching her daughter’s response to cancer has encouraged Morrison to voice her emotions more often, in all aspects of life: “Monisha dealt with both sides of it, which I applaud her for, because she did something I didn’t do.” Morrison worried, would her cancer experience scare her daughter? “But I think it had the opposite effect,” she says. “Once she got over the initial shock, she was able to draw strength because I went through it.” In the spring of 2022, Allison Mertzman, now 40, was recovering from chemo and undergoing radiation for breast cancer, when she learned that her mother, Susan Pearlman, now 66, had the disease, too. “I was in such survival mode at that point that I was like: ‘Alright, hop on my boat, we’ve got to survive this together,’” she says. “We almost became teammates.” Already close, the two traded advice, words of encouragement and even post-mastectomy garments. Now that they’re both cancer-free, Pearlman says, she worries every time Mertzman goes in for a scan. “But I also know what that’s like. I feel the same thing,” she says. Weathering a life-changing illness alongside a loved one can often be “a source of even stronger connection”, says Goyal. At the same time, she cautions, it can also further any existing schism. “It doesn’t take away any underlying issues that may be present, and in fact can amplify them,” she says. “It depends on the dynamic.” For Freed, facing diagnosis, treatment and survivorship alongside her mother has yielded conflicting emotions. She’s grateful that her cancer was caught early, and that she and Newman are both still here. But she grieves all the losses: her breasts, time with her daughter and a sense of normalcy she’ll never entirely get back. “It’s two very diverging feelings,” she says. Parks too understands this dichotomy; after all, her diagnosis was devastating, but it also prompted her daughter to visit an oncologist and schedule an MRI, which detected cancer that likely wouldn’t have been seen on an ultrasound or mammogram until much later. “I see it as a blessing, honestly,” she says. For Schlossberg, it’s bittersweet that something monstrous had to happen to her mother for something miraculous to happen to her. “I hate that my mom had to go through this, and I hate that we even see her cancer that way,” she says. “But it really did save my life.” Holly Burns is a writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/26/rhea-seehorn-interview-making-pluribus,‘Bob Odenkirk called to check on me after he saw it’: Rhea Seehorn on the intensity of making hit show Pluribus,2025-12-26T06:00:03.000Z,"The star has hit the big time as a total grump in her new Apple TV drama – no mean feat, given how delightful she is. She talks Lego therapy, freaking out her Better Call Saul co-star and her frustration with the Guardian crossword hea Seehorn has had a hell of a year. For years she had garnered a reputation as a great underappreciated talent, but that has all changed now thanks to Pluribus. A series about one of the only people on Earth not to have their minds taken over by an alien virus, Pluribus is not only critically adored, but recently became Apple TV’s most-watched show. And Seehorn is front and centre through it all. However, today she has bigger things on her mind. “You gotta tell me how to crack the code,” she pleads before we’ve even said hello. “I’m an avid crossword puzzler, but I cannot beat the Guardian crossword. I cannot crack it, and I need to figure out what the problem is.” If you’ve seen Pluribus, in which she plays a grouch forced to save the world against her will, the delightfulness of Seehorn in person might come as a surprise. She is bright-eyed and alert, sitting forward in her seat and fully engaged. “I love making the show,” she says. “It has been the most challenging thing I’ve ever done, and the most rewarding. People are coming up to me and they want to talk about what the show is bringing up in them, and the thoughts it’s making them have. That’s been absolutely beyond satisfying.” But perhaps not surprising. Pluribus is the sort of show that deliberately takes its time unfolding the grand mystery at its core. Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, who finds herself unaffected by the alien virus that has affected the rest of the global population. While they all operate as a mass hive mind – existing peacefully, if creepily, in a state of unquestioning happiness – she finds herself tasked with restoring individuality to the world. To complicate matters further, everyone seems especially attuned to her behaviour … perhaps because millions of people die whenever she loses her temper. While creator Vince Gilligan has claimed that it’s partially autobiographical (it’s hard to see it as anything other than a reaction to his post-Breaking Bad celebrity, and all the sycophancy that goes with it) it’s also strangely universal. It’s the kind of high-concept show that has inspired a fervent obsession online of a level not seen since Lost. This obsession is something Seehorn respectfully prefers not to investigate. “I’m too much of a scaredy-cat to look online,” she reveals. “My friends tell me, even on social media, to never scroll down. I know eventually there’s going to be a comment that’s just like, ‘She is an ugly idiot who should never be on screen again,’ and then I’m just going to want to go do Lego sets for a week.” A bizarrely large chunk of the discourse online revolves around whether Carol should just give up and enjoy the simple pleasures of having her mind controlled. Seehorn doesn’t see the appeal. “When I think about happiness and joy, it always comes down to surprise,” she says. “Being surprised by others’ accomplishments. But in that world, there are no new books. There is no new art. There’s never going to be a belly laugh, because no one can surprise you. I’ll never get to do a crossword puzzle again, because I already know all the answers, because I made the crossword.” The story of how Seehorn got the Pluribus role has been told before, but it speaks volumes. Gilligan initially envisioned the lead as a man, but after seeing her in action on , where she played Kim Wexler, he swapped the character’s sex purely to carry on working with her. Seehorn has been working since the 1990s, but this is her first series lead. Those who know her understand the pressure this must put on her. “I watch Pluribus and my heart hurts for how long Rhea must have spent in physically and emotionally challenging states,” says . “When we did Saul, we lived together with Patrick Fabian, and we all helped each other through the show. I wonder how she is doing with decompressing.” Seehorn laughs when I mention this. “It’s so funny that he posed that question, because he called to check on me after he saw a couple of episodes,” she says. “He probably just wanted me to make fun of myself, because Bob has seen how my little squirrelly brain decompresses. There are art projects all over the house. There’s a Lego set, a jigsaw puzzle, embroidery, painting, hundreds of almost-finished crossword puzzles.” Does she miss living with co-stars? “People thought it was weird,” she replies. “Bob started it. He called Patrick and I after season one and was like, ‘Do you guys think we should just live together?’ And I was like, actually, yes. All of our partners and spouses know each other and are friends, and none of us are skeezy. And it can be mentally taxing to come home by yourself.” For Pluribus, which shoots in Albuquerque, she continued the tradition by moving in with Trish Almeida, the head of the show’s hair department, during production. “This one took longer to shoot, and it was challenging. A lot of explosions of anger, or suppression of anger in the moments when Carol is not allowed to show those feelings. A lot of time by myself, too. Sometimes even just seeing somebody for a cup of coffee can make your week.” The season one finale airs on Boxing Day and, without wanting to spoil anything, it ends on such a tantalising cliffhanger that the next batch of episodes cannot come fast enough. While they are definitely coming – Apple knows a good thing when it sees one – Seehorn can’t give a concrete date. “They’re in the writers’ room right now,” she says of Gilligan and his team. “But I don’t have a timeline of when they’ll complete that process.” At this point I make a small strangulated yelp of frustration, to which Seehorn responds with a sense of calming reason. “I don’t think anybody is sitting around going, ‘Let’s just make them wait,’” she says with a smile. “I know my writers. They take such great care. Plus, the scope of this show is huge. Think about the episodes where everybody disappears. We’re in a working city. There were cars driving by all the time. They all have to be erased.” But does she know what’s coming next for Carol? “I know the same as I did on Better Call Saul – one script at a time,” she says. “I never have any idea where it’s going. I haven’t a clue what happens next season. A couple of big things happen in the finale. And I gotta tell you, I haven’t a clue in the world where they’re going.”",Stuart Heritage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/26/manchester-united-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report,Patrick Dorgu volley powers Manchester United into fifth as Newcastle misfire,2025-12-26T22:04:57.000Z,"Boxing Day’s sole Premier League fixture tingled the senses and was graced by Patrick Dorgu’s finish that moved They could – and maybe should – have been limited to a draw because dominated the second period. The visitors’ problem was a lack of cutting edge. Towards the end Joelinton pulled the trigger with the goal begging but drilled only into Senne Lammens’ gloves. Joe Willock did the same with a cross. Then, Anthony Gordon spurned one more clear chance. So, missing Bruno Fernandes for only the fourth time of a five-year, 308-appearance United career, Ruben Amorim’s men finished the night happy, particularly as the captain was one of seven unavailable. Factor in how they ended with a backline containing the 20-year-olds, Leny Yoro and Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven (19), plus Tyrell Malacia, who last featured in January, and you understood why the head coach was pleased. “Yes, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six [were forced to] and we suffered together. If we always have this spirit we are going to win so many games. It is something we need to feel – that we can win games with spirit and togetherness,” said Amorim. Of Dorgu, he said: “Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his ability to drive with the ball. He did well.” For the first time, Amorim’s configuration featured a flat back four even when defending and stationed Dorgu as a right-winger, with Mason Mount chief orchestrator in attacking midfield. The former Chelsea man was a cocktail of industry and creation A gilded chance for Casemiro came when Mount’s corner dropped on to his head: unmarked, the Brazilian twitched his neck muscles and missed – poorly. Then Mount hassled Lewis Hall, pilfered possession, and passed to Dorgu. The Dane’s cross went to Benjamin Sesko whose pivot was followed by an aimless shot. Punch and counterpunch was the pattern. Sandro Tonali popped a corner in from Newcastle’s left, Bruno Guimarães nodded on, and in a near-post thicket Lammens squeezed the ball away. Eddie Howe’s unchanged XI were on top so Dorgu’s blistering strike was succour for United. Matheus Cunha’s devilry claimed a throw-in which Diogo Dalot lobbed into Newcastle’s area, Nick Woltemade’s header looped to Dorgu, and an instant left-foot volley flashed past Aaron Ramsdale in the visitors’ goal. One-nil to United and a feather in the Amorim cap for switching the effervescent Dorgu to attack. He and his teammates now hurtled at their visitors in a red blur. Balletic Dorgu feet bedazzled on the right and brought Mount in but his touch was laboured. Luke Shaw careered along the left and hoped to put Sesko in but failed. Cunha, too, tried to locate the Slovenia forward and was thwarted. A Dorgu break followed by an effort that Ramsdale saved, and the sight of Manuel Ugarte scheming were all part of the show Amorim’s men were putting on. They were breathless and exhilarating, direct and potent – in attack. Yet as the goals against column showed at kick-off – 30 conceded – defence is their issue. When Sesko dawdled and was robbed in his own half, instantly United were turned. The ball went to Jacob Murphy and a skimming ball over was missed by a stranded Lammens. United were missing Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo, and Fernandes, all injured, plus Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Amad Diallo, who are on Africa Cup of Nations duty. But at the interval Amorim’s team – captained by Lisandro Martínez, in his first start since February – walked off to applause, fine tidings for the head coach as his bench was crammed with five academy youngsters, including the Fletcher twins, Jack and Tyler, who were together in a matchday squad for the first time. Jack was brought on for Mount by Amorim who saw a slick Woltemade backheel find Jacob Ramsey. He manoeuvred into space then fell over, comically, in instalments. United’s bad habit of falling asleep directly after the break was again present. Newcastle, scenting blood, forced a medley of corners. At one, the ball bounced to Fabian Schär and his snapshot was deflected away by Dorgu. Amorim, seeing enough, brought Joshua Zirkzee on for Sesko, whose final act was to crash the ball off Ramsdale’s bar, as Yoro replaced Casemiro. None of this halted Newcastle’s flow. Hall skirted past Ugarte and also hit the bar. Schär wanted handball by Martínez but the video assistant referee ruled this was inadvertent, the defender’s effort hitting him on the underarm. Newcastle have won away from home only once in the league this season, 4-1 against Everton. Howe said: “You could make an argument we should have got something today but ultimately we haven’t.” He needs to remedy this – fast.",Jamie Jackson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/26/havertz-near-to-arsenal-return-with-arteta-hoping-for-different-dimension-in-attack,Havertz near to Arsenal return with Arteta hoping for ‘different dimension’ in attack,2025-12-26T12:00:10.000Z,"Forward underwent knee surgery in August Arteta: ‘It will be a matter of days, not weeks’ Mikel Arteta hopes Kai Havertz is ready to return from a long-term knee injury and has predicted the German will bring “a different dimension” to Arsenal’s attack. Havertz has been sidelined since undergoing knee surgery in August and had been expected back at the start of December before a setback in his rehabilitation. The 26-year-old was Arsenal’s top scorer in the Premier League last season with nine goals despite missing several months with a hamstring issue. He was pictured training this week and Arteta revealed Havertz had been “quite close” to being considered for the Carabao Cup quarter-final “I think it will be a matter of days, not weeks,” the manager said. “Let’s see in the next step how he responds to that. But he’s a player that we miss a lot, a player that brings the team into a different dimension. So I’m really happy to have him back very soon.” Saturday’s meeting with Brighton may come too early for Havertz, who will compete when fit with the £64m signing Viktor Gyökeres and Gabriel Jesus – who started his first game for almost a year against Palace – to lead the line. Gabriel Martinelli is a doubt with a knee injury and Arteta has more problems at the back after revealing Piero Hincapié picked up an unspecified injury in the win over Everton. Riccardo Calafiori is expected to continue alongside William Saliba in central defence – the eighth pairing have used this season – but it is hoped that Gabriel Magalhães could be back in contention in the new year. “He hasn’t trained yet, so he’s still doing his rehab,” Arteta said. “But, hopefully, as quick as possible because we know the situation that we have in the back.” Injuries undermined Arsenal’s title challenge last season but this time they have at least avoided racking up red cards. As well as being top of the Premier League, Arteta’s side lead the fair play standings with 22 bookings from 17 games and no dismissals – a vast improvement after six sendings-off last season. The first of those came in the home game against Brighton in August 2024 when Declan Rice was shown a controversial second yellow card for kicking the ball away. “I remember very well, I was very hacked off in the manner that we played with 10 men,” said Arteta. “Hopefully it’s going to be very different next time.”",Ed Aarons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/25/books-to-look-out-for-in-2026-nonfiction,Books to look out for in 2026 – nonfiction,2025-12-25T07:00:33.000Z,"Memoirs from Liza Minnelli and Lena Dunham, essays by David Sedaris and Alan Bennett’s diaries are among the highlights of the year ahead Over the past year we’ve been spoiled for memoirs from high-wattage stars – Cher, Patti Smith and Anthony Hopkins among them. But 2026 begins with a very different true story, from someone who never chose the spotlight, but now wants some good to come of her appalling experiences. After the trial that resulted in her husband and 50 others being convicted of rape or sexual assault, Gisèle Pelicot’s aim is to nurture “strength and courage” in other survivors. In (Bodley Head, February) she insists that “shame has to change sides”. Another trial – of the men accused of carrying out the Bataclan massacre – was the subject of Emmanuel Carrère’s most recent book, V13. For his next, (Fern, September), the French master of autofiction turns his unsparing lens back on himself, focusing on his relationship with his mother Hélène, and using it to weave a complex personal history of France, Russia and Ukraine. Family also comes under the microscope in (Sceptre, May) by Siri Hustvedt, a memoir of her final years with husband Paul Auster, who died of cancer in 2024. Hollywood isn’t totally out of the picture, though: (Seven Dials, May), Sylvester Stallone’s first autobiography, follows the star from homelessness in early 70s New York to Rocky’s triumph at the Oscars later that decade. Does achieving your creative dreams come at a price, though? Lena Dunham suggests as much in (4th Estate, April), billed as a typically frank memoir of how how her dramatic early success gave way to debilitating chronic illness. Frankness of a different kind is promised in (Bloomsbury, September), actor Gillian Anderson’s follow-up to her bestselling 2024 anthology of women’s sexual fantasies, Want. Likely to be somewhat less racy – though just as acutely observed – Alan Bennett’s diaries (Faber, March) span the period 2016-2024, taking in such momentous events as Brexit and the death of the Queen, as well as a plague of molehills in Bennett’s garden. After relinquishing his mantle as host of In Our Time, Bennett’s near contemporary Melvyn Bragg travels back to (Sceptre, February), namely his three years at Oxford in the late 1950s. Curious Incident author Mark Haddon also looks to the past, this time to the 60s and 70s, in his quirkily illustrated coming of age memoir, (Chatto & Windus, February). David Sedaris’s latest collection of essays (Abacus, July) includes such dispatches from his bucolic existence in Sussex as “I know you can’t hold animals to human standards … That said, rams are assholes.” We’ll have to see whether similarly intemperate outbursts are detailed in a major new biography of (Bloomsbury, February), for which author James Macintyre was allowed “unique” access to the former prime minister’s personal archives. For his part, ex-home secretary and chancellor Sajid Javid will avoid dishing the dirt on recent governments, focusing instead on his childhood in (Abacus, February). And following her departure from the cabinet in September, Angela Rayner has decided to write a memoir – as yet (Bodley Head) – reflecting on her tough upbringing and path into politics, set to be released in the second half of the year. Away from life writing, North American heavyweights tackle the big ideas: in (Allen Lane, February) by Michael Pollan, the author of How to Change Your Mind considers the small matter of consciousness – what is it, and how do you measure it? With (Granta, March), Rebecca Solnit reminds us how revolutionary the past 60 years have been in terms of social change. She views the current turn towards authoritarianism as setback, rather than defeat. Doppelganger author Naomi Klein teams up with documentary maker Astra Taylor to describe (Allen Lane, September), the “man-made Armageddon complex” built by religious fundamentalists, tech barons and nationalists that threatens democracy. Jared Diamond, the historian best known for Guns, Germs and Steel, returns with his first book in six years, (Allen Lane, September), on the influence of charismatic individuals in politics, business, sport and religion. And Patrick Radden Keefe, whose Empire of Pain exposed the billionaire dynasty behind the opioid epidemic, investigates the mysterious death of a young man in Following the extraordinary success of Adolescence, the Netflix show that showed the aftermath of a misogynistic killing, teenage masculinity remains front and centre. One of its stars, Stephen Graham, has teamed up with psychologist Orly Klein to compile (Bloomsbury, October), a collection of fathers’ reflections on “what it means to be man”, including one from the actor himself. And in Jon Ronson embarks on a journey to discover exactly what led his son Joel to attend a mysterious event at a multi-millionaire’s mansion in New England, in the process uncovering “a world of unmoored men on a desperate search for purpose”. I was going to say Liza Minnelli’s memoir may provide some light relief, but the Cabaret star’s life has contained at least as much tragedy and heartache as it has spotlights and sequins. Still, you’ll be able to read about both in , “as told to” her friend and singer Michael Feinstein – though if you’re expecting a studiedly neutral account, you might have to wait a bit longer: the emphasis is on “dispelling tabloid myths and setting the record straight”. A lower-key but no less interesting musical star, David Byrne, brings us his first proper book since 2012’s How Music Works, (Canongate, October).

Egypt have six points from their opening two games and cannot finish outside of the top two in the group. South Africa have three points from their two games. Salah won the penalty when he was clipped in the face by South Africa defender Khuliso Mudau as they tussled for the ball, and stepped up to easily convert for his second goal of the tournament. Egypt lost right-back Mohamed Hany to a red card for an ugly stamp at the end of the first half and faced wave after wave of South African attacks in the second period, as the latter were denied a penalty of their own for handball following a lengthy video assistant referee check. Lassine Sinayoko’s second-half penalty rescued a 1-1 draw for from booking their spot in the last 16 in Rabat. Morocco hit the front thanks to Brahim Díaz’s spot-kick deep into added time in the first half. Díaz earned the penalty with a fine bit of individual work before Nathan Gassama handled in the area but Mali got their own penalty after a video assistant referee check after 64 minutes when Sinayoko was upended and he made no mistake. Morocco sit top of Group A on four points, with Mali and each earned their first point at the tournament following a 1-1 draw but the result leaves both facing early elimination. They both lost their opening Group B clashes and are now left with difficult assignments in their last matches next week which they will effectively need to win if they are to progress. Angola went ahead in the 24th minute when To Carneiro’s chipped pass fell perfectly for striker Gelson Dala, who ran on to it and squeezed the ball in at the near post as Zimbabwe’s defence proved too slow in closing down. There was a lengthy delay soon after as Angola goalkeeper Hugo Marques suffered a cut above his eye after a clash of heads with Zimbabwe’s Divine Lunga. He was bandaged up and continued but, in the sixth minute of stoppage time at the end of the first, he was beaten as Zimbabwe’s veteran striker Knowledge Musona equalised. Angola now go up against the group’s top seeds Egypt, in Agadir on Monday, while Zimbabwe take on neighbours South Africa in Marrakech at the same time. ’s hopes of making the knockout stages suffered a setback after being held to a goalless draw by in their opening Group A fixture, thought they had taken the lead in the 19th minute through Myziane Maolida after he was played in by Rafiki Saïd, but the goal was ruled out by the VAR for a foul in the buildup. Zambia struggled to break down their opponents with the captain Fashion Sakala sending an angled shot into the side netting. Comoros went close to snatching a late winner with 10 minutes left when Youssouf M’Changama floated in a deep cross from the left which Zambia’s goalkeeper Willard Mwanza failed to collect, but Faïz Selamani sent his close-range header over.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which ones did we play so much our thumbs hurt? And which one saved my soul? Let the ceremony begin … o, how was 2025 for your household? Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth? I have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most. Without further ado: On her phone, meanwhile, she’s been playing Cityscapes and “trying to find decent healthcare”. “I don’t play games on my phone.” He was offended that I even asked him that question. I respect that. She is trying to get into theatre school, but when she wasn’t singing, she was playing Resident Evil. She also went on in great detail about her achievements on The Sims, where the Shark has a thriving utopia with infinitely better healthcare than her big sister has in real life. : Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time She started the year at 60% completion and ended it at 82%. It’s a marathon not a sprint for her. On her phone: something called Woodle, where you have to unscrew pins. Any time I see my 21-year-old son playing Minecraft, I set about him like a cross between Steve Martin with that guy in the pub in Roxanne, and Joe Pesci with Spider in Goodfellas. When he complains, I reply that I am doing this to toughen him up so he can be a man and play games for grownups. It’s a very Scottish father/son relationship. Eldest daughter on Just Dance 2024 There was no contest for this one. She is a machine. Even better than I was at the Cure’s Lovecats on Dancing Stage MegaMix in my prime. Nothing came close to the hours I spent on this insanely well-crafted deck building wizard’s poker, with its constantly evolving range of cards and game variations. The worst thing about games that constantly evolve their range of cards and variations is you wake up one day and realise it is all just an attempt to suck you into fomo-fuelled microtransactions. So love turned to hate halfway through the year and it went into the bin. Glorious reinvention of a classic. Immersive atmosphere from the off. I wish I could eviscerate my demons so effectively in real life. I refuse to rush this beautiful, unique game and I just didn’t have the time or headspace to give it what it deserved earlier this year. My mother is staying with us over Christmas and the New Year, so I will be playing this in the wee small hours after I have prosecco’d her into oblivion. I know Balatro was 2024’s breakout game, but I was late to it. And it is remarkable. It just gets every single thing right. Crazy Poker is a wonderful concept, but the powers behind the different joker cards are so imaginative it has become a game I literally would play any time of the day or night. Throw in the wittiness of the card design, and this is an absolute high-water mark of gaming. I dream of being stuck in a broken-down lift for hours so I have nothing to do but play it. I experienced a minor pile-on when I wrote about how the Paintress boss battle bug in Clair Obscur ruined the whole game for me, but it’s still a gargantuan gaming achievement in terms of art, sound, acting, battle gameplay and ambition – which I appreciated even more after slogging through Outer Worlds 2. So thank you to the reader who took the time to email me personally, through my website, to say that my Outer Worlds 2 review was “bitter, confused resentment because YOU DON’T GET THE GAME OLD MAN and your son is an idiot as well sorry to inform you.” I present that in the exact way it was written, because I appreciate the effort, and he is obviously an excellent judge of character where my son is concerned. Sure. Give me a bastard-hard Metroidvania-esque thing and don’t tell me what I am supposed to be doing, except “explore”. Great fun. I get that it looks ace and is perfection if you are into this kind of thing, but I cannot think of a gaming experience I want less of in my mid-fifties. I was around back when all games were like this, and I’ve had enough. It was fine when I was a kid, but so was polyester. , and Outer Worlds 2 costing £70. Both morally indefensible and repugnant. : Clair Obscur, Despelote and Bananza would all sound good bellowed from the doorstep at tea time. : Right thumb joint. Seriously.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/bad-for-business-cricket-australia-facing-5m-loss-after-two-day-test-at-mcg,‘Bad for business’: Cricket Australia facing $10m loss after two-day Test at MCG,2025-12-27T10:59:28.000Z,"Packed MCG finished with three full days to spare Ground curator Matthew Page at centre of the storm England’s two-day win in the Boxing Day Test is set to deliver a huge financial hit to Australian cricket that could reach a reported $10m (£5m). That is the expected loss in revenue after the match on an excessively bowler-friendly surface at a packed MCG finished with three full days to spare. A sell-out crowd of more than 90,000 was due for day three, including a travelling English contingent of up to 20,000, and the lack of play on Sunday will lead to an avalanche of refunds as well as lost sales in merchandise, food and drinks. A similar situation played out when Australia won in two days in Perth, where losses ran to an expected $3m (£1.5m). Ground curator Matthew Page finds himself at the centre of the storm after turning in a surface showing a lavish 10mm of live grass that made batting a perilous endeavour. Todd Greenberg, Cricket Australia’s chief executive, was desperate to avoid such a scenario, telling SEN Radio before play on the second morning: “A simple phrase I’d use is – short Tests are bad for business. I can’t be much more blunt than that. “Historically we have taken a hands-off approach in all of our wicket preparation... but it’s hard not to get more involved when you see the impact on the sport, particularly commercially.” Australia’s acting captain, Steve Smith, did not seem too concerned by his side’s rapid win in the first Test but was less content after coming out on the losing side. “The finances aren’t great and I think it was a sell-out tomorrow,” he said. “We saw 36 wickets in two days and that indicates it was a pretty tricky wicket. It probably offered a little bit too much. A lot of the Tests have been played in fast forward and this one was over in two day, not ideal. It would be good if it was a little bit longer and we were able to entertain the fans some more but it wasn’t to be.” The former England captain Nasser Hussain said the pitch turned the match into a farce. “I don’t think it’s acceptable not having spin at all and having so much movement in the surface,” he told Sky Sports. “It was farcical at times and when things are farcical it is thrilling to watch, but there are traditionalists still in Test match cricket.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After more than a decade apart, they’re back together and their sexual connection is stronger than ever Ally notices the occasional looks people give us, and her response is to ask me to give her a kiss in front of them When Ally and I first met, she was 25 and fresh out of uni, and I was 47 and recently separated from my wife. I walked into work every day and saw this beautiful young woman with long dark hair and the most fantastic smile. Eventually I did the cheesy thing and wrote her a note telling her how I felt. I didn’t expect to hear from her. I thought she’d be thinking: what’s this old guy doing? But it was obvious that we had a lot in common artistically, culturally and intellectually. We started having a sexual relationship really quickly. It wasn’t expected, but it happened, and it was amazing. After three years, we broke up because of stress I was experiencing around work. It was the worst decision of my life. I didn’t hear from her for 13 years. This summer we ended up meeting purely by chance at a cafe. I felt a sense of wonderment that I had found her again. It’s only since our relationship began again that I started to think about the age difference and the implications. I feel older, so I’m thinking about it more now than I did 16 years ago. There are of course a lot of very healthy, vibrant and fit old people. Many who are still having loads of sex, and I think, good on you. But the age gap does concern me, and I think about this more than she does. Ally notices the occasional looks people give us on the train, and her response is to ask me to give her a kiss in front of them. She doesn’t care. Since getting back together we’ve been more sexually active because we’re better at communicating. It’s not unusual for us to go to bed at nine; I’ll fall straight asleep then wake up a couple of hours later, we’ll have sex, go to sleep, wake up again and have some more sex. That can happen throughout the night. Despite the age gap, we just understand each other and things work so well. I have better sex than with her than I’ve ever had with anyone. It is of a totally different order of magnitude. If you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below. It is very important that both sexual partners are happy to participate. Please include your country's area code if outside of the UK. Please include your country's area code if outside of the UK. When we met 16 years ago we were at different stages in our lives. So when we began dating I thought we were just enjoying each other’s company. We went out and we had fun. It wasn’t until afterwards – years after we’d split up – that I realised I had been in love with him. I find it intensely irritating when other people make a big deal about our age difference. It immediately makes me bristle, because age really doesn’t matter. I do believe it is just a number. And these judgments come from other people’s prejudices. We’re intensely attracted to each other, we love and care for each other, so the age gap has never had an effect on me and I’ve never cared about it – although Jason is more conscious of it. But I’ve always said that the problem isn’t us, it’s everyone around us. I was 25 when we first met, and I am not any more. My body has changed, and before we reconnected this summer I hadn’t undressed in front of anyone for a long time. I was terrified because Jason is someone who knows exactly what I looked like in my 20s. I worried whether he would still find me attractive? Would he be disappointed? That was a concern at the beginning, but it turned out to not be a problem at all. I’ve always been attracted to him – even after 13 years without contact – that was instant and it has not changed or diminished in any way. And I’m made to feel attractive too; he tells me every day, several times. That means a lot. I just have to look at him and I’m ready to go. That has not been my experience in other relationships. We just understand each other and each other’s bodies so well. We have a deeper sexual connection now that we’re older and our bodies are changing. It even takes longer for me to climax now, but that just means more time to enjoy it.",Naomi Larsson Piñeda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/24/sali-hughes-beauty-milky-toners,Sali Hughes on beauty: the new crop of milky toners are a game-changer,2025-12-24T10:00:08.000Z,"These gentle, hydrating toners impart the glassy look popularised by Korean skincare – and I can’t do without them The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. wouldn’t say it was rare that the beauty industry invents a whole new product category, but my own willingness to adopt another step certainly is. Ten years ago, I’d have told you not to bother with toner unless you particularly enjoyed using it, which is as good a reason as any in a world on fire. And yet over the past couple of years, the new “milky toners” have, to me at least, become so functional as to be indispensable. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. These are cloudy fluids, thicker than a toner but thinner than a moisturiser, usually containing gentle, universally skin-pleasing ingredients like glycerine, ceramides and peptides. The idea is to apply straight after cleansing, to slightly damp skin, before the serum step, to increase hydration and comfort, and impart that glassy look popularised by Korean skincare (from where, it can fairly be said, milky toners first came). In practice, they do all of this and more. Milky toners work very well at giving drier, wintery skins an additional opportunity to drink up, and can even be used by very oily skins in place of day cream. In either case, I recommend Rhode’s wildly popular , from £20, a milky toner that I was almost determined not to like but is probably my most used. As well as providing instant comfort, ungreasy moisture and an aesthetically pleasing dewiness to my makeup, it has the bonus benefit of being the perfect mixing medium for tanning drops (trust me – I’ve now converted several beauty editors to this method) and to sheer-out heavy foundation. For nighttime, I step things up a gear to indulge my skin barrier function and buffer my somewhat feisty prescription retinoid. My weapons of choice are Dr Loretta’s very elegantly textured , £50, made by one of the most no-nonsense and wise US dermatologists I’ve ever met, and Dr Jart’s thicker , £35, a thicker, buttermilk-textured lotion that seemingly aggravates no one. If your schedule and priorities won’t tolerate another skincare step, you can still feel the benefits on an ad hoc basis by opting for a mist that can be used quickly under or over makeup. For example, when I’m reluctantly about to join a Zoom call mid-afternoon, I now instinctively reach for Dr Althea’s super – and very nicely priced – , a milky toner that instantly re-plumps and makes my skin look lively, not as though it is limping its way to bedtime.",Sali Hughes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/26/perry-bamonte-guitarist-the-cure-dies,"Perry Bamonte, guitarist and keyboardist for the Cure, dies aged 65",2025-12-26T21:06:25.000Z,"Starting as a roadie and guitar tech, Bamonte joined the band in 1990 after its breakthrough album Disintegration Perry Bamonte, longtime guitarist and keyboard player for the Cure, has died aged 65. The musician, known affectionately as Teddy, passed away after a short illness over Christmas, the band announced on their website. The band described the musician as “quiet, intensive, intuitive, constant and hugely creative”, calling him a “vital part of the Cure story”. “Looking after the band from 1984 through 1989, he became a full member of the Cure in 1990, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard on the Wish (1992), Wild Mood Swings (1996), Bloodflowers (2000), Acoustic Hits (2001), and the Cure (2004) albums,” the band wrote on their website. Formed in 1976 by lead singer Robert Smith and drummer Lol Tolhurst, the Cure are known for their influence on goth, post-punk and indie music. Bamonte, who was due to play on the Cure’s UK and European tour in 2026, first joined the band as part of their road crew in 1984 through his brother, Daryl, who was the band’s tour manager at the time. He became a full-time member of the band after the departure of keyboardist Roger O’Donnell in 1990. Over the next 14 years, he performed more than 400 shows, playing on some of the band’s best-known tracks, such as Friday I’m in Love, High and A Letter to Elise. Bamonte, who was born in September 1960 in London, left the Cure in 2005 after the band was reconfigured as a trio. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside the Cure. “He rejoined the Cure in 2022, playing another 90 shows, some of the best in the band’s history, culminating with the in London on 1 November 2024,” the band wrote on their website, adding: “Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.” Bamonte was also the bass player in supergroup Love Amongst Ruin, alongside former Placebo drummer Steve Hewitt and Julian Cope collaborator Donald Ross Skinner. The group have released two studio albums, their self-titled 2010 debut, and Lose Your Way, released in 2015. The musician was also interested in fly fishing and built a career as an illustrator, contributing to the magazine Fly Culture. In a tribute on Instagram, Bamonte’s former bandmate, drummer Lol Tolhurst, wrote: “So sad to hear about Perry Bamonte passing.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/englands-mcg-triumph-is-a-genuine-coup-and-a-picture-of-what-might-have-been,England’s MCG triumph is a genuine coup – and a picture of what might have been,2025-12-27T11:00:38.000Z,"A properly prepped, balanced and weaponised team finally had the chops to expose Australia’s weaknesses Na-na na-na na-na na na na, Duckett’s on the piss. On the piss. Duckett’s on the piss. Don’t take me home, please don’t take me home. And while we’re here, stand up, stand up, please do stand up if you love a two-day Test on a pitch as green and ridged as an under-ripe roasting potato. For an hour in mid-afternoon on day two at the MCG England’s top order finally did the thing. The clocks stopped. Dogs miaowed. Birds flew backwards across the sky. And Test cricket turned into darts. This was probably always coming in some form. The universe tends toward entropy. In England all things are, in the end, shirtless men singing Sweet Caroline. As England’s openers set off in pursuit of 175 to win this fourth Test at the midway point of a strange, restless day of fast-forward cricket, junk cricket, cricket off its meds, there was a sense of barriers dissolving, of a top order intent not just on playing the old favourites, but playing them all at the same time. Ben Duckett kicked things off with three fresh-air swipes in his first five balls. He crunched Mitchell Starc off his pads. He whirled his bat like a club. He was almost bowled, almost caught and almost caught-and-bowled. Absurd walking ramps were essayed. A forward defensive drew vast pantomime roars from the banks of English fans. Zak Crawley stood still and hit Michael Neser’s seventh ball high over long-off for six, a beautifully crisp moment of clarity in the middle of all that heat and noise. The opening partnership reached fifty off off 6.5 overs. Duckett walked off shortly after with 34 off 26, yorked playing a kind of cave-ball defensive bunt, but having also produced surely one of the strangest active top-order Test innings in the history of this ground. And there was more too, as Brydon Carse walked out at No 3 with more than a hundred runs still required for victory. Ideally Carse at this point would have raised his left elbow to the skies and ground his way to 27 off 117 balls, thereby genuinely sticking it to the man, freaking out the squares and subverting the dominant paradigm. He didn’t do this. Instead he played every conceivable cricket shot, pure movement, un-choreographed shapes, free flowing physical ballet, en route to a horrible six. There was a vague sense of desecration about all this. Australia venerates Test cricket. This matters here. It speaks to the land, the culture, the triumphant separation from the colonial past. In Adelaide they agonise about letting you in through the media entrance without a collar. In Melbourne the G at Christmas is a secular cathedral, a temple of chino and blue twill shirt, a fixed cultural point. Except, now Duckett is out there playing meth-ball. Carse has gone out to bat in chaps. Brendon McCullum is lounging back so far in his chair, feet up, he’s in danger of disappearing into a ball of pure human insolence. And as England walked off at tea, 77 for two and going along at six and a half an over, the ghost of something long since pronounced dead on the table, the Bazball that dare not speak its name, had never felt so horribly alive. Albeit, only alive in in a desiccated way, leathery and Botoxed, pumped full of meds, telling everyone it’s never felt so young. This was not a vindication of anything. But it was a note of grace, a tick in the box for all that. England’s approach to batting made perfect sense here. A successful chase and a four-wicket win was a reminder of the basic logic of playing this way on a pitch that just kept on seaming. And right now there are two things worth saying about it. First, any England team winning a Test in Australia is a real thing. On day two here, England bowled Australia out for 132 a bowler down, then smashed an excellent attack around the park on a tough pitch. In doing so they completed a first Test win since Sydney in 2011. This has been a place of annihilation, collapse, trauma, careers in turnaround. Whatever the state of the series, this is a genuine achievement, and a tick for the regime. But let us be clear also: it is by no means a vindication of another losing tour, or of a failing executive tier. In fact, this is the opposite. What winning in Melbourne says is: here is what you could have had. Here is evidence that Australia were vulnerable, and for good reason too. They came into this game with three all-time bowlers missing. Mitch Starc has had to play every Test. The batting isn’t really there. This team was vulnerable. But England just weren’t ready to press their fingers into the those tender points. They kicked off in Perth playing jet-lag cricket, eyes wide, still trying to work out what day it was. A properly prepped, balanced and weaponised team might be doing more than simply taking a dead rubber on a wonky pitch. Instead a talented, biddable, slightly raw group of players has been betrayed at times, by short cuts and poor planning. A backroom energy that was initially inspiring, and whose spirit flickered here again in that chase, hasn’t known how to transform an idea and a set of slogans into a winning machine. Or at least, not yet, anyway. Victory here will stand on its own. But it must also serve as a reprimand, a note of internal frustration about complacency, slackness, and how easy it is to miss these opportunities. England will now have a fair chance of winning in Sydney too, and of chasing this series right to its hypothetical finish line. They turned cricket into darts here. They did the thing, finally, that they always promised to do. But who knows how the southern summer might look now if they’d started running a little earlier.",Barney Ronay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the heart of the plot: why did an innocent-looking kid called Jamie (Owen Cooper) commit such a brutal murder? The third episode lifted the lid. As Jamie is interviewed by psychologist Briony (Erin Doherty), we see him slowly reveal that he’s not an innocent kid, but warped by misogyny and a twisted sense of entitlement. The episode was captivating in its acting, but it stayed with you: from Jamie’s sudden switch from vulnerability to manipulation, to the moment the camera zooms in on Briony’s face as she registers who Jamie really is. Horrifying. Not only did The Celebrity Traitors have the best reality show casting of all time, but there were also so many scenes of hilarity and joy that it resulted in some of the best television of the year.

Bafta has a TV moment of the year award, so I look forward to May 2026, when an acclaimed actor with a five-decade career wins a Bafta for … passing wind. EastEnders has had a belter of a year, from its faultless 40th anniversary live episode to an opening scene of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) . The soap also had a homage to one of its greatest and , when Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) yelled “you ain’t my mother!” to Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), who responded … “YES I AM!” Zoe’s high-profile return took place on the same street, in the rain, with the characters spaced just as they were when the exchange took place. Goosebumps. When the BBC teamed up with Disney to help fund and distribute , it was anticipated that this supercharged “Whoniverse” would herald an exciting new era for the long-running sci-fi show. Yet despite some ambitious Russell T Davies storytelling, ratings sagged, Ncuti Gatwa quit and Disney decided not to renew the deal. Yet this wasn’t the most surprising part. It was the ending to the series finale The Reality War, where The Doctor regenerated into … 2005 companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper).

News of their departure not only blindsided viewers, but also the show’s judges, dancers and contestants. The timing was weird, too. Was it to get ahead of a tabloid paper? And why didn’t the BBC press office announce their departure at the same time? Strange. Prime Video shows are usually a hodge podge of random ideas drawn out of a hat (Lord of the Rings and the short-lived reboot of Neighbours, for instance). This year they had a bona fide hit with a super simple premise: put a bunch of comedians in a room and make them compete to get each other to laugh – without laughing themselves. It resulted in some truly unhinged television: Joe Wilkinson’s surreal , Daisy May Cooper imitating a rollercoaster ride with and the fridge being opened to find a . The format was a playground for Bob Mortimer, who made Judi Love laugh simply by . His steely resistance to humour made him the outright winner, even Richard Ayoade. The fact that Mortimer has already been confirmed to return in the second series almost makes up for him not being in The Celebrity Traitors. In 2014, Bake Off contestant Iain thought his baked alaska was doomed after fellow contestant Diana temporarily took it out of the freezer. It resulted in him dumping I know. A simpler time, but I digress. Almost 10 years on, Iain, a different contestant with the same name, decided to make a tribute to the moment in his showstopper. Not by baking a baked alaska. No. He baked us the bin. Paul Hollywood later criticised the bin’s flavours (a sentence I never thought I would write). Iain (the 2025 baker) responded: “Those were Iain’s original flavours. I’m not trying to pass the buck!” Hollywood then broke the fourth wall addressing 2014 Iain. “I really didn’t like the bake. I’m so sorry.” Saturday Kitchen is usually the home of cooking demonstrations, old Rick Stein clips and if you’re lucky, some . However, one episode this year went off the rails. When the public had to vote on whether James Acaster and Ed Gamble’s “food heaven” was to be cooked, loser Acaster did a dramatic overreaction, then attacking a Christmas tree. Bon appetit. which is like Breaking Bad meets Lost, started with protagonist Carol (Rhea Seehorn) watching on in horror as everyone around her convulses without explanation. Carol races home, turns on the television and flicks through the channels, hoping to find some reassuring news. Instead, in an almighty twist, Carol finds a man in the White House press room asking her directly to ring the number on the screen, who breaks the news to her that humanity has been taken over by a happy hive mind. But don’t worry Carol, he reassures her. “Your life is your own.” You can tell an OG fan of video game adaptation The Last of Us by whether they knew about before it actually happened. Joel’s death was particularly brutal. A revenge attack by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) after Joel killed her father, he was shot and repeatedly beaten with a golf club and then stabbed. Ellie (Bella Ramsey) could only look on in horror, as she saw Joel’s demise. One of the standout documentaries of the year was when Louis Theroux saw first hand how Israeli settlements have accelerated in the West Bank. In one encounter, settlers point a laser sight through the window of a Palestinian home he visits. In another scene, he asks a balaclava-wearing armed Israeli soldier not to touch him while visiting a high-security area of Hebron with a Palestinian resident. Towards the end of the episode, we see a tense exchange between Theroux and Daniella Weiss, a leading figure in the settler movement. After Weiss denies settler violence against Palestinians, Theroux presses back that there’s video evidence. Weiss responds by unexpectedly shoving Theroux, hoping that he responds, as part of her explanation that such video evidence does not show the full picture. “That seems sociopathic,” responds Theroux. Ouch. Despite an A-list cast of Kim Kardashian, Glenn Close and Sarah Paulson, Ryan Murphy’s female-fronted legal drama All’s Fair became It might end up being the only accolade the show will ever get. Described by Lucy Mangan as “so awful, it feels almost contemptuous,” the plot, pacing, acting and script were all diabolical, resulting in, at one point, a 0% rating on the (it has since nudged upwards, but it’s still under 10%.) “I personally think that the first three episodes were the weakest,” . “That was a tough way to start. I’ve seen all nine episodes, and I think it actually adds up to something.” What a ringing endorsement! Eurovision this year was once again overshadowed by the , but one other story that came out from the contest was Maltese entrant Miriana Conte being told that if she wanted to compete, she would have to change “It does sound as if you’re trying to use this sort of quite popular millennial phrase,” Newsnight’s , carefully skirting around what the popular phrase actually was. “To me, it means ‘serving singing’,” Conte said. However, as Conte’s performance saw her singing in front of a screen of a giant pair of open legs, I’m pretty sure everyone knew what she was referring to anyway.

To view this content, We now turn to This Morning, the daytime show that once broadcast a “vagina facial” and an interview with a couple who orgasm 18 hours a day by hugging. At one point this year, there was an item about “barebacking,” which is not what you think it is, but rather when young people travel without wearing backpacks or using their mobile phones. Rylan refused to participate in the discussion in case the chat went off the rails, which it inevitably did anyway. Acclaimed Northern Ireland police drama Blue Lights has a knack for luring you in with a false sense of security (here are the coppers having a nice snack in their police car!) before an unexpected twist or heart-rending scene that leaves you on the floor. Episode five was a textbook example, when officers joked and followed swiftly by an altercation where Shane (Frank Blake) became unable to use both legs after being attacked in the thigh with a wine glass. Yet that wasn’t even the most tense moment. It was that episode’s cliffhanger: an active threat against a vehicle being driven by Constable Grace Ellis (Siân Brooke) with the attackers following them in the car behind (“Is your vehicle armoured or soft-skinned?” “We’re soft-skinned, soft-skinned.” “Shit.”) Yikes. Good Morning Britain usually consists of two people with opposing views yelling at each other about a non-essential issue at 7.45am. Yet this year, the breakfast show went in a more surreal direction with Peppa Pig’s Mummy Pig announcing live on the programme that she was pregnant with her third piglet. Naturally, the country and all news media lost all sense of proportion. When Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig presented new baby Evie outside the Lindo Wing, the same hospital where the Princess of Wales had her baby a decade earlier, the Daily Mail reported concerns about why Mummy and Daddy Pig had both gone private rather than going with the NHS. No, I am not taking any of this out of context.

It makes me cringe just watching it,” Morgan told Who Do You Think You Are?, as her head started rotating slowly. Classic. Have I Got News for You has a knack for recording an episode when major news breaks, such as its post-2015 election special when both the then Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg coincidentally stood down mid-recording. Earlier this year, another such event happened again. When news came that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had lost his royal title, the production team slipped the development to guest host Jason Manford, who revealed it to a shocked audience.

The inevitable frantic re-editing led to a bizarre sequence noticed by viewers, when the exact same shot of Wallace appeared three times in less than a minute. It wouldn’t be a TV moments list without a few British news fails. Howler of the Year went to Sky News, with a guest on their paper review commenting that it was “great” that Pope Francis was feeling better from double pneumonia, only for it to be followed by breaking news that Innuendo of the Year was a heated battle between East Midlands BBC Weather presenter Rob Rose who said “and you can probably see Uranus as well” (he was actually talking about the clear night sky) and the Irish breakfast television presenter who asked viewers “how much is a ?” when he meant to say 99.

Known for his surreally bittersweet short stories, George Saunders has written only one novel so far – but that one won the Booker prize. The follow-up to 2017’s Lincoln in the Bardo, (Bloomsbury) focuses on an unquiet spirit called Jill who helps others pass over from life to whatever comes next. She is called to the deathbed of an oil tycoon who is rapidly running out of time to face up to his ecological crimes, in a rallying cry for human connection and environmental action. Ali Smith’s (Hamish Hamilton) is a companion to 2024’s Gliff, and promises to tell a story initially hidden in that previous novel. Expect fables, siblings, phantoms and horses in a typically playful shout of resistance against war, genocide and the increasingly hostile social discourse. And in (Jonathan Cape), Julian Barnes announces his own – this blend of memoir and fiction, exploring memory, illness, mortality and love across the decades, will be his last book. “Your presence has delighted me,” he assures the reader. “Indeed, I would be nothing without you.” The Hamnet adaptation hits UK cinemas in January, but Maggie O’Farrell’s next novel isn’t out until June. (Tinder), a multigenerational saga which opens in 19th-century Ireland in the wake of the famine, is inspired by her own family history and centres on a man tasked with mapping the country for the Ordnance Survey. There’ll be much anticipation, too, for from Elizabeth Strout (Viking, May). The ultra-prolific Strout is adored for her interconnected novels, but this story of a man with a secret is a standalone, introducing characters we’ve never met before. In (Picador, May) Douglas Stuart, author of much-loved Booker winner Shuggie Bain, portrays a young gay man returning home from art school to the lonely croft on the Hebridean island where he grew up. And September sees a new novel from Irish writer Sebastian Barry: (Faber) follows Costa winner Days Without End and A Thousand Moons in transporting the reader to late 19th-century America in the aftermath of the Civil War. Apart from his pulpy collaboration with Keanu Reeves on The Book of Elsewhere, fantasy legend China Miéville hasn’t published a novel for adults since 2011’s Embassytown. (Picador, September) has been 20 years in the writing and promises dark conspiracies and uncanny forces in a continent-spanning epic. Other returns to look out for include John Lanchester with a black comedy of entitlement and generational resentment set amid the metropolitan elite, (Faber, March), and Life of Pi author Yann Martel’s ambitious (Canongate, April), in which a classical scholar uncovers a lost account of the Trojan war. The translated poem unfolds at the top of the page, with heartfelt footnotes addressed to his young daughter below, in a meditation on mythmaking, homemaking and storytelling. Gwendoline Riley has built a reputation as a deadpan genius of dysfunctional relationships; she follows 2021’s My Phantoms with (Picador, April), a sly dark comedy about a long friendship between two prickly people enduring in the face of the world’s disappointments. Asako Yuzuki’s Butter, featuring a gourmet cook turned serial killer, has become a slow-burn sensation (“There are two things that I can simply not tolerate: feminists and margarine”). Author and translator Polly Barton are reunited in (4th Estate, March), another exploration of food, friendship and female experience in contemporary Japan. Three award winners return. Tayari Jones took the Women’s prize for American Marriage in 2019; (Oneworld, March) focuses on two motherless daughters in the segregated American south. Geetanjali Shree follows up her 2022 International Booker winner Tomb of Sand with (translated by Rahul Soni, And Other Stories, February), charting women’s lives in India. And in (Serpent’s Tail, June), M John Harrison, whose previous novel The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again won the Goldsmiths prize in 2020, continues his unsettling destabilisation of our contemporary moment. Second novels to get excited about include Louise Kennedy’s follow-up to the award-winning and recently seen-on-TV Trespasses; (Bloomsbury, September) traces the relationship of two Irish teenagers from the early 80s onwards. In Jacqueline Crooks’s (Cape, August), the Fire Rush author focuses on a woman in 90s London trying to escape her past. Gabriel Tallent’s 2017 debut My Absolute Darling divided readers with its intense tale of an abusive father and his rebellious daughter; the follow-up (Fig Tree, February) is a portrait of friendship and thrill-seeking between two young climbers in an impoverished California community . Megha Majumdar won high praise with her 2020 debut A Burning. (Scribner, January) is another depiction of Indian inequality, set in a near-future Kolkata ravaged by climate change; while in (Oneworld, February) Deepa Anappara follows her acclaimed 2020 adventure about children under threat in an Indian shantytown, Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line, with a historical novel featuring outsiders venturing into the Forbidden Kingdom of Tibet.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/26/country-diary-little-rituals-to-help-sparrows-and-wrens,Country diary: Little rituals to help sparrows and wrens,2025-12-26T05:30:00.000Z,"Boxing Day has its own more violent customs between humans and animals. That’s not the world I choose to live in he sparrows are a shuffling, chirruping shadow in the bushes, a static of anticipation. They are waiting for food, calling for it. They have not forgotten what the poet Emily Dickinson describes, in her poem , as “God keeps his oath to sparrows, / Who of little love / Know how to starve!” However, sparrows do seem to live in a much more vivid and emotional society than as mere victims of an indifferent nature that is economical at the expense of compassion. To say they come to the feeding station sounds a bit grand for a small bird table, a few hanging fat balls and a scattering of seed and mealworms in a back yard in Oswestry. The first adventurers edge in, not just to explore the food source but to play in a space of subtle changes that have happened in their place. When the whole move in, there must be over 30 birds. The energy of their performance is contagious. Moving through a home range of gardens, this clan know each other intimately. Feeding together, they have hair-trigger reactions. The slightest disturbance sends them all thrumming for cover at the speed of thought that looks telepathic – more fun than panic. Sparrow culture involves complex behaviours with other birds in this community of place: blue tits, robins, jackdaws, collared doves, blackbirds, wood pigeons and wrens. To the streets outside, where at the winter solstice there is a in honour of the wren. What began as a reimagined ritual inspired by the folklore around has changed into providing a sanctuary for the wren within the community. Such a ritual performance is not to live in the past tense, but to live as the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam suggested in the imperative of the future passive participle: “ A ritual for the protection of wrens, like the ritual feeding of sparrows – incomprehensibly on the red list of British birds of conservation concern – seeks to perform what ought to be, not what was or might be. I hope you get this on Boxing Day, which, whatever it’s about, traditionally involves claiming to imitate nature’s economy over compassion. Ought it?

He and stars Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Andra Day talk gags, growth and relationship goals ast Christmas, the audience at an open-mic night in New York welcomed to the stage a new standup. Alex Novak, he said his name was. Mildly funny, bit depressed. Mostly told jokes about getting divorced. Weirdest thing though: he looked “I was so naively unaware of what to expect,” says , almost a year later. “I’ve been comedy-adjacent for a lot of my life, but not a comedian. I had no idea what I was in for.” That was a crash course in confessional standup. Five nights a week, for six weeks, Arnett would write and perform material across the city, going up cold, ignoring any hecklers who might insist he was actually the star of one of the US’s best-loved sitcoms, as well as , Blades of Glory, The Lego Movie etc. All this to prepare for his first dramatic movie lead as a man who walks into a bar, finds he can dodge the entrance fee if he agrees to five minutes on stage in the basement comedy club – and finds himself in the process. “Every time a comic goes on stage, they are jumping off a cliff,” says Arnett. “It’s unnerving and very scary.” Sometimes it paid off. One night he went to a club, “and it. They loved it. Really vibed with me. And then I went around the corner to a different club, did the same jokes, and completely bombed.” Some actors are smaller than you expect. Arnett is more substantial: tall and brawny. Still, he withers at the memory. “There’s nowhere to hide. You feel your soul leaving your body. I’d gone up with such confidence, but there was just this profound silence. The only laughter I could hear was at the back of the room, and it was Bradley.” . This is his third film as writer-director; he also co-stars as Alex’s best friend, a vain actor called Balls. Also rubbernecking from the crowd that night was Andra Day, who plays Balls’ waspish wife Christine. “It was so cool to watch Will’s body absorb how the audience was not responding,” she says with glee. “Every little gesture. How uncomfortable his head was.” Day is a singer-songwriter; years of gigs mean she knows how it feels when patter dies. “But I have the luxury of saying: ‘All right! Let’s play the next track! Move on!’” Arnett, however, struggled to turn a doomed ship around. “You try to recalibrate by amping up the delivery,” he says, but then people seem yet more repelled. “Comedy is much more of a conversation than I realised. You have to listen to them respond before you build toward the punchline. To let them be invested. You want them to lean in.” Cooper’s films are, it’s fair to say, interested in this transaction. In how performing both feeds and leeches; how being adored or torn apart by strangers affects your personal life. A Star Is Born, Maestro and Is This Thing On? all feature scenes in which someone falls in love (or back in love) with the protagonist as they perform live. “What seems to recur,” says Cooper – or, in fact, emails, of which more later – “is the idea that artistic expression requires a vulnerability that reveals something deeply human. In each of the films, the moment of falling in love happens when that truth becomes visible.” In this case, that happens when Alex’s ex, Tess (Laura Dern), goes on a date with another man and they wind up at a club where Alex happens to be performing. Unseen at the back, unaware the man she was married to for decades had ever even considered comedy, she watches agog, by turns appalled, amused – and turned on. “Tess glimpses the person she once loved coming back into focus,” says Cooper. In a London hotel room down the hall from Arnett, Dern leans forward keenly. “This theme of committing to being unhappy with someone touches me ,” she says. “It’s the same experience many of us have had in a relationship: how did we get here? How have we lost ourselves and each other? The film taught me a lot as a woman about the goal of a relationship – that it has to be that whole journey all the time. Because,” she continues, “we are ever-evolving organisms!” She smiles: engaged, evangelical even, all empathy and connection. Alex and Tess reconcile as each finds the freedom to explore their own passions (him: comedy, her: basketball). Growth is essential, the film suggests. So is realism. Being unhappy with someone isn’t great, but being unhappy alongside them might be the best we can hope for. Dern thinks her generation (she’s 58) is often too entrenched to compromise, let alone reinvent. Her children – Ellery, 25, and Jaya, 21– are wiser. “They have been raised with so much noise around performative social media living,” she says. “‘Let’s show everybody how this moment feels! Let’s see how many followers care about it!’ So they’re now like: can we just put it away and actually just be connected and honest and a mess?” She shudders. “Showing people what you’re eating or wearing feels like middle-school all the time. Being judged for the length of my skirt or what I said to the boy. Oh my God, it’s exhausting!” In the room next door, Day (40) says she has no time for artifice. “People’s arrogance is often just really deep-seated insecurity,” she says. “We’re only getting half-versions of everyone as they’re trying to hide.” Once you drop the act, she says, “you never wanna go back in, to disappear into the performative part of life ever again.” The original idea for the film was Arnett’s. It came after a chance meeting with the Liverpudlian comedian , who did indeed first try standup to avoid paying a cover charge, took to it, started using it as quasi-counselling, then reconnected with the mother of his children after she accidentally saw him perform. The main difference between fact and fiction is the quality of the jokes. Bishop became successful; Alex probably won’t. “Yeah,” says Arnett, “if Alex wants to keep doing this, he’s got to get funny.” When we spoke, Stephen Colbert’s late-night satirical talkshow . US TV comedy seemed especially imperilled. Yet, Arnett – a staple of the scene for 25 years – was circumspect. “It is and it isn’t under threat. It’s always been like that. The court jester looked over his shoulder to make sure he pleased the king. So I don’t know if I am particularly troubled. There are plenty of people out there pushing the boundaries and finding a way to do it. It probably forces you to be a little more clever.” What drew him to the story was not the comedy, he says, but the drama – a chance to flex other muscles and draw on some unfunny personal history. “It demanded I look at my own experiences. And you don’t have to know much about me to know there are strains and commonalities.” Arnett is referring to his own split from Amy Poehler, with whom he has two sons, in 2012. At the time, it was major gossip in the US; the personal lives of both parties remain, like that of Cooper, tabloid catnip. , Is This Thing On? is not about people who are enormously famous. And yet, like Noah Baumbach’s (considerably inferior) – which also features Dern – its concerns betray the fact it was made by people who So there is quite a lot about how uncomfortable it feels to see massive photos of yourself you don’t feel are representative of your whole being. Alex enlarges to poster size a photo he loves of Tess spectacularly sinking a hoop decades earlier. She’s not flattered. “It’s because that’s not ,” says Dern. “It’s an idea of her. And that is the story of many of our lives: a moment captured in time that someone is still judging us on. I’ve had it from the other side, too, with projection.” Being troubled by such stuff is, concedes Arnett, a first-world problem. “But it is odd to see yourself out there in the world in that way. It’s really weird.” Cooper doesn’t respond on this one. Maybe he doesn’t need to. Given how energetically he hit the press trail for his previous films, plus the themes of this one, it feels significant that he’s opting to back-seat it this time round. Is This Thing On? is a loose and relaxed movie that is also surprisingly sharp on how much of yourself you should supply to strangers in the service of art. Cooper’s email answers are highly considered and curated, script tightly controlled – even now. At one point, Alex’s preteen sons happen upon a rough draft of his father’s latest routine. They’re distressed. “None of that stuff is real,” he says, comforting them. “It’s all made up. None of it’s real life, really.” But that’s not true: Alex is, by and large, impeccably honest. So when does sharing something become betrayal? “I don’t think I could define that boundary for anyone else,” says Cooper. “‘Betrayal’ is a heavy term, and these moments tend to be highly circumstantial. I recall reading not long ago about a comedian whose material left the subject of the joke feeling genuinely betrayed. And if someone feels betrayed by what was shared, then in some sense there is a betrayal. Their emotional reality is valid. “For myself, I’m very deliberate about sharing anything from my private life in a public setting, because other people are inevitably part of those stories, and they haven’t necessarily chosen to be included. It’s something I try to approach with care. That may sound a bit old-fashioned in a culture where everything is shared so freely, but it’s the way I orient myself.” Cooper has an eight-year-old daughter, Lea, who played Leonard Bernstein’s daughter in some of Maestro. Is This Thing On? is bookended by scenes set at school performances. “Bradley said he went to one when we were in preproduction,” says Dern, “and all the kids were having this amazing moment and all the parents were on their phones. And he was like: ‘There’s a ! Dancing! In front of us!’” She rolls her eyes. “We’ve allowed the noise to take over so completely. But if you wake up to self, you wake to your children. To a moment that you may define in your busy adult brain as less important than that text from your boss.” As a parent,” writes Cooper, “watching a school performance becomes a deeply subjective experience. The moment your own child is on stage, a whole world of personal history and emotion comes with you. The audience is essentially a collection of people engaged in private internal narratives – reflecting, remembering, projecting. That shared interiority gives school performances a kind of quiet, unexpected magic.” Those scenes are among the film’s finest. They capture something of the weird potency of guileless prancing. “There’s an innocence to children performing,” says Cooper, “a transparency of feeling, an almost complete indifference to success or failure; they’re simply expressing themselves. Whatever is happening within them is visible, unfiltered – which is ironic, because that’s exactly what adult performers spend their lives trying to recreate: a genuine moment in an imagined circumstance.” It must be strange to be in a profession in which you sweat all day for excellence, then go and watch your kid just casually pull it off without blinking. Is This Thing On? relies on the idea that that toil is worth it and honest adult performance is intrinsically cathartic. More committed, even, than Cooper himself. “I’ve certainly had experiences where it felt quite the opposite – more stressful than liberating,” he writes. “Still, in hindsight, even those moments tend to become cathartic. When you place yourself in a situation that’s uncomfortable and demands you push past your limits, there’s inevitably some emotional release or insight that emerges.” “It’s never not cathartic,” says Dern, ever the pro. “Even if it’s a difficult job or people aren’t feeling fulfilled or they’re missing the point. I have played some rough folks that I don’t necessarily want to admit are a part of me, but I have to find the part of me in them to connect. And that’s exciting.” The rough is hard to spot today. Dern is the definition of polish. She may not be a comedian, but it’s impossible to imagine that, had she been the one taking to the stage, anonymously, in a random comedy club, she wouldn’t have nailed it.

Her son seems cut from the same cloth: “‘This is the best movie to see as I’m starting my journey,’” he told her after watching it. “‘It makes me wanna love by being my most vulnerable.’” She beams with satisfaction. “My generation had fairytales: Prince Charming shows up, you must say yes. So it’s pretty incredible to have an alternative.” And, she adds, gesturing at the TV in the corner, an alternative to all . “I don’t know how I’ve become yet again addicted to checking in on the world right before I go to sleep. A horrible idea. But we have to tune out from the resentments and the fear, and say that because of them, this is the moment we have to be our most connected.” Don’t dismiss Is This Thing On?, she says. This isn’t just industry frippery or a comedy of remarriage. There’s a radical moral at its core. “It could be global, even political, to say: ‘I want to be unhappy with you. I’m fighting for this thing we call life, despite all the noisy, chaotic crap.’ We are all on the planet at the same time. And if we don’t lead with love, we are lost.” Is This Thing On?

Yes, it was fine. But that is where I would like our relationship to end hen I buy something online, I don’t want to receive more than two emails: one to confirm my order has been received, and another to tell me when it will be delivered. The numerous notifications we receive while browsing, buying and then waiting for delivery are presumably meant to be reassuring. But since when is harassment reassuring? Imagine a world in which the second you walk into a shop, someone taps you on the shoulder and asks: “Can I help you today?” Then someone asks for your email address in exchange for a 5% discount. When you find what you are looking for and place it in your basket, this instigates more nuisance. “Hurry! Twenty-one other people have this in their basket too!” Of course 21 other people have this in their basket, it’s shower gel and a significant number of people shower. This doesn’t make you rush. It makes you thrilled that the consensus remains in favour of personal hygiene. You wander around the shop a bit more. Someone grabs your arm. “There is still an item in your basket. Don’t forget to check out!” At the till, there are more questions. “Do you want to give us your information, or check out as a guest?” You check out as a guest. People are meant to be kind to guests. But, after paying, someone screams into your face. “Sign up to this third-party website that has nothing to do with the store and get £15 CASHBACK!!!!!” It couldn’t sound more nefarious. You race out of the shop, pursued by a final assailant. “How did we do? Please rate our service from one to 5!” The bus ride home is no quieter. The driver remarkably announces: “Your item has been dispatched.” An old man next to you nudges your ribs and sagely whispers into your ear: “Your item is on its way.” When you make it home you are greeted by someone who has broken into your house to tell you: “Your item has arrived!” They then run off. They have stolen nothing but your time. At least it is all over. Your transaction is complete. You get into the shower and the cascading water brings you peace at last. Until you read the request that has been etched into the steam on the bathroom mirror. “Please review your purchase!” You do not. Because it is a toiletry item. It was made by a multinational conglomerate, not Andrew Lloyd Webber. And you are tired. Please. If you are a retailer, and you are reading this – leave me alone.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/england-australia-fourth-ashes-test-cricket-reaction-ben-stokes,‘Finally we’ve won one’: Stokes delighted by Ashes Test win but pitch was ‘not ideal’,2025-12-27T10:06:13.000Z,"England captain and Joe Root revel in rarest of victories ‘Narrative that we haven’t won goes back to zero now’ Ben Stokes shared a hug with Joe Root and spoke of an “awesome feeling” after watching his England side claw back some respectability on this failed Ashes tour with Of the England squad, none had felt the pain of an 18-match winless streak more than the captain and his predecessor. Stokes had played in 13 Tests here without tasting a victory, while for Root the number was 17. With both men aged 34, this tour may well have been their last chance. “It’s an awesome feeling,” said Stokes, his side having chased down 175 on a bowler-friendly surface that had produced 36 wickets in six sessions. “To end up on the right side of a result after such a long period of time is a pretty special feeling. “At the end there, when all the boys came out of the dressing room, [Root and myself] had a little hug and just said: ‘Finally we’ve won one’. I’m sure later tonight there might be a few words spoken about it. “We know Australia is a very hard place to win a game, let alone a series. It will be another four years until England come back here, but there won’t be a narrative that we haven’t won a game – that goes back to zero now.” Stokes had looked like a broken man before this fourth Test, with the strain of sitting 3-0 down and criticism of the team’s mid-tour break in Noosa led him to from the public. Losing Jofra Archer to a side strain only deepened the growing sense of crisis. “The couple of days leading up to this Test match were difficult for us,” said Stokes. “The way the leadership group – Baz [the head coach, Brendon McCullum], myself, the other coaches and senior players – were able to keep as much focus as possible on the cricket was important. “Once you do cross that line on to the field you put everything else to one side and your focus switches to what you need to do. When you’re not on the field, things can start fluttering around in your head. The way we were able to keep that focus on the cricket was important in why we were able to get on the right side of the result.” Stokes singled out Josh Tongue for praise after seven wickets in the crapshoot meant he was named player of the match, while the decision to bring in Jacob Bethell paid off with a top score of 40 in the run chase. “Josh has that natural wicket-taking ability that is so hard to come by. He should be very proud of himself because he has bowled some long, big spells and backed it up. He’s been phenomenal. Beth played well coming in under a little bit of pressure from the first innings and to play the way he did shows a lot about his character and the confidence he has within himself.” As regards the pitch, which after having 10mm of grass left on is likely to trigger an investigation by Australia, Stokes said: “When you go out there and you’re faced with conditions, you’ve got to crack on and deal with it. But being brutally honest, that’s not really what you want. Boxing Day Test match, you don’t want a game finishing in less than two days. Not ideal.” Steve Smith, Australia’s stand-in captain, said: “It was obviously a tricky one. Thirty-six wickets over two days [means it] probably offered just a little bit too much. Finances aren’t great, I think it was a sell-out tomorrow. So, yeah, disappointing for those [fans] that wanted to come along.” The nature of the win means the sides have seven days to recover before the fifth Test in Sydney – a match that could hold huge significance for England and the futures of McCullum and the team director, Rob Key. One player almost certain to be missing is Gus Atkinson after straining his hamstring, with Matthew Potts the next seamer in line for a spot in England’s attack.",Ali Martin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right outside, the River Wandle is awake and bursting with life. The grey heron swoops down and swiftly lands with a big splash, then stands up, still as a statue.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/25/you-be-the-judge-my-partner-is-obsessed-with-our-homes-water-consumption-should-he-stop,You be the judge: my partner is obsessed with our home’s water consumption. Should he stop?,2025-12-25T08:00:35.000Z,"Peter is waging war on the water company but Winnie feels his policing of usage is overbearing. You decide whose argument gets flushed away My boyfriend, Peter, is obsessed with monitoring our water consumption and it’s driving me insane. It started innocently enough. One evening, he noticed our water bill was high. I shrugged it off, but he tried to get the water company to reduce the bill, and when he couldn’t, he became obsessive. Every night, he started going outside with his torch, checking the water meter, as if he were a security guard doing the rounds. He’s now implemented these rules. Peter times my showers and nags me not to flush the toilet after a wee, which I think is gross. He’s forever sending me articles about the optimal shower length, or how many litres of water are used during a toilet flush. When I wash my hair, which takes time because it’s thick and curly, I hear Peter sigh loudly in the hallway. Afterwards, he says things like, “you probably used the weekly quota in there”, and “30 mins is 300 litres of water, you know”, while showing me the timer on his phone. Who gets to decide the weekly quota? We’ve lived together for four years, and I’m not up for being monitored. Peter behaves as if we’re in a drought. He makes me reuse the water after I’ve boiled eggs. I don’t have a problem with that in theory, but it’s annoying always having a pan out – one time I knocked it over. Peter also wants us to limit our dishwasher use – he only thinks we should use it after we’ve accumulated lots of pots and pans. I refuse. He also recently tried to show me a spreadsheet he’d made comparing the efficiency of different showerheads. We live in an area where the water provider constantly puts up bills, and it makes Peter angry. I get it, but there’s not much we can do. I respect sustainability, but Peter’s fixation feels invasive. I don’t tell him how long he can spend in the shower or running the tap when he brushes his teeth. Bills go up, that’s life. I just want to shower in peace without feeling as though I’m being observed by the water police. Winnie may hate that I’m a little obsessed with water, but I’m not trying to be controlling. I just want to stop getting scammed by the water company and drowning in bills. It’s for both of us. I’m an electrician and she’s an artist, so we aren’t rolling in money. So yes, I check the meter and make spreadsheets comparing showerheads, but it’s for the greater good. It’s not true that I time Winnie’s showers like a prison guard. I simply make a note if they go above 30 mins, because apparently 30 minutes in the shower can use up to 400 litres of water. Winnie has started saving water from boiling eggs and I appreciate that. She did get annoyed when she knocked the pan on to the floor, but that shouldn’t be a reason not to save water. The bigger issue is that Winnie wants to run our dishwasher twice a day and flush the toilet after dropping a single tissue in it. I’m just trying to fight back against a corrupt water company that keeps hiking our bills while paying dividends to shareholders. I’m a bit of an anarchist at heart, and said we should stop paying our bills and see what happens, but Winnie wouldn’t let me. The problem is that everyone just lets these companies do what they want. We need to fight back. Winnie grew up in a posh part of the UK, whereas I had a more working-class upbringing. She loves long showers, having a cleaner and buying nice food. And that’s fine – so do I – but in order to afford lovely things, we need to get smart about saving money elsewhere. We want to have kids, but we need to tighten our belts first – that includes using the dishwasher less and having shorter showers. I’ve tried to get us to agree on only loading the dishwasher once a day and taking shorter showers. Winnie sees these as punishments. But they’re small steps toward fiscal and environmental responsibility. I’m not the villain here. I’m the partner trying to save money so she can have a nice life. Winnie has compromised by reusing the egg water. Perhaps she could also compromise on the dishwasher, but Peter won’t win against the water companies by being passive-aggressive to Winnie through the bathroom door. Let a woman shower in peace. Peter has translated “penny wise and pound foolish” into a plumbing context. Sure, the pennies he’ll save by counting the litres will add up. But will they be worth the damage he’s clearly doing to his relationship with Winnie? Life’s not measured out by the litre. I’m all for saving water but there must be ways to be creative about it without making your partner anxious. I suggest Peter joins a campaign to hold the water company to account as it will help him to feel he’s making a difference. Good on him for caring – but he needs to keep his relationship afloat. Peter has gone over the line from fiscal and environmental responsibility into controlling, intrusive behaviour. When they moved in together Winnie didn’t agree to these rules, and Peter shouldn’t have imposed them without discussion. We are in a climate crisis, and the sooner we realise that the better. Half-hour showers are excessive. Water is a finite resource that we need to use sparingly, and while studying showerheads may not be everyone’s cup of tea, mother nature needs more Peters. of you said yes – Joe is guilty of you said no – Joe is not guilty",Georgina Lawton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/27/morocco-no-longer-continental-pariah-as-afcon-showcases-its-global-standing,Morocco no longer continental pariah as Afcon showcases its global standing,2025-12-27T08:00:33.000Z,"Country pulled out of hosting 2015 tournament but has since become central figure within world football It is hard to conceive that Morocco, now the nerve centre for staging Africa’s marquee football events, was a continental pariah 10 years ago. Abruptly pulling out of hosting the 2015 , over fears it would lead to the spread of the Ebola virus in the kingdom, forced the Confederation of African Football to move the tournament to Equatorial Guinea, with less than 90 days to prepare for its staging. For Hicham El Amrani, the Moroccan who was then Caf’s general secretary, it was a tough period. “The pressure I was under can only be imagined, as I was pulled in different directions,” he later said. “It is a time I would like to forget.” It led to Morocco’s ban from the next two Afcons and punitive fines from Caf which were overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. That is a distant memory. Hosting the ongoing Afcon and the past two women’s Afcons – in 2022 and this year, with another Wafcon to be played there in March and April 2026 – and staging the 2030 men’s World Cup, primarily with Portugal and Spain, shows the north African country’s importance “Being in my 40s, I have been a witness to all the unsuccessful bids to host the World Cup,” says Amine El Amri, the head of sport at Le360 and one of Morocco’s most respected football journalists. “Hosting the World Cup is a project that engages every Moroccan in a common dream, knowing that a World Cup tournament comes at a cost but also with a huge boost to the infrastructure of a very young and very demanding society.” Omar Khyari, head of international relations at the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), says forging close cultural, economic and diplomatic ties with the rest of Africa after the 2015 incident was a 2017 policy decision of King Mohammed VI, the country’s absolute monarch. Abderrahim Bourkia, a sports sociology professor at Hassan I University, goes further. “From a socioeconomic perspective, these tournaments are instruments of symbolic capital in the Bourdieusian sense, converted into political and economic capital. Mega-events accelerate urban development, modernise transport and stadiums, stimulate tourism and create temporary and long-term employment. At the same time, they contribute to a collective national narrative, strengthening social cohesion, pride and international visibility. “These events would generate hope around employment, infrastructure and development. I don’t know if I should use ‘should’ instead of ‘would’, but these events raise some questions: How do we ensure the benefits are socially inclusive? How do we avoid event-based development that overlooks everyday inequalities? And how do we transform football enthusiasm into sustainable public policy? Hosting these tournaments signifies Morocco’s capacity for organisation, to be trusted, and to project power symbolically. But it also challenges the country to translate sporting prestige into lasting social gains. And I think we could, if we think about it.” El Amri believes encounters with international visitors to Morocco help redefine national identity. “Moroccans look at themselves through the gaze of the other,” he says. “This can strengthen pride in cultural heritage: our music, our food and crafts, and religious tolerance, while also encouraging selective modernisation and openness. “Football becomes a stage for symbolic recognition, where Morocco asserts its Africanness and its global belonging. The society is a melting pot consisting of an Amazigh, Saharan, Arabic and southern European mixture. Opening the country to others is key in a world where power is shifting on a regular basis. It is strategic to know where we are and whom we are supposed to interact with, in order to find our proper and fitting place.” Sunday Oliseh, who won Afcon with Nigeria in 1994 and is working as an analyst at the ongoing tournament, knows Morocco well. The former Super Eagles captain and head coach is married to a Belgian-Moroccan. “I first came to Morocco in 1997 … We visit Morocco a lot and were here in August, in Tangier. For me, it is the most developed nation that I have seen in Africa over the last 30 years … Let anyone show you pictures of how Morocco was 30 years ago and compare it to now. It should really motivate other countries in Africa, especially my own, Nigeria, to make real progress.” in late September and early October included accusations that the Moroccan government was prioritising spending on World Cup stadiums over social services. The government, which denied that, has since said it is . Human rights groups have alleged the demonstrations led to the In a football context, winning Afcon is the holy grail for ordinary Moroccans, the country having last secured the title in 1976. Hosting the 1988 tournament and the past two Wafcons did not bring home success but El Amri says the country’s goals as hosts go far beyond titles. “It is an opportunity to showcase not only our capacity to welcome the world but also to emphasise a deeply rooted tradition of being a genuine, open, yet respectful country. Moroccans from all walks of life love football, and seeing superstar players in Morocco is gratifying. On the economic level, it’s a huge boost to a solid industry, even though it is still a developing tourism industry. The image of a welcoming, affordable and secure country goes beyond any PR campaign.” Walid Regragui, Morocco’s manager, is acutely aware, though, that only an Afcon title triumph on 18 January will ensure he leads the team to next year’s World Cup.

Advanced talks on a visit by the king are said to be under way, the Times reported. The paper suggested that Charles’s visit to the US was likely to take place in April. William is expected to make a separate visit to the US later in the year during the World Cup, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June to 19 July. The visit would be the first by a reigning British monarch since Queen Elizabeth II accepted an invitation from George W Bush in 2007. into British tech over trade disagreements. deal, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Trump’s state visit, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas. The decision to put it on hold was a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer had hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president. Earlier in December, Downing Street said the government was still in “active conversations” with the US on the tech deal. But the prime minister’s spokesperson acknowledged that “negotiations of this kind are never straightforward”. Reports suggested US negotiators had become frustrated by slow progress in agreeing a wider trade deal announced in May 2025, when Britain escaped the 20% tariffs that the US president imposed on much of the rest of the world. Britain’s digital services tax, opposed by Trump’s big tech backers, and the sensitive issue of greater access to British markets for US farmers, are thought to be sticking points. It is possible that the visit will be timed to ensure that the prince is in the US for Independence Day, the Times reported. The prime minister is not expected to accompany the king on the visit. Instead, the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, is likely to attend to represent the government, according to reports. William is expected to visit the US during the World Cup in his capacity as the president of the Football Association. England’s third group match is being played on 27 June in New Jersey, a week before the 250th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence celebrations on 4 July. For the bicentennial celebrations of independence in 1976, the queen and Prince Philip visited Philadelphia, Washington DC and New York over six days. The queen was hosted by President Gerald Ford at a White House state dinner. She spoke of her visit during her Christmas broadcast the same year, and said: “This year we went to America to join in their bicentennial celebrations. Who would have thought 200 years ago that a descendant of King George III could have taken part in these celebrations? Yet that same king was among the first to recognise that old scores must be settled and differences reconciled.” She added: “The United States was born in bitter conflict with Britain but we didn’t remain enemies for long.” Buckingham Palace declined to comment, stating it did not comment on upcoming royal engagements.",Olivia Lee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/26/us-right-champions-psychedelic-drugs,Conservative and Christian? US right champions psychedelic drugs,2025-12-26T13:00:10.000Z,"Texas governor among those to call for expanded access to ibogaine, said to help with treating veterans with PTSD or half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires. Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles. “The psychedelic renaissance is three things: capitalized, conservative and Christian,” Jamie Wheal, author of Recapture the Rapture: Rethinking God, Sex, and Death in a World That’s Lost Its Mind, wrote in an article titled Make America Hallucinate Again. “The tactical decision to make the face of [the psychedelic reform] movement has now taken on a life of its own.” After the Food and Drug Administration’s rejection of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD last year, ibogaine is now center stage. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, signed off on a landmark $50m funding package for ibogaine research in June, the “great promise” of the drug in treating conditions suffered by veterans – more of whom live in Texas than Reform discussions are also under way sanctioning legal ibogaine treatments, in which patients embark on rollercoaster trips of about 12 hours. “It has a breakthrough therapeutic impact on veterans who have experienced all the visible and invisible traumas of war, including traumatic brain injuries, which have been fully resolved with a single ibogaine treatment,” says , CEO of advocacy group Americans for Ibogaine and a lawyer from Kentucky who often references his personal prayer, Isaiah 61:1. “This very special emancipation medication has the capacity to substantially improve treatment outcomes for afflictions that affect the mind, body and soul.” In a Stanford University study published in Nature Medicine, 30 US special forces veterans who underwent ibogaine treatment in Mexico experienced significant reductions in traumatic brain injury (TBI), PTSD and depression symptoms. A month later, most of the patients had improved even further, without any reported side-effects. Hubbard, a Universalist Christian, says the irony of conservative Republicans like himself standing at the forefront of the campaign to provide legal access to psychedelic therapies is not lost on him. His own legal experiences in clinics in Mexico with ibogaine, however, were “the most profound spiritual experiences in my life”. But there is growing scrutiny of the apparent victory of the cultural right in who gets to define psychedelic healing, and what Wheal has described bleakly as a “counter-counter-cultural turn” in the psychedelics world. “The psychedelic [QAnon] shaman storming the White House on January 6 was an early awakening that within Maga there could be rightwing psychonauts,” says , director of the non-profit Global Ibogaine Therapy Alliance. Ibogaine, which Hunter Biden took in 2014 in a failed attempt to address his drug and alcohol addiction, is “a maverick molecule for a maverick moment”, Weate adds, after its accidental discovery as a treatment for opioid addiction in the 1960s by heroin addict and film-maker Howard Lotsof. But as clinics in legal jurisdictions expand to cope with the rising demand, the dream-inducing psychedelic – which can rid addicts of even debilitating withdrawal symptoms, while also providing consumers with autobiographical and sometimes distressing movies of their lives – is “just becoming a pill you take”, Weate says, as part of a “ruthlessly transactional” and lucrative American-style healthcare system. That traumatized US veterans and victims of the pharmaceutical industry’s opioid crisis are flocking to Mexico to take an African psychedelic is just one consequence of how the “ ” has migrated to the right in recent years, where libertarian Republican political figures appear keener to take previously unfathomable risks. On 7 September, ketamine therapy enthusiast Elon Musk – whose allies are now some of of psychedelic NGOs, research and drug development – posted : “White people are a rapidly diminishing minority of [the] global population.” A few hours later, : “We cannot understand the true nature of the Universe, unless we question deeply. I want to know what is real, even if the answer is total obliteration of my consciousness.” Towards the end of November, former UFC champion Conor McGregor, who recently lost his appeal in after being alleged to have held his female victim in a chokehold, did ibogaine and claimed to have experienced visions of being initiated by Jesus in “I was shown the light,” he wrote. Jesus descended from the white marble steps of heaven and anointed me with a crown. I was saved! My brain. My heart. My soul. Healed!” McGregor seemingly has political aspirations. He attended Trump’s inauguration in January and visited the president again A week after McGregor’s trip, the “Don’t Die” longevity entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, a Trump who became a centimillionaire after selling the web payments company Braintree in 2013, tripping on mushrooms – with more than a million people watching on X. The billionaire Salesforce CEO, Mark Benioff, joined the live stream just weeks after saying Trump troops into San Francisco to make the city safer. Others at the forefront of calls to expand access to ibogaine treatment include the former Texas governor , who was Trump’s energy secretary from 2017 to 2019 and co-founded Americans for Ibogaine with Hubbard after the Kentucky lawyer worked as an independent contractor for the Reid Foundation, a nonprofit established by Rex Elsass, an ibogaine advocate who has been described as “the most powerful man in the GOP” that nobody has ever heard of. Google co-founder Sergey Brin reportedly made a $15m investment into a startup researching ibogaine Congressman Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy Seal, did ibogaine and another psychedelic, 5-MeO-DMT, also known as “the God molecule” himself in 2018 in Mexico before his election to the House in 2023. He is the only known federal lawmaker to have tripped on the drugs, which he said eased his war traumas. “I was always ready to go,” the Washington Examiner. “I was a hyper-aggressive spec war guy that just couldn’t turn the page and start the new chapter.” But psychedelics were “life-changing” for him. “It was a clean slate; start completely over,” he said. It was much the same for Rob O’Neill, the Navy Seal veteran credited with killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, who says that ibogaine has helped him address his PTSD as part of a grueling set of trips in which he was forced to witness his own demons. “It gets in your brain. It shows you stuff. And it kind of cleans out the closet,” O’Neill told Tucker Carlson But aside from the terrors, the psychedelic experience, says Norman Ohler, author of Tripped: Nazi Germany, the CIA, and the Dawn of the Psychedelic Age, is often characterized by a “unified worldview, without borders or enemies, because you work through your trauma”. Even while he doubts psychedelics can make peace-loving men of the most ardent warmongers, Ohler does not see the apparent upswell in rightwing figures publicly aligning themselves with the psychedelic reform movement as a negative phenomenon. “If both camps are embracing psychedelics, they can be a unifying force for society,” he says. “Maybe psychedelics will destroy fascism.” Ohler also recently took ibogaine himself, for psychospiritual purposes, at a clinic in Mexico alongside a group of veterans, one of whom had been suffering from daily migraines after being shot in the head in Afghanistan years before. “After taking ibogaine, his pain was completely gone,” says Ohler. “This is a very special medicine.” A medicine that also comes with mortal risks. Ibogaine is contraindicated with a host of other drugs and can lead to cardiac arrest, which is why treatments best take place with intensive care ward care and monitoring. A 2021 study that 33 ibogaine-related deaths have been reported publicly, but the true figure is and there have been questions over how certain clinics have dealt with deaths under their care – even while the psychedelic has reportedly transformed thousands of lives. For Hubbard, it is paramount that ibogaine is treated as the “very serious medication” that it is. “I don’t shy away from [the term] psychedelics,” he says. But he does seek to avoid “flamboyant and quixotic” language when making the case. “Someone who is eating a handful of mushrooms and rolling around the mud at Woodstock in 1969 is not a credible advocate for how psychedelics can help deliver individual healing and broader spiritual enlightenment,” he says.

https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/22/fashion-statement-dressing-the-part-tv-characters-top-looks,Dressing the part: the TV characters who nailed small-screen style this year,2025-12-27T08:00:34.000Z,"From Jackson Lamb’s mac in Slow Horses to the queen-bee wardrobe of Wild Cherry, Guardian writers choose the outfits that shaped storylines and revealed personalities in 2025 ever mind the catwalk shows, the viral glossy advertising campaigns and the endless red carpets. This year, TV was where the best fashion was at. Here, nine Guardian writers pick their favourite looks from the shows that had us hooked over the past 12 months. Season one of Nobody Wants This was about the Hot Rabbi, but season two is all about the Hot Little Sister. Morgan, played by Succession’s Justine Lupe, steals every scene she’s in. She is a brilliant physical comic, and her outfits are key. In the first episode, big sis Joanne (Kristen Bell) is adulting hard at her first couple’s dinner party, but a pivotal moment comes when Morgan makes her entrance in a fluffy shearling jacket and hot pants. She is a preening, maddening, gorgeous cat-among-the-pigeons, and you just know from the moment she walks on screen that the night is not going to go to plan. What makes Morgan so compelling is that her vanity is a plot point. There is something so recognisable and heartbreaking about this smart woman who leads with her looks. The hair-flicking tic, the inappropriate stiletto boots for daywear, the Cher in Clueless mix of being charmingly off-the-wall yet infuriatingly self-obsessed. Joanne has a cute overthinky Diane Keaton thing going on with that little frown and her pleat trousers and rollnecks, but it is fashion girl Morgan – in her Wales Bonner track pants and argyle knits, rugby shirts and oversized leather bombers, western-buckle belts and Cali denim – who has my heart. No expense was spared in the costume department for Wild Cherry, the glamorous thriller about two spoiled teenage girls and their mothers whose lives are upended by scandal. It’s Gossip Girl meets Desperate Housewives, but in the age of social media influencing. One particular look caught my attention in the first episode: the pinstriped, pink wrap-front top and brown monogrammed Fendi miniskirt worn by one of the teens, Allegra (Amelia Gray), during a choir performance at the school. My knowledge of the fashion of 15-year-old girls is limited, but the outfit seems intentionally dated – it immediately reminded me of 2004’s Mean Girls and you could imagine Allegra slotting in with the Plastics in the canteen every Wednesday. It seemed to communicate that the show was happy to wear its references on its sleeve and honour its cultural lineage of dark, privileged and toxic queen bees and queen-bee wannabes. Pink has always been the colour of that uniform. Matt Remick, Seth Rogen’s perpetually harried head of the fictional Continental Studios, in Apple’s terrific film-industry satire The Studio, is a man who never seems to be lacking a fine glazing of sweat. Somehow though, as Remick lurches from indignity to catastrophe to however you’d classify accidentally getting the CEO of your parent company face-meltingly high before a crucial upfronts presentation, his attire stays unruffled. , Remick’s dynamite collection of wide-lapel Italian suits, often in warm ochres, turmerics and mahoganys, hints at the golden age-era Hollywood he desperately wants his flatlining studio to evoke; a world away from the gilet-wearing tech bros that control cinema in 2025. However stressful and cringe-inducing events might become in The Studio, there’s always a dash of old-mogul glamour to make things go down easy. Some might think of Slow Horses’ Jackson Lamb (played by Gary Oldman) and recall farts and liberal swearing. But it’s the mac for me. A clever update on the one that Peter Falk wore as Columbo, it gives the same maverick genius vibe. The rest of the outfit only adds to the mood – loosened tie, slight paunch, seedy 70s glasses and hair in need of a seriously good wash. Partially embodying the outcast energy of Slough House, a grimy, damp office building in east London, but also with a disgustingly (enviable?) zero-fucks-given attitude. Here is a hero for our times. Let’s hope season six doesn’t mess with the outfit – but does give the formula a bit of a glow-up. Never mind the giant Gucci sunhat worn by Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), or the coordinated swimwear of Kate (Leslie Bibb), for me it was Rick’s collection of naff holiday-ready shirts that won the third season of When we first meet Rick (played by Walton Goggins), he’s wearing an apparently “Mexico”-themed shirt covered with bullfighting and folk-dancing motifs. It’s unbuttoned to the navel and teamed with khaki cargo trousers, black leather toe-wrap sandals, Wayfarer sunglasses and a gold chain with a tiger’s eye pendant. Should I be disgusted by this look? Absolutely. He’s basically a walking red flag who glares at his much younger girlfriend, Chelsea, played by Aimee Lou Wood, as she bangs on about how they are soulmates. But for some reason that I’m sure a therapist would have a hoot unpacking, I unashamedly fancy Rick. These shirts are even dodgier than his behaviour – remember when he casually mentioned he wasn’t allowed to enter Australia? They are decorated with cranes and spiky greenery, Hawaiian-esque palm prints, orange swirls and elephants. The saccharine patterns and motifs jar with his moody, mean and hot-headed persona but somehow it all just makes him even more alluring. Would I advise a man to buy a similar shirt for their next holiday? Please god no. They work on Rick, and Rick alone. Thankfully, the internet has reassured me that I am not alone in thinking the greasy-haired grump and his crass collection is hot. What can I say guys, fashion is fickle. Tuning into Amandaland earlier this year, I found myself watching the eponymous lead as much for her outfits as for her narcissistic unravelling. Her style is prim, polished and deeply impractical – which seems entirely the point. This is a woman who wears an all-cream outfit with high-heeled boots to her son’s football match on a muddy field, topping it off with the team scarf as a gesture of maternal solidarity. One of the funniest moments comes when Amanda is forced to flyer for a kitchen and bathroom showroom company in a burgundy branded T-shirt. “My colour palette is very much spring-summer and this is autumn-winter,” she protests, horrified. When she spots her daughter walking down the street, she quickly swaps the tee for a white vest trimmed with black lace, all dignity restored. It’s a small gag, but it perfectly captures Amanda’s desperation to curate herself at all times. Her clean style is a fragile shield that slips whenever real life intrudes. And that’s what makes it work. If you’ve seen the journalistic killer thriller The Beast in Me, you’ve probably noticed its broad-stroke approach to character names (Aggie Wiggs just trips off the tongue), the absurdly big houses (never has an upstate broken-pipe-dream of a mansion felt so dingy), and Nile Jarvis’s over-dyed hair. But the standout “set piece” is Aggie’s wardrobe. In almost every episode Aggie (Claire Danes) wears a button-down shirt, carrot pants and an ill-fitting man’s jacket, so tightly buttoned she can barely put her hands into the pockets – yet is compelled to stuff them in because, if you hadn’t guessed, Aggie is a woman in retreat from her own life. This is the sort of costume design I appreciate. All that Pulitzer money, all those Long Island boutiques, all those trips into Manhattan – and yet she can’t buy a jacket that fits! No matter that it’s damp all the time, a pair of clogs for her morning shuffle will do! In one early episode, she doesn’t even change out of her pyjamas for the whole day. The show is absurd. The plot is maddening. But in our Emily in Paris world, with its box-fresh costume changes, it’s heartening to see a woman so consumed by grief that she can barely dress herself. Grace’s customary look when on the beat in BBC’s Belfast police drama Blue Lights? A cap and furrowed brow. But outside the bottle-green of her PSNI uniform, our blonde-bobbed moral crusader morphs from public authority figure to understated power dresser. She wears lots of shirts. At home she wears a silk with the sleeves rolled up – structured, but a dusty pink with a scalloped collar for a soft, feminine twist. In another scene she gives younger colleague Annie advice in a blue-and-white-striped button-down. Grace (Siân Brooke) usually teams her shirts with high-waisted, wide-legged trousers. Hands in pockets, she’s giving Katharine Hepburn energy. And, as a millennial in her 30s, you’d have to prise that French tuck from Grace’s cold, dead waist (v relatable). Other times, she’s rocking knits. A homely, ribbed cardigan when in pastoral care mode; wrapped up against the sea breeze in a grey chunky fisherman’s sweater underneath a navy wool peacoat. Practical but stylish, sensible but sophisticated. But Grace is not afraid of colour or embellishment; she finally snogged Stevie while wearing a burnt orange double-breasted bouclé car coat. A bold look for a bold moment. Did she wear a Canadian tuxedo to a party in Belfast? Sure. But I will always stick up for double denim, and it’s not an arrestable offence. Grace may only be a rookie , but she’s holding her own next to Hercule Poirot and Jane Tennison in the style stakes. It’s a depressing time to be watching a show about the operatically extravagant lives of the 0.000001%, but Loot – at least for its first two seasons – is an absolute joy. Succession this is not. The fun being had with billionaire-mocking in this Apple TV+ show is exemplified in Molly’s wardrobe. The cuckquean, “nouveau riche”, , insensitive, ridiculous character is played with glee and comedic prowess by Maya Rudolph. Her dogs are called Mary-Kate and Ashley, and her clothes have the confidence of someone who was recently awarded $87bn in a divorce settlement. They are full of wild joy, vivid colour and fabrics – silks, satins, feathers and ostrich – fit only for a life with easy access to a fleet of rainbow-coloured sports cars. Molly turns up to her first day of work at the philanthropic foundation she didn’t know she owned wearing the same style of pink satin Peter Pilotto suit that Beyoncé wore in her . She wears a Vampire’s Wife dress the costume designer described as “the colour of money”, enough matching La DoubleJ to fill all the Ferraris of Milan and an embarrassment of luxury labels: Gucci, Lanvin, Taller Marmo, The Row. Patterns blare, feathers hoot and ruffles honk; this is 2025-era Boom Boom, not informed by the Wall Street extravagance of the 1980s but by the Silicon Valley AI dollar. It’s an orchestrated, brash and excessive look that feels quite panto, in a Bel-Air kind of way. It is, categorically, not the sort of thing I would ever wear. But in this context, where fictional billionaires leverage fictional sway with fictional money, it makes utter sense, and I salute it.",Jess Cartner-Morley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/26/like-kafka-by-way-of-pedro-almodovar-10-debut-novels-to-look-out-for-in-2026,‘Like Kafka by way of Pedro Almodóvar’: 10 debut novels to look out for in 2026,2025-12-26T07:00:03.000Z,"A Pulitzer finalist is among the first-time novelists, in tales of love, a surreal prison, teen murder and a tradwife An affecting tale of loneliness and love in Chauhan’s home town of Leicester, Belgrave Road tells the story of Mira, newly arrived in the UK from India following an arranged marriage, and Tahliil, a Somali cleaner who becomes her lunch partner, and her escape. By day, Chauhan is a finance lawyer; his debut novel follows his shortlisting in last year’s BBC short story competition. The Pakistani-American writer’s 2009 story collection, In Other Rooms, Other Wonders, was a Pulitzer finalist. Like his debut, hHis first novel is set in Pakistan, moving between bustling cities and agricultural estates, interrogating the country’s class dynamics through an epic portrait spanning six decades. , this 70s-set novel is one of the buzziest debuts of 2026. Jean is sent to boarding school Compton Manor – “aka House of Nutters” – to curb bad behaviour. He is an outsider, a Jewish scholarship boy surrounded by the children of heiresses, but an unlikely connection with a fellow student, Tom, promises to upend, and enrich, his life. Described by Monica Ali as the best debut she’s read “in a very long time”, Sabit’s novel, which took 10 years to complete, is told through dozens of voices surrounding the Sharaf family, who arrived in the US as refugees from Afghanistan in the late 90s. After teenager Zorah Sharaf is found dead in mysterious circumstances, the jury of characters gives their perspectives on what really happened. A clever debut probing the American dream and a clash of cultures. Dilara, an exile from Turkey living in Italy, plans a bathroom renovation so her elderly father can move in with her. Yet, when the builders leave, she realises something has gone seriously wrong: instead of a bathroom, there is now a cell, modelled after Istanbul’s Silivri mega-prison. This surreal novel of migration and memory, described as “like Kafka by way of Pedro Almodóvar” by the Booker-shortlisted author Avni Doshi, follows Orhan’s celebrated 2023 story collection. Tomaski’s’s has said that “with the publication of this book, 30 years of relentless, excruciating failure come to an end”. Her debut takes the form of a house tour around Thornwalk, the gothic mansion home to the last of the eccentric Wynford Gilberts, and soon to be handed over to a luxury hotel chain. Our tour guide, Maximus, narrates the family’s turbulent history through the house’s many quirks. Natalie is a tradwife influencer – posting content of her perfect children along with tutorials for homemade orange juice and soap from her 500-acre farm – and totally insufferable at that. Soon, she is ripped from her life, waking up in 1805, where the aestheticised gender roles she has espoused become much more real. This has already been optioned for film, with Anne Hathaway set to star and produce. Barton is responsible for bringing one of the biggest books of recent years to UK audiences, having translated from Japanese. In her own first novel, a woman takes a job as a translator for a games company in Frankfurt and soon becomes fixated on a man she spots on the tram. McKenzie-Goddard, who worked in publishing for almost a decade and co-founded the pop-culture podcast Don’t Alert the Stans, has written a multigenerational story of a British-Bajan family impacted by the Windrush scandal. In 1961, Lucinda travels from Barbados to England in search of her son’s father, Clarence. Decades later, a Home Office letter threatens her deportation. Calder’s first published fiction came under Sally Rooney’s editorship of the literary magazine Stinging Fly. Arriving Hthree years after his acclaimed story collection Reward System, his debut novel follows the relationship between 35-year-old Chuck, a copywriter freshly broken up with his fiancee, and the much younger Joey, a barista and aspiring poet.

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/26/the-10-best-jazz-albums-of-2025,The 10 best jazz albums of 2025,2025-12-26T07:00:02.000Z,"Jakob Bro’s Bill Frisell collaboration finally saw the light, Cécile McLorin Salvant drew on her teenage pop memories and Anthony Braxton looked back to 1985 UK saxophonist, composer and bandleader Tom Smith was dropping clues to his distinctively contemporary take on jazz traditions as a BBC Young Musician of the Year finalist in 2014 and 2016, and later as a leader of groups including the sax trio Gecko and the LGBTQI+ ensemble Queertet. But his powerful big band’s 2025 release, A Year in the Life, unveiled how exultantly Smith’s writing mingles orchestral influences from Maria Schneider and Carla Bley with slamming groovers from the big-band swing era, and a deep grasp of bebop chordal acrobatics, with raw and metallic guitar interventions thrown in. Arboresque is the Artemis collective’s third and best release for the Blue Note label, evolved from an ensemble formed for International Women’s Day in 2016 by the acclaimed Canadian pianist and composer Renee Rosnes. All five members compose; standouts include saxist Nicole Glover’s ethereal Petrichor for its theme and her tenor improv, and trumpeter Ingrid Jensen’s snappy Sights Unseen with its vivacious post-bop dialogue with Rosnes. There are typically evocative Rosnes arrangements of her former employer Wayne Shorter’s Footprints, and the standard What the World Needs Now is Love. Cliche-free individuality and congenial collective spirit radiantly combined. Danish guitarist Jakob Bro is an undisguised admirer of Bill Frisell, but also of the unique melodic imagination of legendary Birth of the Cool alto saxophonist Lee Konitz. In 2014, ECM recorded this mini-masterpiece with Bro, an 86-year-old Konitz, and an avant-jazz supergroup of Frisell, pianist Jason Moran, bassist Thomas Morgan and former Cecil Taylor drummer Andrew Cyrille – and then unaccountably sat on it. This belated release reveals softly chiming harmonies and songlike waltzes for the inimitable Konitz to gleam and breathe through, alongside Cyrille’s and Morgan’s free-floating conceptions of swing, and the minimalist, interwoven delicacies of two sound-painting contemporary guitar masters. Keyboardist Pat Thomas has been an idiomatically diverse creative maverick in UK jazz and improv for over three decades, and this two-album set features his أحمد [Ahmed] quartet’s stormily percussive, sonically abstract work, dedicated to sometime Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, a pioneering merger of jazz and Middle Eastern music. Saxophonist Seymour Wright (an awesome inheritor of the methods of Albert Ayler and Evan Parker) and bassist Joel Grip often entwine raw multiphonics with melodious bowed sounds, while Thomas’s sometimes Cecil Taylor-esque chording and drummer Antonin Gerbal’s racing uptempo patterns rock between boiling free-jazz squalls and rattling folk-dances, on a session of fearless but infectiously compelling free jazz. Twelve originals and one quirky cover, first created alone with a computer by the French/Haitian/US vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant, and then studio-layered with some longtime vocal and instrumental partners. Salvant draws on teenage pop memories, on folk and classical music, and the rich jazz life of her years in France. Fragile song-lines drift over drum loops, sleek jazz pianist Sullivan Fortner drives old-school swingers, while genre-spanning vocal partners June McDoom and Kate Davis join hauntingly empathic harmonies. What Does Blue Mean to You?, inspired by Toni Morrison’s Beloved, is the standout of a memorably bold and personal venture. The Malaysia-born, New York-based Australian bassist and composer Linda May Han Oh has long played for stars (Vijay Iyer and Pat Metheny among them); her own ventures have been few, but special. Strange Heavens revisits the partnership first launched in 2009 with Miles-influenced but lyrically inimitable trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire. The pair are joined here by Tyshawn Sorey, one of the great drummer-composers – and improvisational listeners – in contemporary music. Whisper-quiet melodies blossom out of bass caresses and Sorey’s spacey rimshots, Miles-like trumpet improv glides over hip-hoppish grooves, and Geri Allen’s Skin and Melba Liston’s Just Waiting get respectfully startling reinventions. US improvising saxophone master Joshua Redman’s 2023 debut for Blue Note (three decades after his spectacular 1993 emergence) was atypically and unsuitably focused on covers and vocals. But this year’s release features one vocal, an all-original repertoire and a new road band, and acclaimed Chilean saxophonist Melissa Aldana and 19-year-old west coast trumpeter Skylar Tang guesting. Both of them improvise with Redman as if they were soulmates, the ballad Borrowed Eyes develops exquisitely in spacey Redman whispers against softly plucked bass sounds, and the captivatingly ghostly voice of Gabrielle Cavassa shares a spellbinding vocal/tenor sax exchange on the closing Era’s End. The influence of the now 80-year-old Anthony Braxton, one of the great instrumental and conceptual jazz and new-music pioneers, has spanned music from free-improv to symphonies and operas. But his small jazz groups have often best showcased his multi-reeds virtuosity and the imagination that drives it. These live recordings from Braxton’s superb 1985 quartet tour of the UK feature headlong avant-bebop storms, free-collective passages, captivating warm-ups on standard songs, and the power and precision of pianist Marilyn Crispell, bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Gerry Hemingway. The cassette-recorded audio is understandably patchy, but the sense of being present at its creation is vivid. About Ghosts expands New York guitarist/composer Mary Halvorson’s Amaryllis ensemble who partnered with her on 2024’s acclaimed Cloudward release. They are augmented here by two soulful saxophonists in altoist Immanuel Wilkins, and tenorist Brian Settles, whose arrival swells the surprises that Halvorson’s pieces constantly play with. Full of Neon’s march-like pulse and rich ensemble harmonies are squawked at by indignant horn exclamations, taut guitar figures mix with whooping alto improv on Carved From, and beboppish outbursts travel so fast as to sound hyper-compressed. Halvorson has said she loves singer-songwriter Robert Wyatt’s music for blending “the weird with the beautiful”. She certainly knows all about how that’s done. The brilliant German pianist/composer Michael Wollny’s 10-year-old group with David Bowie Blackstar bassist Tim Lefebvre, and genre-busting drummer Eric Schaefer, goes from strength to strength. Living Ghosts is a live recording featuring the group’s favoured eschewal of setlists or arrangements, letting go to what the pianist has called “seances where the ghosts of the trio’s songbook visit us at their will”. Alban Berg and Paul Hindemith miniatures turn into rock-powered stomps or bass-walking bebop, swing turns into raw improv, Nick Cave’s Hand of God becomes Guillaume de Machaut’s Lasse! But governing it all is what types of music have in common, not what divides them.",John Fordham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sergei Udaltsov, the leader of the Left Front movement that opposes Putin and is affiliated with the Communist party, was arrested last year. According to the Russian independent news site Mediazona, the charges against him stem from an article Udaltsov posted online in support of another group of Russian activists accused of forming a terrorist organization. Those activists were convicted earlier this month and handed sentences ranging from 16 to 22 years in prison. Udaltsov has rejected the charges against him as fabricated. On Thursday, he denounced the verdict as “shameful” and said he was going on a hunger strike, Mediazona reported. According to the court ruling, the activist will be serving his sentence in a maximum security penal colony. Udaltsov was a prominent opposition figure during the 2011-12 mass protests in Russia, triggered by reports of widespread rigging of a parliamentary election. In February 2012, he took part in a meeting that the then president, Dmitry Medvedev, held with various opposition figures. Russian authorities have ramped up their crackdown on dissent and free speech after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine, relentlessly targeting rights groups, independent media, members of civil society organizations, LGBTQ+ activists and some religious groups. Hundreds of people have been jailed and thousands of others have fled the country. In December 2023, a Moscow court sentenced Udaltsov to 40 hours of compulsory labor for violating procedures relating to organizing a rally after he was detained on Red Square, where he tried to unfurl a flag with the image of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, according to Russia’s state news agency, Tass. Udaltsov was previously imprisoned in 2014 and sentenced to 4.5 years on charges related to his role in organizing a 2012 demonstration against Putin that turned turbulent. He was released in 2017.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now this culture must be future-proofed from the forces of globalisation n the face of it, British culture looks doomed. Our music industry is now borderline untenable, with grassroots venues shuttering at speed (125 in 2023 alone) and artists unable to afford to play the few that are left; touring has become a loss leader that even established acts must subsidise with other work. Meanwhile, streaming has gutted the value of recorded music, leading to industry contraction at the highest level: earlier this year the UK divisions of Warners and Atlantic – two of our biggest record labels – were effectively subsumed into the US business. In comedy, the Edinburgh fringe – the crucible of modern British standup, sketch and sitcom – is in existential crisis thanks to a dearth of sponsorship and prohibitively high costs for performers. Our film industry is at this point almost totally reliant on (dwindling) US funds; while Britain remains a popular filming destination due to tax breaks and appealing locations, the vast majority of the productions made here ultimately generate American profits. As the BBC, bedrock of our cultural life, lurches from crisis to crisis, the TV industry at large has been ruinously compromised by broadcasters’ inability to pay for programming due to advertising cuts and ballooning costs. Like film, it has become dependent on international investment – to the extent that many are concerned that we’ve lost the ability to make programmes exclusively for British audiences. Shows that cannot attract foreign money rely on goodwill, with directors, writers and stars of flagship dramas taking significant pay cuts just to get them made (see: the second instalment of the double-Bafta-winning Wolf Hall). Unlike US-based streamers, we are incapable of converting viewership into profit: ripped-from-the-headlines drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office attracted an audience of more than 13 million and still lost around £1m, something ITV boss Kevin Lygo attributed to its lack of sales in other territories. How on earth do we sustain an uncompromising, idiosyncratic arts sector in these circumstances? One result of the globalisation of entertainment is that success is now judged by the number of nationally indistinct eyeballs or eardrums culture can attract. As a small island, we are surely destined to matter less and less. Except something strange has happened. Amid this catastrophe, British culture is booming. Not only are we dominating the global zeitgeist, but we’re doing so with art that reckons with our heritage and sensibility in unprecedentedly thrilling and nuanced ways. Look at it all – from the viral trends that capture the British psyche like never before to the music, TV and films that grapple with the complex, often contradictory British identity – and tell me we haven’t found ourselves in a golden age. I Used to Live in England is a very British love letter to Britain. By an American. “I used to shop at Tesco’s and buy meal deals,” drawls musician Frankie Beanie, who released the track in June under his Supermodel moniker. “I used to say ‘Go Tesco’s’ instead of ‘Go to Tesco’s’,” he brags before referencing Wetherspoons, his familiarity with UK garage (“So now I can be the guy in LA that says ”) and £65 national rail journeys. Beanie isn’t the only yank bypassing the tired tropes – afternoon tea, bad teeth, the word “guv’nor” – to celebrate the real hallmarks of British life. Following 2024’s Britishcore trend, in which TikTok users from around the world embraced our quintessential texts (Trainspotting), institutions (Greggs) and figures (Gemma Collins), this year has seen a boom in all-round Anglophilia from across the pond: root causes include a romanticised perception of the UK as a sanctuary from Trump’s America and an unprecedented exposure to the nuances of the British sensibility via social media. “I love England so much,” declared Olivia Rodrigo during her Glastonbury headline set, citing Colin the Caterpillar, having a judgment-free pint at noon and English men, a reference to her current squeeze, the actor Louis Partridge. The pair’s transatlantic coupledom forms a key part of the “British boyfriend” trend, fuelled by the surfeit of young British actors dominating Hollywood, that has made UK men an aspirational accessory. Elsewhere, there’s been a global boom in popularity for the British content creators whose clownish provocation “feels equal parts Benny Hill, You’ve Been Framed, and Nil By Mouth”, as per Clive Martin, author of an article published by Vice in August titled How The World Fell in Love With a Summer of British Chaos. It seems like genuine familiarity with the UK has become a weird form of cultural capital: when New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was asked about his listening habits, he waxed lyrical about the Arseblog Arsecast podcast and an extended version of One Pound Fish, a viral 2012 song by an east London market trader who ended up on The X Factor. Clearly there’s a novelty factor to this internet craze iteration of Cool Britainnia 2.0. Yet there’s substance, too: our wry fetishisation of mundanity and slightly crap small pleasures is finally being understood on a global scale. Meanwhile, in the more conventional artistic sphere, a far more profound reflection of Britishness is all the rage. Take pop music. In the 2010s, the British artists that enjoyed enormous global success: Adele, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay pedalled fairly beige fare that had little to say about this country. Fast-forward to now: for two summers on the trot we’ve been responsible for the transatlantic musical zeitgeist: this year, the Oasis reunion; last year, Charli xcx’s Brat. (The latter’s influence continued well into 2025, partly thanks to a belated and horribly misguided .) Both are quintessentially British in myriad ways. Oasis have, of course, been national mascots for more than 30 years: their combination of lairy terrace banter, mordant Mancunian wit, knowingly ludicrous braggadocio and Beatles nostalgia was a shortcut to the hearts of a population encouraged to romanticise the everyday, the past and the concept of having a laugh. Brat, meanwhile, connected thanks to more up-to-date British references: happy hardcore, UK garage, dubstep. Yet at its root is an ironic, ideas-y British art school sensibility, whose current figurehead happens to be Charli’s close collaborator AG Cook, a Goldsmiths graduate who helped birthed hyperpop – the only genuinely new musical subgenre in recent memory – via his irreverent satire of artifice, consumerism, tech and good taste. Also like Oasis, Brat channelled a fuck-it candour and sardonic megalomania, this time in the guise of a privately educated party girl. In fact, that chaotic, gobby yet meticulously droll side of our national character was all over pop: from Lily Allen’s evisceratingly honest yet acerbically funny West End Girl to Lola Young’s expletive-laden Messy (which topped the charts in January) to ex-Little Mixer Jade’s debut album That’s Showbiz Baby! (sample lyric: “I am the it girl / I am the shit girl”). They share a vibe with Amelia Dimoldenberg, whose YouTube series Chicken Shop Date fuses social awkwardness, sandpaper-dry wit and the less salubrious end of the UK high street into a vision of peak Britishness that’s been lapped up in the US; she is currently the Oscars red carpet correspondent. If Charli’s RP-accented electropop was very us, then Kent-raised PinkPantheress’s melancholic version might be even more so. Since debuting on TikTok in 2020, the 24-year-old’s rise has been brisk (the social media platform’s tendency to serve niche UK content to global audiences results in chicken-and-egg-style popularity, see also: #Britishcore): this year she was nominated for the Mercury prize and two Grammys. She, too, leans on an overtly British nostalgia, overlaying drum’n’bass, jungle and big beat samples with evocatively desolate vocals that telegraph rain-lashed woe. PinkPantheress’ USP in the US may be mining this underheard musical history in an appealing accent, but she’s also digging deep into the feeling of Britishness. On the moodboard, she once told Rolling Stone, is “hope and lost hope”, the colour grey, Skins, “having a dirty kind of feeling” and the Streets, particularly Mike Skinner’s ability to evoke the sense that “life is so shit”. It was a take delivered, according to the interviewer, in that “distinctly British way we have of delighting in our own misery”. This was also the year distinctively British rap properly crossed the pond thanks to Central Cee, whose debut Can’t Rush Greatness became the first ever UK rap album to enter the Billboard top 10, and did so with a grounding in UK drill and shout-outs for Sports Direct, the Uxbridge Road and the Vauxhall Astra. Having previously aligned himself closely with US R&B, in August Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes released Essex Honey, an album suffused in pained nostalgia for his Ilford childhood whose “primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy”, wrote the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis. In cinema, Tim Key and Tom Basden’s exquisitely sad The Ballad of Wallis Island – one of the greatest films this country has ever produced, according to Richard Curtis – proved an unlikely international hit while remaining, in Basden’s view “very British”: set amid blustery Welsh coastline, its emotional palette was dominated by repressed grief sublimated into awkward banter and a yearning for the past; references included Monster Munch, Gideon Coe and Harold Shipman. Faced with acclaim on the US festival circuit, Key did his national self-deprecation duty and wrested the prospect of failure from success by wondering if he’d accidentally made a film that only worked in America. Another ridiculously British film, Danny Boyle’s 28 Years Later, took in more than $150m worldwide. Boyle’s film was a kitchen sink drama – fry-ups and familial dysfunction in a two-up-two-down – in the guise of a zombie film that opened with an old VHS of the Teletubbies and crescendoed with the appearance of a Clockwork Orange-style gang paying sartorial tribute to Jimmy Savile. It was also an allegory for post-Brexit Britain: the community at its core are isolationists who channel nostalgic comfort via a vision of England that takes in Arthurian romance, the postwar village hall and pint-based ribaldry. If 28 Years Later was a sour, surreal yet beautiful paean to this country’s past, – the second-most popular programme in Netflix history – was its nightmarishly future-facing counterpart. Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham’s six-time Emmy-winning tale of a 13-year-old accused of murder was the kind of provocative social-issues television that used to be our stock-in-trade – only none of them could boast 142million views. Painstakingly realistic – the police station scenes were eerily reminiscent of Channel 4’s obs-doc 24 Hours in Police Custody (Graham has admitted to being “obsessed” with the series) – it eventually descended into a chillingly ordinary domestic drama that recalled Mike Leigh at his most devastating. Elsewhere, Apple TV’s runaway hit Slow Horses – built on a bedrock of failure and flatulence and set in a recognisably depressing recreation of the capital – returned for a fifth series. Also returning, for a second outing, was Such Brave Girls, whose combination of stifling suburbia and extreme gallows humour is deeply entrenched in a dark British comic sensibility (the New York Times drew parallels with Peep Show, Pulling and Fleabag), despite being backed by influential US production powerhouse A24. All capture the spirit of UK life infinitely more accurately than The Crown or The Great British Bake Off or Ted Lasso – but not every depiction of Britain on screen has been so bleak. Industry, a HBO-BBC co-production most popular in the US, is possibly the most cool and sophisticated drama ever made about Britain: segueing from trading floor to dodgy boozer to gentlemen’s club to country cottage, creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay have managed to infuse their study of the black box power structures at the heart of UK society with gobsmacking drama and biting satire. Perhaps the panic about British culture dying out is premature. Or perhaps the disastrous effects are still to come. Either way, the most startling thing about this new age in which we are obligated to perform Britishness to the rest of the world is how creatively and authentically it is being done – and how well it is going down. So why can’t we use this present high to help lift our creative industries out of dire straits? In January, David Lammy announced a “soft power” taskforce, designed to turn our cultural achievements into benefits for the country, noting that despite our successes “we have not taken a sufficiently strategic approach to these huge assets”. There has never been a better time to monetise the global appetite for British culture, but 12 months later we’re still waiting for a plan of action. Some people do have actual ideas: Wolf Alice guitarist Joff Oddie has been among those petitioning for the introduction of a £1 ticket levy on arena gigs, with proceeds going to smaller venues (the policy was adopted earlier this year, albeit only on a voluntary basis). Even if we have shortsightedly allowed US tech companies to annex our TV industry, it’s not too late to claw back some cash: director Peter Kosminsky (Wolf Hall, The Undeclared War) is advocating for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the money raised going towards a British cultural fund. In September, prolific screenwriter Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders, A Thousand Blows, the first film in the newly Amazon-owned James Bond franchise) told the Times that the answer to our current woes might be “creative nationalism”. The phrase may make you flinch – especially after a summer in which the St George’s Cross, long weaponised by the far-right, was displayed around the country as part of a nebulous patriotic campaign. Yet some strain of nationalism – in the autonomy and independence sense – may be necessary if we don’t want our popular culture to be permanently dependent on the whims of foreign conglomerates. (Disney’s decision to discard its underperforming Doctor Who reboot like an old snot rag should serve as a warning.) Either way, Knight’s outlook didn’t seem particularly exclusionary or tub-thumping: his version of Britishness – “a cross between Dad’s Army and SAS Rogue Heroes” – was based around rain, cold and our awareness “of our own absurdities”. The problem with creative nationalism might just be that: we are so in love with our failures and flaws that capitalising on success just isn’t a very British thing to do. If our cultural sensibility is anti-boosterish – rooted in self-deprecation, repression, chaos, irreverence and disappointment – perhaps we operate best on the back foot. The future is uncertain, but one thing isn’t: as 2025 comes to a close, British culture finds itself in a very British place.",Rachel Aroesti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/26/best-worst-gifts-guardian-readers,‘A bat’s head’: the best and worst gifts 11 people have ever received,2025-12-26T17:00:13.000Z,"Can we learn anything from the experiences of these Guardian readers? Exchanging gifts is delightful. It can also be fraught. How do you choose something the receiver will enjoy or find meaningful? And must you act pleased if you receive a tub of anti-cellulite cream? Eleven Guardian readers shared the best and worst gifts they have ever received. Can we learn anything from their experiences? Perhaps not: “Don’t just give something that appeals to you,” writes one, and “Always gift something you want,” writes another. No wonder so many of us have a hard time figuring it out. : My husband took me on a cruise up the Nile river for my birthday. It was the trip of a lifetime. : One winter evening at college, a fellow student came up to me and declared: “This is for you. It’s a bat’s head.” It was a very heavy box. He had never expressed romantic interest in me before, and I was so surprised I said nothing. It was cold, so I hurried back to my dorm room. I had feared it was an anatomical specimen, but what I found was a mass of hardened plaster of paris. My roommate and I went to the dumpster and dropped it in. : When my son was 13, he started working as a paper boy in the afternoon, six days a week. My present from him that year was a food processor, which I could not afford to buy myself as a single, low-income mother. : A male colleague gave me Lancôme anti-cellulite cream. : My parents weren’t gift givers. Mostly they just didn’t buy anything, but for Christmas when I was 10, they bought me a new bike, and a trip to Germany to visit a friend by myself. I thought this was incredible. In hindsight, now that I have kids, I think maybe they were just trying to get rid of me for a break. : When I was 17, my mum’s friend bought me cellulite-reducing tights. : My daughter surprised me with a trip to Kauai, Hawaii. The trip was magical. We watched giant sea turtles coming up on the beach and sunset to rest. : Silicone ice cube trays. The giver said he saw me struggling with a regular tray. I thought it was a strange thing to be considered a gift. It also smelled bad. : As a massive Tim Curry fan, I was surprised to find one of my former colleagues knew and liked his work. She gave me a mug printed with his most prominent characters. I’m too scared to use it. It’s special. : The drawback of being a Tim Curry aficionado is that he’s in a lot of films of doubtful quality. I think the worst is Four Dogs Playing Poker. My dad gave it to me for Christmas. I regifted it to an unsuspecting frenemy. : Ruby earrings from my soon-to-be second husband. : A vacuum cleaner which was the beginning of an eventual divorce. : My then-guru gave me a beautiful, large bronze Quan Yin, seated on a dragon. : One year, my friend gave me an ugly wooden carved gnome face. She loved and collected them. I was horrified. It felt evil! I’d been invited to a new year’s fire ritual, and it immediately went into the flames. : Rubber floor mats for my first car, a Saab 900S. I lived in Chicago and needed to protect the car’s carpet. It was the only thing I wanted and I was so happy to get it. . Who needs a singing fish on a wall plaque? : I have 30 years of experience making quilts. One Christmas, my mom bought me a Walmart quilt. I’ve never figured out why. : I used to work for a homeless charity, and one of my responsibilities was to supervise a workshop where people could learn woodworking skills. It had been a difficult year with a funding crisis looming. Out of the blue, the trainees presented me with a beautiful wooden candle box, crafted from cherry wood. It’s still in use, and it holds red candles for my advent wreath. : I received a large, fancy box of assorted nuts. I have a severe nut allergy, which most people are aware of. Or so I thought. : This will probably sound like many people’s idea of a “worst” gift, but my husband got me two dozen new tea towels. We use them for cloth napkins and all sorts of household tasks. Getting more was thoughtful, and a sign my husband was listening to what I wanted rather than buying me something more conventional that I’m supposed to want.",Madeleine Aggeler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/27/a-lot-of-men-dont-open-up-kidwild-the-uk-rapper-unafraid-to-bare-his-soul,"‘A lot of men don’t open up’: Kidwild, the UK rapper unafraid to bare his soul",2025-12-27T08:00:33.000Z,"As a child he performed in the West End and appeared in a Stormzy video. But after his early music career faltered, he began to write about his troubled childhood – and hit a nerve It’s a measure of how quickly Keaton Edmund, AKA Kidwild, has speed-run his way through a performing arts career that the rapper describes himself as being in the “comeback part of my life” at age 20. As a child he was acting opposite Beverley Knight in The Bodyguard in the West End and toured the production around China. He had a main role in four seasons of CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson and appeared on Casualty. You can see him dancing in the video to Stormzy’s 2017 single Vossi Bop, a baby-faced scamp swinging a baseball bat into the camera lens. It all made him grow up fast. “I was spending bare time alone, bare time with older people. So I just started seeing life for what it is. You get time to sit with your thoughts.” he ordered a microphone and began crafting rap songs of his own. Half a decade on, he now has millions of listeners drawn to his candid storytelling about his life’s struggles. But not until after a false start. he had signed to major label Atlantic Records – so young that his mum had to chaperone him to the signing. But after Edmund had released two tracks, the person who signed him left, and he was left in limbo. “For everything to just go cold, you start second-guessing yourself,” he says, speaking with expansive, gentle gestures on a Guardian office sofa, his features still almost as boyish as in that Stormzy video. “It’s kind of degrading, because you’re meant to be the next star, as they said, and then you just exist.” After a third track “didn’t live up to their expectation – I don’t know what their expectation was”, he was dropped. But that newfound freedom left him feeling “like I came out of jail”. He felt charged up at the prospect of making a career on his own. When his self-released track Indecisive started gaining traction in October 2024 – it’s since been streamed 29m times on Spotify – he was visiting family in St Lucia. “Everything I ever wanted was happening, and I’m just sitting at my grandma’s house in the village.” He flew home, then a day later he went to the studio and “in a flow state” wrote the hook to Redemption – one of the biggest British rap tracks of 2025. “How can I stop when I come this far? / I smile outside, deep down I’m scarred”, he rapped. Later in the year, on superb JBee collaboration If I Lose, he tells a lover: “I just want you to hold me.” Vulnerability has soared in rap over the last decade, but Kidwild is particularly soul-baring over his atmospheric, drill-adjacent beats. Is it taboo for men to be so open with their emotions? “It’s true – you see it in the suicide rates in men compared to women,” he says. “A lot of men don’t open up. With songs where I’m quite vulnerable, people message me and say: I relate to this so much. If they are one of them people who don’t like to speak on their emotions, at least they have Kidwild to relate to.” The most potent of these tracks is his recent single Forgive Me, about his relationship with his father who was imprisoned for a number of years. “I was calling your phone, never got no reception / The only pic I got of us is me in Reception,” Kidwild raps, crestfallen. “I remember the first time I got a call from jail,” he says. “I didn’t want to speak. I said hi, and that was it, just gave my mum back the phone.” On the track he spits out: “Is it a crime if I say I’m glad he got sentenced?” But after five years of no contact, they are beginning to reconcile. “When we speak about it now, I laugh because it’s like, now that I’m older, I understand life more. I see why I was angry.” A forthcoming mixtape is “a chance to talk my truth” and chart his difficult youth. “A lot of music now, there’s not much topic, it’s just like …” Vibes? “Vibes, yeah – which is good! I like vibes music. But I wanted to add something different, get in depth.”",Ben Beaumont-Thomas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/26/bari-weiss-60-minutes-el-salvador-prison,Bari Weiss defends decision to pull 60 Minutes episode on El Salvador prison,2025-12-26T17:55:20.000Z,"CBS News editor-in-chief argues in memo that network’s priority was ‘comprehensive and fair’ coverage CBS News’ editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, defended her decision to pull a 60 Minutes episode on allegations investigating a , arguing that the network’s priority was to ensure its coverage was “comprehensive and fair”. In the memo sent to staff on Christmas Eve, Weiss said news organizations needed to do more to win back the trust of the American public and vowed that “no amount of outrage” would “derail us”. “We are not out to score points with one side of the political spectrum or to win followers on social media,” according to the memo, signed by Weiss and other CBS News leadership and . “We are out to inform the American public and to get the story right.” The internal battle over the story exploded into public view after CBS announced the segment would not be a part of the show, despite extensive promotion. Weiss’s last-minute decision to hold the episode sparked outrage and charges of censorship amid Donald Trump’s second administration, though some generally aligned with the president have defended the move. In a private email sent to 60 Minutes correspondents that was subsequently made public, CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who spent weeks reporting the episode, called the decision a “political one”. In the memo to staff, Weiss acknowledged the uproar her decision had caused internally and externally – but she rejected the accusation that politics played a role in her determination to hold the segment. “Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week,” Weiss wrote. “And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.” Weiss has said she was concerned about the episode airing without a sufficient response from the . But Alfonsi said it had been “screened five times” as well as cleared by CBS attorneys along with its standards and practices department. She also said her team had unsuccessfully requested comment from the White House, the US state department, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Alfonsi wrote. The episode has since appeared online, after it was published by a streaming platform owned by Global TV, the network that has the rights to 60 Minutes in Canada. In it, Alfonsi visits the prison in El Salvador and interviews deportees who offered powerful testimony about torture and abuse inside the notorious prison where the Trump administration had sent more than 200 Venezuelan migrants from the US in what a federal judge recently ruled CBS’s decision to hold the episode comes amid a widening feud between the Trump administration and 60 Minutes – one of journalism’s most venerated institutions known for hard-hitting investigations. During the 2024 election, Trump declined to sit for an interview with 60 Minutes, then sued the network over how the show handled an interview with his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. In a highly controversial move, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, Earlier in December, Trump fumed on Truth Social that the network had treated him “far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before”. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” the Republican added. A week earlier, he assailed the show for an interview with his ally turned critic, the outgoing Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he called a “very poorly prepared Traitor”, and said of parent company Paramount: “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.” Weiss’s management of CBS has come under sharp scrutiny since she was by Paramount’s CEO, David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump ally and donor who is one of the world’s richest people. Paramount Weiss’s Free Press, the conservative-friendly publication she founded after leaving the New York Times as a columnist, in a reported $150m deal. and concern by CBS’s editorial staff while media watchdogs questioned Weiss’s qualifications to lead the storied news network and raised concerns about further media politicization. Weiss, who writer and media operator, has no experience working in broadcast television. Paramount is now waging an extraordinary hostile takeover bid to gain control of Discovery, which had reached a deal to sell its storied film and television properties to Netflix. Trump has made clear that he plans to be involved in the acquisition’s regulatory review process.",Lauren Gambino,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/27/podcasts-rush-to-video-turning-them-into-dreadful-listens,‘Painful to hear!’ How podcasts’ rush to video is turning them into dreadful listens,2025-12-27T09:00:34.000Z,"From Joe Marler’s visual-only stunts to the incomprehensible shuffling sounds Steven Bartlett recently subjected headphone users to, dodgy audio experiences are on the rise o understand where we are in the evolution of podcasting, the opening episode of Joe Marler Will See You Now is unexpectedly instructive. The podcast finds Marler, former rugby player and breakout star of The , impersonating a psychotherapist and subjecting guests to “totally unregulated psychological testing”. The mock-therapy conceit is hardly a new one, but on paper it still has the makings of a successful pod. fresh from ratings-busting TV triumph? Check. Fancy studio setup for the viewing crowd? Check. Weird visual stunts that will leave audio listeners baffled? Er … check? from the last 18 months has been the medium’s swift and unstoppable pivot to video. Where a podcast was previously defined as an audio recording available to stream online, it has since expanded to become an umbrella term taking in visual and audio content. The idea, at least in theory, is that audiences get to choose whether they watch or listen. But there are creeping signs that video is taking precedence, with audio considered to be secondary. Which brings us to Marler’s pod, the opening episode of which has its host in conversation with his fellow Celebrity Traitors contestant . Before becoming an actor, Mohammed worked as a magician, which is presumably why Marler gets him to perform a card trick. It’s not exactly riveting visual entertainment, but if you are listening, it’s impossible to know what’s going on. While Mohammed does attempt to explain the mechanics of the trick, there is no tension and no sense, for the listener, of the sleight of hand at the heart of it. Sillier still is a so-called trust exercise where Marler blindfolds Mohammed and pretends to shoot a paper cup off the top of his head using a crossbow (in fact he uses a child’s gun – which is something you just cannot tell from listening alone). Again, it’s not good in either medium, but listening to it is like eavesdropping on a stranger telling a funny story but missing the vital plot points. This is not an isolated case of a visualised podcast seemingly forgetting about its listeners. A recent episode of the all-conquering Diary of a CEO With , featuring insomnia expert Matthew Walker, saw Bartlett hand his interviewee a jar of gold coins to explain the concept of banking sleep before periods of stress. At no point was this visual aid described for the show’s listeners; instead, they just heard long pauses and incomprehensible shuffling sounds. Sometimes the problem isn’t visual explainers or gags but simply crappy sound quality. Early episodes of The Rest Is Football podcast, in which hosts Gary Lineker, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer sat around a coffee table wearing tiny clip-on mics, sounded as if they were broadcasting from deep inside a cave. The problem was subsequently fixed, but the fact that the series is set to broadcast daily on Netflix for next year’s World Cup says a lot about where its values lie. For podcast host and audio critic Miranda Sawyer, the problem is clear. “A podcast made by people who come from a telly, YouTube or Insta background prioritises video rather than audio, and the result can be painful to hear. I’ve heard shows where one or all of the participants are on Zoom and one cuts out, and there’s no editing to make it better to listen to.” Asked if she believes the focus on video content is coming at the expense of audio quality, she says: “I think it comes at the expense of both. A podcast that is made by people who prefer audio means you get a desultory effort when it comes to visuals: presenters sitting in front of a studio bookcase, on a sofa that makes them slump, with mics in an awkward position.” Much of the drive behind video content comes from its potential as a marketing tool for the show. Footage can easily be clipped up and shared on social media to help drive audience engagement and, where possible, generate news lines. Eleanor McDowall, audio documentary-maker and director of Falling Tree, the production company behind series including Half Life and Short Cuts, notes that “in the hyper-visual landscape of social media, it’s always been a struggle to share audio eye-catchingly”. She adds that she can understand the draw for networks in having celebrities talking in digestible clips, though, she says, “I do get depressed thinking that the funder is more concerned with the ease of advertising something as opposed to the value of the thing itself.” None of this is to say that beautifully produced audio podcasts are a thing of the past. This October saw the launch of Adrift, an Apple Original podcast telling the true story of the Robertson family, who were shipwrecked in the Pacific in the early 1970s. It’s an audio-only series that goes to great lengths to place the listener in the dinghy with the Robertsons using multilayered sound design. Audible’s all-star remake of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone also comes with a rich and detailed sound palette, replicating echoing footsteps on Hogwarts corridors and the whoosh of an owl coming in to land. There is, however, a certain type of podcast that is enamoured of studio furnishings, mood lighting and the celebrity in its midst, and which cares a lot less about the listener tuning in on headphones. Can McDowall see a time when audio and video split off again and become distinct mediums? “I hope so,” she replies. “The absence of images from radio and podcasting isn’t some failure of technology. These audio mediums have grown from a deep love of sound and its imaginative possibilities. When I hear people say the future of audio is essentially television, it makes me feel they never knew what was exciting about sound in the first place.” Judging from the speed at which visualised podcasts have taken hold, it’s clear that they are here to stay. Even so, the focus of major networks on eyeballs over ears overlooks not only the capacity of audio to spark the imagination but also its intrinsic convenience. One of the reasons I love audio pods is that they allow me to do other things while listening, such as walking the dog or cooking. For dedicated audiophiles, poor sound quality or content aimed primarily at viewers is unlikely to drive them to sit down and watch the visual version instead. They will simply switch off altogether.",Fiona Sturges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/17/beat-winter-blues-advice-socialising-sad-lamps-celebrating-new-year-april,Worried about winter? 10 ways to thrive – from socialising to Sad lamps to celebrating the new year in April,2025-12-17T05:00:26.000Z,"The temptation is to sit at home and hibernate, but beating the winter blues can be done. Here’s how to embrace the coldest and arguably most beautiful season tephanie Fitzgerald, a chartered clinical psychologist, used to dread winter. Like many, she coped by keeping busy at work and hibernating at home, waiting for the cold, dark days to be over. But this approach wasn’t making her happy. So she sought out the science that would help her embrace the winter months, rather than try to escape them. In her resulting book, , she writes: “I fell deeply in love with winter … It is a captivating and truly gorgeous season.” How did she change her mindset – and can the 42% of us who say summer is our favourite season learn to love winter too? “I know what it’s like to not enjoy this time of year and feel out of control,” says Fitzgerald. It’s normal to have a mild case of the winter blues, but seasonal affective disorder is “so much more than that – it’s all-pervasive”. And it can develop at any age. “As a neuropsychologist, it’s a really embarrassing thing to admit, but I didn’t realise I had Sad,” she says. “I’d never really had any issue with winter until my mid-20s, but year on year, it was getting harder. Eventually, as soon as the summer solstice was over, I was starting to panic, thinking: the darkness is coming, my mood is going to change.” She thinks the name minimises the condition and makes people less inclined to seek help: “I didn’t feel ‘sad’, I felt really horrific.” After researching the subject, Fitzgerald now manages her symptoms from October to April by sitting in front of a Sad lamp for at least 60 minutes every morning, using a sunrise/sunset alarm clock, taking vitamin D, eating well, exercising and getting plenty of sleep. In her book, she writes: “I feel more balanced, stronger, better able to cope, less emotional and overall lighter.” She advises seeing a healthcare professional if you too are struggling with winter depression. “Even once I got my Sad under control, I realised I was doing winter really badly,” says Fitzgerald. “I rushed into it with my summer diet and exercise regime; I wasn’t making space for it. So I started thinking about living a bit more seasonally.” One of the main changes she has made was going to bed an hour earlier, in 15-minute increments. “As our lives get busier, the temptation is to stay up later and later – it’s known as ‘revenge bedtime procrastination’. Then I’d wonder why I always felt so exhausted. Now I pay attention to what I’m gaining by going to bed, rather than what I’m losing: rest and energy v TikTok and doomscrolling. I stay up later in summer, but I really need that extra rest in winter.” While consistency is the key to sleep hygiene day-to-day, she says, a modest seasonal variation aligns with nature’s rhythms. In Fitzgerald’s diary, New Year’s Day isn’t 1 January; it’s 1 April. She divides the year into roughly April to June (spring), July to September (summer), October to December (autumn) and January to March (winter). Fitzgerald lives in Warwickshire in the UK; an equivalent new year in the southern hemisphere would be 1 October. “My biggest piece of advice is: don’t combine autumn and winter into one big homogenous blob,” she says. “From October onwards, people think: ‘I hate winter.’ But the winter solstice isn’t until 21 or 22 December. has barely begun by Christmas and new year, and then we want spring. We’re setting ourselves up to fail.” She says everyone likes autumn because of the beautiful leaves, but often it’s actually the wettest, muddiest season. So while the bad news is that winter hasn’t even begun yet, there’s good news, too. “There’s so much beauty and joy in winter. January and February are actually quite dry, and March is a lovely transition month.” If you consider the solstice as the first day of winter, she says, then every day brings more light. She writes: “Far from the associations with darkness, winter offers a gentle glow of light, which increasingly brightens throughout the season until it spotlights the start of spring.” For Fitzgerald, January to March is a “planning, restorative, reflective” time of year. “People start their new year resolutions on 1 January, but everything seasonally is saying ‘rest’. Most resolutions fail by the third week of January. We’re more likely to succeed if we realign with the seasons.” By April, she says, “We have all the daylight and warmth to spring into action.” That doesn’t mean that winter is just a season to be endured. “The rhetoric around winter is about how to survive, how to grit your teeth and get through it. I used to just shut winter out. I spent no time with it at all,” Fitzgerald says. “The year I decided to be with winter, to really explore it, my mood lifted. I discovered all these gifts that I’d previously barged past. I saw unreal sunrises and sunsets; bare trees looking their most beautiful; buds and leaves forming ready for spring.” She admits that this change was forced upon her; she was looking after her father-in-law’s dog while he was in hospital. But she enjoyed their winter walks so much, she now has two dogs of her own. “The words people use to describe winter include ‘bleak’, ‘dark’, ‘barren’, ‘cold’, ‘miserable’, ‘depressing’ … We can’t expect to keep this language and appreciate the joys of winter,” says Fitzgerald. “I felt it was important to offer people a different language to think about winter. For example, ‘prinkling’ is that feeling when you’ve been out in the cold and your hands and feet start to warm up.” She feels the spirit of the season is encapsulated by “‘yutori’, a Japanese word that means room to breathe, a sense of space, taking a moment to pause”. Her book highlights many more wonderful words that capture the unique joys of winter, such as “chibbly”: something crisp or crackly with frost. After reading it, I’ve found myself whispering “apricity” on gorgeous blue-sky days – a word that describes the warmth of the sun in winter. As Fitzgerald writes, “To feel the sun unexpectedly warm your bones on a winter’s day is a new level of happiness.” “Winter is a really great time to have a mental health check-in. There aren’t as many distractions as there are in summer, and it’s a lovely reminder that we don’t need to be busy all the time,” says Fitzgerald. At the same time, humans don’t hibernate like bears, as much as we might want to, and we need to have things to look forward to. She has noticed that many people don’t make big plans until Easter, leaving their diaries bare for up to four months. “You can’t have an empty calendar and a full heart! Winter is traditionally a time to connect with the tribe, to share stories and camaraderie with others.” She says socialising is particularly important if you experience low mood in winter, as your brain is craving oxytocin, which comes from closeness and physical contact. Fitzgerald deliberately books meet-ups in January, February and March, from cups of tea with friends to comedy nights, and celebrates events such as the lunar new year and Valentine’s Day (even when single). “Choosing celebration in winter leaves us more fulfilled. Each day has more purpose,” she writes. “Winter can be barren, but only if we make it that way.” She says that winter is perfect for ambiverts – probably the majority of us – who sit somewhere between introverts and extroverts. There is time to go out and celebrate, and time to stay warm and cosy at home. On which note, Fitzgerald “changes the energy” of her home in winter by getting out blankets, lighting candles and playing soft, relaxing music. She puts her wellies by the door, and her thick coat, hat and scarf on the hook. A similar five-minute effort, she says, will set you up for the months ahead. She writes: “It is a useful cue for our brains to slow down, reflect, reconsider and adjust to the season.” Suitably prepped, Fitzgerald hosts what she now calls a hygge day in the run-up to Christmas, or in the hush between Christmas and new year. “I designed them in my 20s, before I’d even heard of hygge [the Danish concept of cosiness, conviviality and contentment],” she says. “Christmas can be a stressful time of year and I wanted a space where my friends and I could just relax, with no obligations or expectations. A few friends come over to watch films, cook, eat, read, chat, sleep – whatever they want. Since then, I’ve seen people through different life stages, from having babies to dealing with health issues.” People turn up in their comfiest clothes, or even pyjamas, and take what they need from the day. One friend wanted some adult company when breastfeeding; another brought presents for wrapping away from her children; a third slept soundly for hours after surviving a tough year. In winter, 61% of people in Britain stop exercising completely, writes Fitzgerald. It’s not out of laziness, or (just) because of the cold and dark – it’s also down to the amygdala part of the brain. Fitzgerald describes this as “the alarm bell of the brain”. When we’re stressed, it can take over our decision-making, a state known as “amygdala hijack”. She writes: “Your amygdala doesn’t really care about future you; it only focuses on what feels good now. Whereas going for a run may benefit future you, the amygdala will counter that sitting on the sofa with some chocolate and ​­binge-​­watching a box set will feel better now.” Ironically, one way to calm down the amygdala down is by exercising, but the average Briton spends 42% more time being sedentary over winter – an extra six hours a day. “Continuing exercise is so important for your mood, especially if you get the winter blues,” Fitzgerald says. “Your brain needs the endorphins, and exercise also helps regulate temperature.” This sounds like a catch-22. How can we override our brains? “I really believe in a seasonal adjustment here too,” she says. For example, if you can’t face a run, a 20-minute walk is enough to reduce cortisol, resulting in a more positive outlook. If darkness is a barrier, she suggests walking with a friend, or joining a dance class. Swapping cardio for strength training will “improve mental agility and executive functioning, helping us with planning, organising and ​­decision-​­making”, while yoga can “reduce stress, anxiety, depression and chronic pain”. “Even just a few daily stretches are beneficial – you can do them in bed if you want,” she says. Whichever kind of exercise you choose, it will also improve your sleep. “It’s really important that we don’t see winter as a reason to stop.” Winter is Fitzgerald’s favourite time of year to cook. She believes that if we listen to our bodies, they crave what is in season. In UK winters, that is protein and root vegetables, which lend themselves to soups, stews and curries. “Winter food is such a gorgeous invitation to slow down and really savour the meal. It takes time to prepare and cook, slowly developing flavours and adding warming spices,” she says. This benefits our brains as well as our bellies. She writes: “Cooking can mindfully absorb us, and we feel good for doing it. Research shows that cooking can boost our confidence and ​­self-​­esteem and result in better mental clarity and focus.” “I’ve started taking my main holiday in winter, not summer. I’ve never understood why, when it’s more likely to be nice weather in the UK, we jet off to somewhere else,” says Fitzgerald. “Winter is a natural point in our seasonal energy to take a break. I was also really taken aback by how much cheaper it is.” That doesn’t mean flying long-haul to chase the sun, or necessarily travelling at all. “Just taking time off to be at home – what a perfect time not to be commuting, and to have a change in routine,” she says. If you’re tied to school holidays, even a micro-break can be beneficial. “Just a half-day off work, if that’s all you can manage, is such a restorative thing to do.” She suggests spending a morning off having a mini winter retreat. Go for a walk, watch a film, dance to your favourite songs or read a book – anything you enjoy that isn’t housework or life admin, and is a change from your usual routine. “It’s good for our brains to get into retreat mode by physically doing something different,” she writes.

https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/22/pushing-buttons-readers-games-of-the-year,The video games readers couldn’t switch off in 2025,2025-12-24T15:00:13.000Z,"In this week’s newsletter: Pushing Buttons readers on their favourite games of the year,  from Death Stranding 2 and Arc Raiders to Ghost of Yōtei and more appy holidays, Pushing Buttons readers! Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list. Over the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardian , but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves! of a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!” of a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.” . I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. But got its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.” co-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!” “My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to the . It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.” game of the year has been my favourite for years: . It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.” . This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).” “The top VR game of 2025 has to be . It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.” “For me, it has to be ! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!” has come out of nowhere and completely my gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.” “One game I played this year will stay with me for life: , an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.” I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!” “There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had me , though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.” is a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.” “My favourite game of the year is, very much, – and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!” in all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.” We’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?

https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/22/the-best-design-and-architecture-of-2025,The best design and architecture of 2025 – from waddling teapots to a museum of razzle-dazzle,2025-12-22T12:00:26.000Z,"This year’s highlights include the remodelling of a Richard Seifert brutalist ‘corncob’ tower, a celebration of Japanese carpentry and a wearable hot-water bottle In a case of contents outshining the container, the V&A’s national museum of everything takes the public up close and personal to a gallimaufry of precious things, from porcelain to poison darts, textiles to tiaras. Elegantly shoehorned into the gargantuan hangar that was originally the broadcasting centre for the 2012 Olympics, it’s an Amazon warehouse crammed with global treasures, setting visitors off on an odyssey of “curated transgression” through an immersive cabinet of curiosities. Subtly abstracting Islamic architectural precepts for the current age, a new social and cultural centre for Houston’s Ismaili community, which will also be enjoyed by the wider public, evokes an experiential serenity that recalls the laconic simplicity of minimalist art. Beautifully built and characterised by an inviting sense of openness, it’s “a renewal rather than a reproduction”, says its architect Farshid Moussavi; a nuanced distillation of geometric and spatial possibilities set within a luxuriant garden landscape. As the Pompidou Centre bids adieu for , its final architecture show was devoted to the work of Austrian architect , a postmodernist provocateur who navigated the currents of the avant garde for five decades while designing everything from exquisite jewellery shops to pneumatic structures. Infamously, he proposed reducing architecture to a series of pills contrived to conjure spatial and sensorial experiences without going to the bother of actually constructing a building. Something of an architectural bogeyman in his day, specialised in monumental office developments, such as London’s Centre Point and Tower 42 in the City, once the UK’s tallest building. But he is now coming in from the cold, with renewed interest in his unapologetically modernist oeuvre. The remodelling of Space House in Kingsway breathes bold new life into one of his distinctive “corncob” towers, with 90% of the original structure retained and restored. The tools and techniques of the exacting and beautiful craft of Japanese carpentry temporarily transformed the basement gallery of London’s Japan House into a woody wonderland of chisels and saws, mortises and tenons, and brackets of infinite intricacy. Jointing techniques rejoice in esoteric appellations, such as ant’s head, shell mouth and scarfed gooseneck. Celebrating master carpenters with the reverence of a high priesthood, it was a dazzling exposition of the skills behind centuries of timber architecture and joinery. Love it or hate it (and apparently the students love it), David Kohn’s gorgeously eclectic housing for venerable New College channels Tolkien, Gaudí and the Teletubbies in a fruity melange of rhubarb-and-custard coloured stonework, a serpentine roof clad in polygonal scales, and a chubby tower embellished with carvings of pangolins, moles and moths. Not merely picturesque decoration, it calls attention to their plight as endangered species while pepping up the Oxford skyline. In asserting that disability-led culture and design is much more than just ramps, this exuberant assemblage features self-tightening shoes and a hands-free vibrator, among other ingenious and pleasure-seeking devices. Designing for disabled people tends to be treated as a monolithic, tick-box exercise, but this thoughtful show explores its multifaceted expansiveness, with a welcome and overdue focus on design by disabled people, who could teach us all a thing or two. From Cossack military fortress to legendary modernist city, Kharkiv is now in Russia’s firing line in its attritional war against Ukraine, with 8,000 of its buildings damaged or destroyed in the last three years. Completed two months before the invasion and combining poignant personal reflection with analytic rigour, this “anti-guide book” keeps Kharkiv’s architectural riches, including the constructivist gem of the Derzhprom building, intact and alive in people’s minds as a model for the city’s postwar future. In response to climate-driven displacement in Bangladesh, Marina Tabassum worked with affected communities to devise a practical and affordable modular housing system. A rigid and highly resilient frame of bamboo with steel connectors is designed to withstand the impact of wind and water, while corrugated sheet metal roofs simplify transport and maintenance. Facades can be made from any locally sourced material and the entire module can be rapidly assembled and dismantled by three people using basic tools. Always a curate’s egg, this iteration of the Venice Architecture Biennale was curated by Italian architect and aspiring tech bro Carlo Ratti, better known for his . Amid an incoherent cacophony of ideas and installations – 3D printing with bacteria, the future of space suits – highlights were hard to discern. Nonetheless, Estonia’s naff cladding exposé, Poland’s take on superstition and buildings, and Bahrain’s proposition that climate comfort is a form of social equity all stood out. During the 3daysofdesign festival in Copenhagen, Hem debuted a highly anticipated pouf created by designer , marking an important milestone for the Swedish furniture brand. The launch is Hem’s first partnership with a Black designer, underscoring both Mensah’s growing influence and the brand’s commitment to broader representation in contemporary design. The pouf had already generated considerable excitement for its thoughtful form and cultural relevance, making the debut one of the festival’s most widely discussed moments. I’d love to put the new bottle into the mix because it says so much about how things are shifting in women’s health. These days there are more practical products that actually make our lives easier. I remember back when I first got my period wearing the biggest, most itchy pads and being in so much pain. That’s a world away from the thoughtfully designed purposeful products which are available now. Frances Priest’s new collection of vessels, on show in her solo exhibition at Blackwell House in Cumbria, is a set of ethereal columns, pinched inwards at their tops and bottoms. They are dusted in dense but limpid motifs that flutter over the ceramic surfaces like the autumnal ghosts of a leaf fall. They seem to be moving yet so delicate as to almost fade into translucency. I have been enamoured with Priest’s oeuvre for some time. I promise that anyone who encounters her vessels in person will fall deeply in love … I was lucky enough to see Noah Davis’s paintings at the gallery he created, The Underground Museum in LA. What I wasn’t prepared for was the thoughtful design of this exhibition (by studios Freehaus and A Practice for Everyday Life). It brought Davis’s practice to life and delicately portrayed his ideas, adventures and artwork. I will always sing about his work to the rooftops, but less is said about the power of great exhibition design. of the seaside and Blackpool is one of my favourite places. This year I visited Showtown – the museum that celebrates the entertainment heritage of this razzle-dazzle-loving town. It’s a great visit for anyone interested in Blackpool’s rich history of magic, circus, illuminations and dance, and is especially good for family visits. The museum’s design allows visitors a glimpse behind the scenes at everything from Punch and Judy puppet shows to the town’s famed drag cabaret Funny Girls. I am in love with their collection of clown costumes, which includes examples by renowned French costumier Gérard Vicaire. For three days in April the tiny shop space Twos on Hackney Road showed a selection of extraordinary clothing from ’s textile archive for sale. Her collection of rare garments and repaired textiles were found in European rag yards, and to view these salvaged clothes up close was remarkable. I found myself noticing small details in the wear of a collar or the fade of a pattern. This was an opportunity to look at the overlooked. As Gomme explained in an accompanying publication: “Looking at these pieces helps us connect to the past. Each piece, each repair holds a memory.” Named Oríkì after the Yoruba practice of praise poetry, the first monograph of Nigerian-born artist Nifemi Marcus-Bello coincided with his solo exhibition at Tiwani Contemporary, Nigeria. The canon of the mainstream design world has long centred on “the West” – its movements, its narratives and its influence on our collective imagination. In Nifemi’s practice, I find a profound significance in his directing of his work toward his country of birth. To me, his work signals a shift in the culture: a moment when the eyes of the world are turning toward new centres of creativity, expanding the very idea of where design leadership can emerge, changing how the history of design will be written in the future. This lived-in exhibition occupied a building which was once British potter Emmanuel Cooper’s studio and home, now restored, owned and lived in by curator Rajan Bijlani. Every piece had its own quiet brilliance, from Lucie Rie to Frank Auerbach, but Le Corbusier’s executive desk stayed with me long after. The engineering is so perfectly judged that it grounds the entire space; its calm authority, precision and purity of purpose are a true feat of design. The remarkable works in this show were so purposefully curated they felt like part of the living space. The whole experience was a privilege – an immersive, quietly meditative dialogue of material, technique and memory. Ibraaz opened this autumn to great acclaim. Created by Kamel Lazaar Foundation – a non-profit cultural organisation rooted in Tunisia and across the Middle East and north Africa – it brings a much-needed space for art and ideas from the Global Majority to the city. Set in a Grade II–listed building in Fitzrovia and redesigned by architect Sumayya Vally, it draws inspiration from diasporic spaces in London. Built in the early 20th century, the building has transformed from a synagogue to a residence, a club, and now a cultural centre. It’s a place for artists and thinkers to meet, exchange ideas and build new connections. Ibraaz launched with work by artist Ibrahim Mahama based on his research into Ghana’s post-independence history, and its upcoming programme spans talks, screenings, music, and residencies. At this year’s Milan Design Week, Loewe stole the show with an exhibition of commissioned from the world’s leading artists. One, by Japanese ceramicist Takayuki Sakiyama, looked as though it was poured from soft-serve ice-cream. Another, by Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola, resembled a lumpy squirrel, meant to be held by its tail. A third, from Pritzker Architecture prize laureate Wang Shu, was a mint-green cuboid with a sliced-off corner in place of a spout. These vessels were whimsical and puzzling, but consistently brilliant – a testament to erstwhile creative director Jonathan Anderson’s knack for convening contemporary craft talent. It also offered proof, amid an arms race of ambitiously scaled installations at design weeks around the world, of the value of small objects of exceptional quality. This remarkable public statue, handcrafted by British artist and stonemason Marcia Bennett-Male, honours Mary Woolaston. As legend has it, Mary was a Black woman and keeper of a well in 17th-century King’s Cross known for its chalybeate waters that she supplied to people as a form of healing. The absence of Black working-class histories has left her story overlooked, but this statue can now be seen at Calthorpe Community Garden in Camden – the former site of the well. It has been designed to inspire communal healing and remind us of our shared humanity. The work forms part of , an initiative to honour Mary and her well. Architect and sculptor Carlos H Matos’s Seat for Surrender was produced for the group exhibition A Stubborn Man and a Hermit Walk Into a Bar which was shown at Mexican architect and muralist Juan O’Gorman’s iconic 1940s Nancarrow House in Mexico City. Made from plywood boards, the chair manages to capture the socialist and nationalist political spirit of O’Gorman’s architecture. The strength and quiet humour of the piece is typical of Matos’s creative work.",Catherine Slessor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This started life as a Lyonnaise dish that I saw at Daniel Boulud’s parents’ farmhouse. My adapted version could be a centrepiece of your New Year’s Eve party, where the molten cheese mixture can be spread on bruschetta and topped with pickles. Equally, however, it could be a main meal shared with friends alongside a salad, pickles and bread. Either way, it’s built for comfort and for joy. Happy New Year to you. I used a 3kg kabocha squash, but if you can’t find one that big, get two medium-sized pumpkins instead. (1 big or 2 smaller ones) – crown prince, delica or kobocha; it’s not about the overall weight, but the size of the pumpkin and the cavity , leaves picked to get 1 tbsp – the most exotic you can find – shredded or chopped small (make sure it’s a vegetarian one), roughly chopped (a vegetarian one), or other vegetarian blue cheese, roughly chopped Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Using a small, serrated knife, cut a roughly 15cm-wide lid off the top of the pumpkin, then scoop out the seeds. Cut out (and reserve) a little extra flesh from the cavity to open up the hole a bit, then rub in a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a half-teaspoon of mixed spice. Heat three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan, then add the chopped onion and the reserved pumpkin flesh left over from making the lid. Cook for six or seven minutes, until soft, then add the garlic, chestnuts, thyme and remaining half-teaspoon of mixed spice, and cook for two minutes. Scrape into a large bowl. Heat three more tablespoons of oil in the same pan, then add the mushrooms, half a teaspoon of salt and six grinds of pepper. Turn up the heat, cook for 15 minutes, until there is no liquid left in the bottom of the pan, then transfer the mushrooms to the onion bowl. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter on a medium heat and, when it’s frothy, add the flour and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk for a couple of minutes, until smooth. Slowly whisk in the milk, beating constantly, until the sauce thickens, then take off the heat. Fold all the cheese bar 25g grated emmental into the mushroom bowl. Spoon the mix into the cavity of the pumpkin until it’s nearly full, then slowly pour in as much of the bechamel as you can. Pop the lid back on the top of the pumpkin, wrap the whole thing in foil and bake for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, until a sharp knife passes easily through the pumpkin skin. Unwrap the foil just at the top, lift off and discard the lid and scatter the reserved 25g grated emmental on top of the filling inside.

At the latter, Haiti Couleurs strives to get his season back on track. Winner of the National Hunt Chase at the Cheltenham festival and the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse in the spring, the eight-year-old made a successful return to action over hurdles at Newbury to tee himself up for last month’s Betfair Chase at Haydock. Haiti Couleurs was pulled up on Merseyside, but is expected to show his true colours on home turf this weekend. Saturday’s lunchtime fixture sees City – pushing hard on the shoulders of pacesetters Arsenal after five consecutive victories – travel to the City Ground with the prospect of three points elevating them, albeit temporarily, to the summit. Forest wilted in a 1-0 defeat by Fulham on Monday, though four wins in their past seven league games is still one more than Sean Dyche’s side managed in their previous 18. The death of Forest legend John Robertson at the age of 72 on Christmas Day following a long illness adds poignancy to the game. Arsenal are a match for any team at home, and after a run of five wins on the spin at the Emirates will more than fancy their chances against Brighton. The visitors are without a victory in their four past matches against the Gunners, although they did battle back from a goal down to draw 1-1 in both meetings last season. Arsenal could be boosted by the return of Kai Havertz. The 26-year-old has not been seen since Arsenal’s first match of the season following surgery on his right knee. However, Havertz returned to training last week and Mikel Arteta admitted he was close to making the squad for their Carabao Cup penalty-shootout triumph over Crystal Palace on Tuesday night. The late afternoon match pits the elite’s form side with one of the league’s most unpredictable teams. Villa arrive at Stamford Bridge on a roll of seven league wins – their best run in the top flight since a nine-game streak between October and December 1910. The hosts Chelsea, curiously, are unbeaten in the three league games they have played this season against teams starting the day above them in the table, beating Liverpool 2-1, Tottenham 1-0, and drawing 1-1 against Arsenal. pick up the thread of our unbeatable football blog. They will be looking forward to Sunday’s Premier League meetings of Sunderland v Leeds and the London derby clash of Crystal Palace v Tottenham as well as four matches in the Africa Cup of Nations and a clutch of Serie A games. Leeds have taken eight points from their past four games to put some daylight between themselves and the bottom three and travel to high-flying Sunderland. The Black Cats, for all their impressive displays, have only scored one goal so far in four outings in December, Chemsdine Talbi’s effort against Liverpool. Sunderland have three strikers in their ranks in Brian Brobbey, Eliezer Mayenda and Wilson Isidor – the latter of whom is their top scorer with four league goals – and Brobbey was the latest of that trio to find the net, scoring against Bournemouth in November. reporting from the Stadium of Light. With both clubs having to bear damaging defeats last weekend, there’s an extra frisson to this London derby, particularly as Palace sprung a double over Spurs last season. Palace are set to be without Chris Richards after the defender required stitches in a cut foot during the Carabao Cup exit to Arsenal. Oliver Glasner said that goalkeeper Dean Henderson will return despite stand-in Walter Benítez’s impressive display against the Gunners. Tottenham will be missing their captain Cristian Romero and Xavi Simons due to suspension.

The men in orange were grateful to Amad Diallo as the Manchester United player scored the Elephants’ only goal in their opener against Mozambique. Wilfried Zaha, playing his first international in more than two years after his surprise recall, wasted several chances and Franck Kessie had two point-blank efforts saved by the Mozambique goalkeeper Ernan. Cameroon won by the same scoreline against Gabon after Karl Etta Eyong’s early strike. The Indomitable Lions, five-time Cup of Nations winners, have been to more World Cups than any other African country but have struggled of late.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/27/merlin-ai-assisted-birdsong-identifying-app-bird-species,‘It brings you closer to the natural world’: the rise of the Merlin birdsong identifying app,2025-12-27T12:00:38.000Z,"Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 bird species around the world hen Natasha Walter first became curious about the birds around her, she recorded their songs on her phone and arduously tried to match each song with online recordings. After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes. “I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!” Merlin is having a moment. The app, in New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021. Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species. For latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says. Angela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says. Mary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.” Merlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain. “I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.” Wall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank. Acheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.” He has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says. John Williamson, who works as a guide for , has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle of large reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says. Merlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird. That said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says. Research has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing. “It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”",Patrick Barkham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The British No 1 has played just one match since Wimbledon, with bone bruising in his left arm , and he is set to be on the sidelines for a little while longer. Draper, ranked 10th in the world, said in a video on X on Boxing Day: “Unfortunately, me and my team have decided not to head out to Australia this year. It’s a really, really tough decision, obviously [with] Australia being a grand slam, it’s one of the biggest tournaments in our sport. “However, I’ve had this injury for a long time, I’m at the very, very end stages of the process and to step back on court into best-of-five-set tennis so soon just doesn’t seem like a smart decision right now for me and my tennis.” Draper’s arm injury plagued him for much of his campaign, coming to a head at the US Open in August, when he withdrew from his second round match before calling time on his season shortly afterwards. The 24-year-old had been pencilled in to return at the Ultimate Showdown grand final in London earlier in December but he followed advice to take more time in his recovery. In skipping the season’s first grand slam, which starts on 18 January in Melbourne, Draper is now likely to target a comeback in February before the defence of his Indian Wells title at the beginning of March. He added: “I’ve obviously been through a fair amount of setbacks so far but by far and away this one has been the most difficult, the most challenging, the most complex one that I’ve had. It’s weird, it always seems to manage to make me more resilient, to make me hungrier, to make me want to become the player I want to become even more. I’m looking forward to getting back out there in 2026 and competing.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/new-battle-of-the-sexes-is-cynical-bid-for-attention-and-own-goal-for-sabalenka,New Battle of the Sexes is cynical bid for attention and own goal for Sabalenka,2025-12-27T08:00:32.000Z,"World No 1’s clash with Nick Kyrgios is on track to being one of the most inane tennis events ever conceived for so many reasons. She reached three of the four grand slam finals, winning her fourth major title at the US Open and further positioning herself as a generational great. From her humble origins as a volatile, one-note ball-basher, the 27-year-old has admirably evolved into an increasingly complete player. Sabalenka is the best player in the world for a second year in succession. The fleeting tennis off-season is usually an opportunity for players and spectators alike to reflect on such great feats before the new season is upon them. This year, however, the December discourse has been derailed by the fast-approaching train wreck Sabalenka stands at the heart of. On Sunday, Sabalenka, the world No 1 in women’s tennis, will play against in an exhibition match in Dubai that has been billed as the Battle of the Sexes. At the end of many weeks of promotion from both players, it remains on track to being one of the most inane tennis events ever conceived. It is not difficult to see why this match would be appealing to Kyrgios, who over the past three years has had an unending string of injuries, playing just six official matches during this period. At 30 years old, it is unclear whether he will be able to return to the tour in any consistent or competitive manner. He is evidently here to earn as much money as he can, while he still can. Sabalenka’s participation in this event is far more noteworthy and disappointing. Since the announcement of the exhibition Sabalenka, Kyrgios and their camp have countered the subsequent criticism by asserting that this should be viewed solely as lighthearted entertainment that will be greatly beneficial for the sport, driving greater interest in tennis and reaching audiences that may not be interested in its regular competitive formats. At the same time, however, it has been marketed by cynically using the challenges faced by women’s sports as engagement bait. Sabalenka has claimed that the contest will “bring women’s tennis to a higher level” and she has also referenced Billie Jean King’s 1973 win over the former player Bobby Riggs to immense fanfare in one of the original Battle of the Sexes bouts, a seminal moment for women’s sports that played an instrumental role in changing attitudes to female athletes. Regardless of the result, this event is an own goal for Sabalenka and women’s tennis. There is nothing at all to learn from it. A top female player cannot be competitive with a top male player and the audience will not believe any scenario where they are. However, women’s tennis is still already a tremendous sport responsible for some of the greatest athletes ever seen. The sport does need more attention and eyes, but that should be on its countless great competitive performances and unforgettable personalities. The last thing women’s tennis needs is more tired discussions questioning equal prize money, which will never change, and women playing best-of-five-sets matches – topics this event is sure to invite. The position of No 1 in the WTA, the leader of the biggest women’s sport in the world, has always been of great symbolism and importance. Sabalenka has used the position she has earned to open up the floor for people to trash her sport. The buildup of this event has been even more grim than anticipated. In early December, Sabalenka and Kyrgios were interviewed by Piers Morgan and the discussion soon turned to the , with Sabalenka rebuking the presence of trans women in the sport. Her comments made global headlines. There are zero trans women on the WTA Tour. A far more relevant and pressing issue is the misogyny that female players continue to face on a daily basis from figures both outside and within the sport. Sabalenka chose to make statements claiming to protect women’s sport ahead of an exhibition that she insists will help it while sitting shoulder to shoulder with Kyrgios, a man who pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend, had to distance himself from Andrew Tate after reposting the proud misogynist on social media and who has faced accusations of sexist remarks involving female players, such as Anna Kalinskaya and Donna Vekic. There is no denying the attention this has generated. The event has been picked up by the BBC and Sabalenka was ushered on to the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, a stage usually only accessible to tennis players immediately after a US Open triumph. It would not be a surprise to see the Dubai Coca-Cola Arena’s 17,000 seats mostly filled. However, attention isn’t always positive. This exhibition is nothing more than a cynical attempt to fabricate controversy to benefit the bank accounts of both the players and all other entities involved. It is an event truly of its era, a time when influencers generate more money for their celebrity boxing bouts than many of the best fighters in the world. No serious figure really believes that Jake Paul leveraging his celebrity to earn untold millions is actually good for boxing, just as no serious figure should believe that this event has any sort of noble cause. Sabalenka and Kyrgios are both represented by the same agency, Evolve, and they all stand to gain handsomely. 2025 was one of the best women’s tennis seasons in recent memory, driven by performances from Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek but with a supreme supporting cast including Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys, players who have made life incredibly difficult for the top two and provoked numerous spectacular matches. As always, the best way to understand the greatness of women’s tennis is to watch women’s tennis.",Tumaini Carayol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/dec/27/11-uk-best-winter-walks-end-cosy-pub,11 of the UK’s best winter walks – all ending at a cosy pub,2025-12-27T07:00:31.000Z,"Too much turkey and Baileys? Blow away the Christmas cobwebs on one of our rambles. And if that doesn’t work, they all end at a pub for a hair of the dog A pub walk is, as everyone knows, the best kind of ramble, and this tranquil circular walk up on to the South Downs boasts not one inn, but three. Ditchling – the start and end point of the walk – has two pubs, the White Horse and the Bull, alongside 36 buildings dating from the 1500s to 1800s. Most notable is , gifted to Anne of Cleves in her divorce settlement from Henry VIII in 1540. Within a couple of minutes’ walk from the heart of the village, you’re in open fields. Head right out of the car park and look for a right turn, signposted “to the Downs”. With the church spire behind you, the path leads diagonally into leafy woodland, before heading south towards Underhill Lane, and the steep climb up to Ditchling Beacon. The Beacon is a pull (248 metres), but the view is spectacular: south to Brighton and the silvery wastes of the English Channel, north across the Sussex Weald to Ashdown Forest and the Surrey Hills. Walk east along the South Downs Way, before an unmade road takes you downhill, directly into the welcoming arms of the Of all the pubs in the area, the Half Moon is my favourite: independent, ungentrified and supportive of local producers. Order a glass of Plumpton Estate wine and check out the pub’s famous painting of dozens of its regulars, including Raymond Briggs and Jimmy Page, done over a nine-month period in 1979. Sunday lunches are hearty roasts, with good vegan options (two/three courses, £24.95/£29.95), alongside a local catch of the day and homemade pies. The good news is that the second half of the walk is flat. Well-signed paths skirt the grounds of Plumpton College, before heading back across fields and past , a new community smallholding. Once at the bridleway, turn back to see a forested “V” of beech, fir and lime trees on the side of the hill, planted in 1887 to mark Queen Victoria’s golden jubilee. I always sneak a peak through the gates at Streat Place, an elegant Elizabethan manor house, before the final, straight-line stretch across open fields to Ditchling – where a choice of pubs awaits. Starting at Highgate tube station, follow Southwood Lane into Highgate village, noting the former home of , a Victorian explorer who had the chutzpah to chat up cannibals in the Amazon. At Pond Square, admire the array of London plane trees (planted in bulk across the city because they could handle the pollution), before proceeding south down Swain’s Lane to (adults £10) to pay your respects to Bob Hoskins (made films), George Michael (made music) and Karl Marx (made a terrible fuss about the exploitation of workers). Cut through Oakeshott Avenue – a distinctive street of mock-Tudor mansions – to Hampstead Heath, where you should resist the temptation to have a dip in the men’s pond (Mum, I’m talking to you), and instead continue west until you hit upon East Heath Road. From here, wiggle north-west to Well Walk, where you’ll find the erstwhile abodes of JB Priestley and John Constable, as well as , a good spot to get some liquid on board. Follow Well Walk west until it splits, at which point err right on to Flask Walk, which you should follow to its terminus. You’re in Hampstead village now, which is either good or bad depending on your disposition. Meander south-east to Belsize village, where it’s possible to rest your legs or get a bagel from . Continue south on Belsize Park Gardens (the composer Frederick Delius lived at No 44) before doing a quick left-right on to Primrose Gardens, about as attractive an oval of terraced housing as you’re liable to find. In Primrose Hill village itself, you’ll find the former homes of Sylvia Plath (opposite Chalcot Square) and Friedrich Engels (opposite Le Tea Cosy). Climb to the summit of the village’s eponymous mound, exit the park on its west side then proceed along St Edmund’s Terrace to St John’s Wood High Street, where even the charity shops are flogging designer gear for serious dough. You’re now a stone’s throw from the zebra crossing on Abbey Road made famous by the Beatles, upon which you should absolutely take your time posing, because the motorists love it. Follow Hall Road to Hamilton Terrace, at the southern end of which you’ll find the former gaff of Joseph Bazalgette, who scored brownie points with Londoners by designing the city’s sewer system. Cross Maida Vale and enter Little Venice, a concentration of canals that probably doesn’t warrant its moniker. Follow the aromas of ale and roast beef to , where dinner awaits. The pub is an absolute beauty, worth a visit for its vintage interior alone. Bottoms up! (Or down, rather …) Bath is a city lost in the countryside, an urban blip in a hug of hills. Even standing in the heart of its Georgian gorgeousness, those green billows beckon you out. So I turn my back on the Abbey, step on the Cotswold Way marker stone by its hefty doors, and walk away. This National Trail starts (or ends) in Bath, and provides the finest route out of town. It’s tricky, picking out the waymarks amid the market crowds, but eventually I duck down Quiet Street and then pass the city’s greatest hits: Queen Square, The Circus, the sweeping Royal Crescent, resplendent in low winter light. As the trail winds westward and up – and there’s a lot of up to come – the tourists thin. I skirt Royal Victoria Park, nod to the golfers on High Common and drop into Weston village. Here, the Cotswolds proper start to rise. I’ve walked and run this route a hundred times, but still … how is this sylvan promenade so close to a city? I feel my lungs expand; I want to sing to the sheep, to the rolling slopes, to the hump of Kelston Roundhill, with its wig of winter-naked trees. Best is Prospect Stile, from where you can see Bath, the Mendips, even Wales. And it’s never better than now: blush pink on a crisp winter afternoon, as if embarrassed by its own good looks. The Cotswold Way heads left here. Instead, I veer right across the racecourse and around the cirque beneath Beckford’s Tower – a gilt-topped monument to Georgian eccentricity, open most winter weekends. Nearby, a footpath leads left to Lansdown Road, and to the hillside This 17th-century inn is a great summer pub: it has Bath’s best beer garden, looking across the winsome Charlcombe valley. With a thick coat, you could still nurse a pint of Proper Job outside. Fortunately, it also has a full wall of mullioned windows. I opt to enjoy the view from inside, where a real fire crackles and good roasts are served. I’ve walked seven miles now, and could bus back to town. But instead I backtrack to the trail below Beckford’s, continuing to walk. The views remain superb. And this way I can wind through salubrious backstreets that deliver peak Bath-ness minus the crowds – not least Lansdown Crescent, a rival to the Royal. Eventually, I make it back to the abbey, this time walking towards its exquisite west front, but still with an eye to the hills beyond. The dog’s tail is wagging hard. We’ve brought her to Broadway on a chilly Saturday afternoon – a time she usually saves for snoring belly up – and there are canines at every turn. Pugs leaving coffee shops, beagles eyeing up knitwear boutiques, terriers cooing over the 16th-century limestone architecture. The dog owners of south-east Worcestershire are out in force, although as visitors our goal lies elsewhere. We’re heading for the hills. Broadway is well named. Some Cotswolds honeypots feel hemmed in, but the wide, handsome high street has a calming sense of space, especially in lesser-visited winter. A rich history too: the Beaker people, the Romans, medieval wool traders, TikTok influencers – all have passed through Broadway, pulled in different ways by the rolling countryside. It’s what’s drawn us, too. We’re walking an , meaning decent signage, loads of puddly kissing gates and big, billowing views. We exit the high street on to a footpath. The escarpment to the south is topped by the turreted silhouette of Broadway Tower, our end goal. Green landscapes swell around us. The first section is an easy ramble across grassy meadows, and ridge and furrow undulations, before the path leads upwards along a thigh-sapping avenue of sycamores. Higher now, we cross more tussocky fields as the panoramas open up. Visible far to the west is the spine of the Malvern Hills. The sky is blue. The wind is cold and mud scented. The dog is in heaven. The complex around the tower arrives suddenly, complete with a cafe and playground. The tower itself – a hexagonal structure built as a folly in the 1790s – is the second highest point in the Cotswolds. Designer William Morris came here regularly to draw inspiration. A patchwork of towns and farmland spills out below us; Birmingham is a speck on the blustery horizon. The Cotswold Way descends steeply back into Broadway and we make for the 17th-century . A 35-year mainstay in the Good Beer Guide, it’s a short wander off the main drag and something of a rarity in these parts: in place of chichi decor it has an open fire, framed beer mats and a well-trodden carpet. Pints of Shagweaver and bowls of cheesy chips hit the spot. And the dog? Ready for that snooze. In this corner of east Lancashire, Pendle Hill – an outlier of the Pennine spine – separates industrial and agricultural, built-up and empty, the urban working-class from the rural upper-middles. Burnley, the start point, is known for coal as well as cotton, football and cricket, not to mention gay rights and Benedictine liqueur. to the banks of the Calder, the river that powered and watered the early mills. From here, follow the to Higham, which gets you on to the southern slopes of Pendle Hill. Sheep, dry-stone walls and steep climbs take over. A zigzagging route takes you up to Newchurch in Pendle, a tiny hamlet perched on a tight bend in the road. St Mary’s church has an “eye of god” on its tower to deter evil spirits, and a tomb by the rear wall bears the name of one Ellin Nutter. The 1651 date could make her a relative of Alice Nutter, who was hanged after the This area is marked as the Forest of Pendle on maps. A former royal chase, it was later used for vaccaries (pastures for cows). Note the recurrence of “booth” in local placenames, alluding to the huts used by herdsmen. Look south for views over the chain of towns that grew up around yarn and cloth. From left (east) to right (west), there’s Barrowford, Colne, Nelson, Brierfield, Burnley, Accrington, Oswaldtwistle and Blackburn – to name only the larger places. For residents of all, Pendle Hill and the nearby West Pennine Moors are the main recreational spaces, airy heights that in the smoky old days provided respite for lungs and legs. The 557-metre climb to the trig point at the top of Pendle Hill goes via Fell Wood, between the two Ogden reservoirs and along Boar Clough – clough is another local word, used for a steep-sided ravine. Barley Moor opens out here, hopefully with a few peewits or even a hawk battling the westerlies. From the trig, it’s a breezy saunter across the mesa-like top of the hill, now with views north to the Yorkshire Three Peaks and Bowland Fells, to drop down to Worston from the Pile of Stones on Pendle Moor. You’ve passed pub options already – at Higham and Barley – but the is a well-liked, well-run village pub all on its own in Worston. There’s a single small snug with three tables and an open fire, and more tables – for food or drink – in the pub lounge and in an annexe. If the weather’s fine, the beer garden is a real beauty. Timothy Taylor’s and local Moorhouse’s ales are generally available. The menu is massive; I rate the seafood sharing board, hot pot and plate pie. From Worston, it’s a short walk to Clitheroe for onward trains and buses. Take care crossing the A59. If you want a longer walk, you can avoid the busy carriageway altogether by taking a loop along West Lane and through the villages of Downham and Chatburn, which have three more pubs between them. I’m climbing up the coast path away from Mawgan Porth beach on the north Cornwall coast, the golden sands and swirling seas way below. Gulls wheel overhead and the wind whips my face, but I’m glad for the breeze after the exertion of the hill. Ahead, I make out the rocky outcrop of Griffin’s Point, an iron age cliff fort with views south to Watergate Bay and Newquay beyond. This is where I turn inland, leaving behind the dramatic sea stacks of Bedruthan Steps and heading east to return to the village of St Mawgan. It’s around the halfway point of one of my favourite circular walks in Cornwall, a 5.4-mile loop that takes in a wide variety of terrain, from coastal sections and sheep-speckled fields to woodlands scattered with streams, pines and badger setts. You could start and end at Mawgan Porth, but I like to begin in St Mawgan, parking on the road outside The Falcon Inn. From here, I follow the river north-west then cross a bridge, passing the acers and azaleas of the Japanese Garden (closed in winter) and a row of cottages with quaint names such as the Mouse House. Forking left, I’m on to the public footpath signposted towards Mawgan Porth. After Windsor Mill, a settlement dating back to the middle ages, I cross a stile and follow the path through the trees, the River Menalhyl trickling to my left. The track quickly turns rugged underfoot, with exposed tree roots and leaves that make a satisfying crunch with each step. Beneath the trees, some with orange lichen on their trunks, others with stubborn hawthorn berries still clinging to branches, there’s shelter from the elements; a blissful contrast to the bracing sea breeze I’m about to experience on that coast path. After around half an hour on the coast, I turn inland for a final stretch through fields and across streams. I return to the Falcon via the St Mawgan churchyard, pausing at the memorial to 10 men who died from hypothermia on a boat that drifted ashore near Watergate Bay in December 1846. I wonder if any of those men frequented this 16th-century inn, which is under new ownership this winter but has kept a traditional feel, with its original fireplace, exposed beams and dark wooden bar. I join the locals enjoying pints of ale from the pub’s own microbrewery in Penryn. It’s a warm, welcome respite after miles walking through the Cornish winter elements. “Walk and pub?” Growing up in the Peak District, these two things were never mutually exclusive. You can keep your Gore-Tex-clad scrambles, your emergency crampons, your Wainwright “bagging” and Three Peaks conquering. I’m worn out just thinking about all that. Give me a route I can do in an hour and a half, that’s manageable with a hangover or an unruly toddler or, God forbid, both. Give me a route where the scenery is quietly breathtaking and ever-changing but I can do it in a pair of beaten-up trainers. Give me a route that ends in a fantastic pub, where I can fill my belly with lovingly cooked local produce and slake my thirst on local ale. Earwig on a mix of day-trippers and local “characters” rubbing along just fine in front of one of three roaring fires. Give me the walk from Bakewell to I’ve done this walk so many times I can practically hear the footsteps from different phases of my life ringing out from the pavement as we set off from Bath Gardens and leave the (the “birthplace” of the original Bakewell followed later, just so you know and don’t mortally embarrass yourself when you visit) and the bustling market town behind. Tracing the A6 road out past the Lambton Larder cafe and pretty Georgian houses, we cross the River Wye at the stone bridge on the right, just past the fire station. We head straight on past Lumford House, with its blue plaque for Richard Arkwright Jr, whose inventor and industrialist old man was kind of a A brief incline brings us out above the town and the show-off panoramic views to the imposing woods above Chatsworth and the fields down towards Hassop and Ashford-in-the-Water, beautifully pockmarked with wild pink heather. A few years ago, I proposed in the field of canary yellow rapeseed blazing in the far distance. Today, my bovine-phobic wife pushes me forward as a human shield as we take the left fork of the footpath into a field of cows that stare at us like the locals from We cross a stile into a wooded stretch and emerge at a field full of sheep (less foreboding, apparently) and the road heading into Great Longstone. Following the public footpath over a stone stile to the left brings us out into an almost laughably bucolic field of beech and sycamore trees. We skirt around the village of Great Longstone and into Little Longstone, with its red phone box and Bertie Bassett-inspired . The Packhorse Inn sits on the right, complete with a sign that says “Kids, dogs and muddy boots, welcome”. We don’t have any of those things today but we do, crucially, have a thirst on. “Walk and pub?” An unbeatable combination. The A487 is not one of Britain’s most celebrated highways. In one stretch, it’s reduced to a single-track squeeze that requires drivers to sneak around a blind corner and pray no one is coming the other way. And what is the source of this nasty constriction that cannot be removed? A wonderful little pub called . Hemmed in by a wooded hill behind, the fishing boat-speckled sea in front and that crow-black trunk road, it is no wonder that the front door is of the sliding variety. If it opened outwards, the tailback would block Pembrokeshire. Serving good beer surrounded by nautical memorabilia, polished wood and black-and-white photographs of drinkers down the ages, the Ship in Lower Town, Fishguard, has hosted some famous drinkers in its time. One face stands out from the fading photos: Richard Burton, at the peak of his thespian career, barrelling down that single-track snicket, his eye on the front door of the pub, no doubt thirsting for a pint of Double Dragon. Burton was in town for the 1971 filming of Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood. Our walk to reach this watering hole starts up the coast at the pretty village of Newport (the pub is cash-only so use the ATM here), then follows the Wales Coast Path. Almost immediately, the flavour of the route is apparent: a big, banging seascape filled with jagged rocks, epic cliffs and roaring seas. Even the signs seem to have an extra robustness about them: “Keep to the Path. Cliffs Kill” screams one and, more mysteriously, “Caution. Deep Animal Holes Ahead” reads another. The route rolls along, passing several fine coves before tackling Dinas Mawr, a formidable headland. In 1954, this dramatic coastal feature was used in the filming of Moby Dick, starring Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab. Three-masted ships like Ahab’s Pequod were once a common sight along here, until the great storm of 1859 wrecked many of them. At the sea’s edge in Cwm-yr-Eglwys, I search the ruined churchyard of St Brynach’s and find tombstones for the mariner John Harries and Thomas Laugharne, master of the schooner Eliza. That may have been the Eliza that got smashed up on the Llŷn peninsula. One other casualty of the 1859 storm was the church itself, of which only one wall survives. It was to New Quay, on this stretch of coast, that Dylan Thomas moved in 1944, finding inspiration for unforgettable characters such as the lascivious fisher Nogood Boyo and Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, so house-proud that the sun must wipe its shoes before sneaking through her chintz curtains. Burton was a slam dunk to narrate both the 1954 BBC radio play and the 1971 film. I pass the ruined Fishguard Fort and its cannon, last fired during the abortive French invasion of 1797, then reach the pub as it opens (4pm on Saturday and Sunday, 5pm Wednesday to Friday). There are only snacks, but the beer is good and the decor satisfyingly unchanged since Burton sat in here boozing with Peter O’Toole, their Daimlers parked down by the quayside. Elizabeth Taylor did not show her face, although local legend has Burton on the payphone, ordering Hollywood’s finest to “get her fat arse down to Pembrokeshire”. They were divorced three years later, remarried, then divorced again after two more. 2 hours (with option to extend) follows its namesake river from Balerno, near the Pentland Hills, through the heart of Edinburgh to Leith, the city’s historic port district, where it meets the sea. This walk follows the final stretch. In the grounds of Modern One on Belford Road – one of Scotland’s – visit the crescent lakes of Charles Jencks’s then head to the left corner of the car park, passing a Henry Moore sculpture. Double iron gates lead to steps descending to the Water of Leith. Cross the footbridge and turn left, look for a figure of a man in the river, the first of four of Antony Gormley’s 6 Times figures that are visible on this walk. The path is marked throughout by small brown signs. Some sections offer step-free alternatives: for the most interesting landscape, stick to the riverbanks. The path winds through Dean Village, once an industrial slum, now one of Edinburgh’s most incongruous and enchanting neighbourhoods. The half-timbered cottages look more Bavarian than Scottish. Look out for , an imposing red-brick building, a rare example of Arts and Crafts style in Edinburgh, commissioned by the owner of the Scotsman newspaper in the 1880s to house local workers. Walk under the high arches of Thomas Telford’s 1832 Dean Bridge towards St Bernard’s Well, a pretty Roman-style folly with a statue of Hygeia, the ancient Greek goddess of health. Arriving in Stockbridge, perhaps pause in one of its excellent cafes, before crossing Deanhaugh Road to steep steps where the route continues. This section curves around some of Edinburgh’s distinctive “colony houses”, built for artisans and skilled workers between 1850 and 1910. Ahead you’ll see the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh – add a loop if you have time (free entry, donations welcome). Otherwise, the path forks right to follow the river. At a junction signed for Rocheid Path, keep right to steep steps to Brandon Terrace. Cross to Warriston Road, a high walkway built as part of flood defences. From here, the route skirts the wooded edges of St Mark’s Park to the wildlife-rich Coalie Park – keep an eye out for more Gormleys and, if you’re lucky, kingfishers. Our walk ends in Leith, where the river widens and is dotted with restaurants, bars and delis. For a cosy pub lunch head to the , a welcoming family-run pub, with excellent home-cooked food. The cullen skink is legendary and the all-day big breakfast, served in a sizzling skillet, is hard to beat. turned Whitley Bay seafront into a hazardous foam party, then dragged about a metre of sand out to sea. Whenever I return home, once or twice a year, I still do a double-take every time I see the sunken beach and marvel at the newly exposed sandstone, ripe sea glass and pebbles of coal. I’m always on the hunt for a few standout pieces to add to my shelf of beach finds back in my landlocked Madrid apartment. On a still, sunny morning at low tide, the shoreline glitters with wildness. I spot a crab strutting along the water’s edge, then burying itself alongside looping sandworms. Crows survey the scene just as closely, before zigzagging between the rocks in search of their salty prey. I look out to sea and see a creche of gull chicks bobbing up and down on the gentle waves, flying off in fright when a seal pops up for air. I look inland and tune into an orchestra of speckled starlings chirrupping around the and begin my walk north up the sand, the mild sun warming my back. At low tide, a good stretch of this route can be done on the beach. When the sand runs out, simply head up to the promenade and let the footpath guide you onward to St Mary’s Lighthouse, on its own tiny island and accessible only at low tide. I’ve always wished there was a pub on this poetic rocky outcrop, but that would have brought this pub-bound winter story to an abrupt end, missing arguably the best bit. Leave the island, climb up to the clifftops and catch your breath while enjoying a panoramic view of the lighthouse below, interrupted only by fluffy coastal grasses bowing in the North Sea gusts. and, if you get it right, you can watch the water engulf the path to St Mary’s Island, rendering it an offshore Northumbrian outpost until low tide returns. From here, almost every northbound footpath leads you to , a Grade II-listed building dating back to 1748 and the first pub you’ll encounter as you cross into Northumberland. Over the years, the pub’s interior has been modernised yet has never lost its cosy charm. The brass‑railed bar, log fire and dark wood‑panelled walls and ceilings still anchor the snug rooms, while colourful soft furnishings and a lively menu have brought it gracefully up to date. The old sandstone building sits a coal pebble’s throw from the border with North Tyneside, so I settle in beside the log fire, wine in hand, and reflect on how my ancestors once fought over the very land where I now sit in complete comfort. Llanthony Priory, nestled in the Vale of Ewyas, makes for an enticing base to explore the Black Mountains, here in the easternmost part of Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons). in the early years of the 12th century by William de Lacy, a Norman knight who was said to have been so taken with this remote location that he immediately renounced the way of the sword for the life of a hermit. Some stories suggest he was inspired by Dewi Sant (Saint David), who sought tranquillity in this same place in the sixth century. Today, the priory is just a ruined shell, but the allure of Llanthony, flanked by steep glacial ridges, endures. Particularly energetic walkers like to embrace the 16-mile loop out along Offa’s Dyke Path to Hay Bluff and Lord Hereford’s Knob, before tracking back along the Cambrian Way trail. I, however, have a more modest tramp in mind – that will get me back to the priory’s Cellar Bar just in time for lunch (served from 12.30pm to 2pm on weekends during the winter months). With its whitewashed vaulted stone ceilings and wooden benches, this snug will provide a cosy reward for whatever the Welsh weather may have in mind. My route embraces the tough stuff first – a short but sharp ascent following the Beacons Way walking trail up Cwm Bwchel to Bâl Bach (a lower section of the 607-metre Bâl Mawr). Viewing the route from Llanthony, you may be tempted to head straight to the pub. Don’t be put off, though, because the views from the top of the ridgeway are a more than sufficient reward for the climb you’ve undertaken. It’s a clear day and the nearby peaks of Sugar Loaf and Skirrid Fawr stand out against the blue-and-white clouded sky. Above Llanthony Priory, on the other side of the valley, a long treeless ridgeway connects Hatterrall Hill with Hay Bluff. Further up the Vale of Ewyas lies Capel-y-Ffin, once the summer grange for the canons of the priory. It was here that beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg wrote his acid-enabled – his neo-romantic riff on Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey From Bâl Bach, I follow the Cambrian Way south until I reach a sharp left fork into Coed Tŷ Canol. Down in the western valley lies , a medieval church named after another hermit holy man and renowned for its 10th-century font and intricately carved 15th-century wooden screen. A detour to Saint Issui is tempting, but will have to wait for another walk. This morning, it’s time to descend off the ridgeway following forestry tracks and woodland paths back to Llanthony. A little over three hours after I began, I emerge from Llanthony Wood into open fields and the stone facade of the priory comes into view. A pint of Felinfoel Double Dragon beckons. Surely Ginsberg, and maybe even William de Lacy, would approve.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’d gone from running a busy home, juggling work, family and the everyday chaos that comes with it, to suddenly being ripped out of normality and forced to slow down in ways I never expected. When I finally returned home, I felt fragile – physically and emotionally. Getting dressed felt like climbing a mountain some days, never mind feeling remotely like myself. So I decided to try something small but surprisingly powerful: I started sharing my “fits of the day” on TikTok, which basically means I started sharing my outfits. My most-liked video is a in an unremarkable cord skirt, oversized collar blouse and knee-high boots. It began as a simple promise to myself. Posting a video meant I had to get up, get dressed and show up in some form. It was a combination of accountability, motivation and a way to reconnect with the world again. I honestly didn’t expect it to become anything more. However, has a funny way of surprising you. Each video starts the same way, with my tiny bio: “Hi, I’m Jen: fat, flat, over 50 and with a feeding tube.” TikTok is bursting with outfits of the day (OOTDs) fit checks, and women absolutely smashing it with their personal style. There are some brilliant over-50 creators too ( are all fantastic). But there aren’t many who look like me: fat, over 50, flat-chested – thanks to a double mastectomy 18 years ago – and navigating extra health challenges. I call myself fat because that’s what I am – it’s a descriptor, not an insult. Taking ownership of the word removes its sting, and it’s my way of taking up space unapologetically. For years after my double mastectomy, I hid my flatness behind baggy tops, convinced I had to disguise the shape of my chest or lack of it. Over time, though, I realised I didn’t want to hide. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with the humble sweater vest (or tank top, if you’re my age!). They make me feel pulled together even on low-energy days. And here’s the lovely thing – TikTok loves them too. Sweater vest appreciation is strong. Every time I post one, people ask where it’s from and whether I can share more. There’s something deeply affirming about finding others who love the same things you do. Apparently, “granny chic” is exactly where it’s at on TikTok. Who knew? I certainly didn’t. My comments section is full of people who love what I love: bold colours, textures, feminist prints and clothes with proper personality. For too long, society has made older women, especially fat older women, feel invisible. The fashion industry rarely shows bodies like mine, and social media can make it feel like you’re only “allowed” to enjoy fashion if you fit a certain mould. But that needs to change. over 50 account for 27% of all consumer spending, and we’re now the wealthiest and most active generation ever. Time to start seeing that reflected in fashion and online spaces. I’ve always believed in seeing clothes on women, with real bodies, living real lives. That’s the inspiration I crave. And funnily enough, younger creators have become a huge source of it for me ( , I’m looking at you – you inspired that ). Their joyful, experimental outfits with zero fear have encouraged me to see my wardrobe differently. I’ve rediscovered pieces I forgot I owned, such as treasured knitwear, tried combinations I’d never have thought of, such as a with a long-sleeved vest underneath and a cardigan worn fastened as a jumper, and stopped saving “nice” things for imaginary special occasions. There’s something wonderfully freeing about wearing whatever feels good that day, whether that’s a floral skirt, a cosy knit or one of my beloved sweater vests. As the videos gained views, I started gaining followers too – but more importantly, a genuinely supportive community of nearly 4,500 formed around my fits. They cheer me on, offer styling ideas and leap into the comments the moment someone starts being rude or dismissive. For every troll, there are 20 wonderful people ready to drown them out with kindness. It’s restored a bit of my faith in the internet, to be honest. And in turn, if my little videos encourage even one woman to get dressed, feel good, or treat herself with a bit more gentleness, then that’s a win in my book.",Jen Walshaw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utterly surreal. A home Euros in 2022 had provided wave after wave of emotion, the culmination of decades of growth, setbacks, fight and deep longing. Everyone sang from the same hymn sheet for that maiden Euros win: the written press, broadcasters, fans, sponsors, Football Association, players and Sarina Wiegman and her staff. There were tears – lots. Having begun covering women’s football for the Guardian via a weekly column before the 2017 Euros, then gone full-time before the 2019 World Cup, I felt as if I had lived that progression, journeyed with them, contributed, in some small way, to that growth. was different, surreal, an almost psychedelic experience. In many ways better than 2022. This was England’s first major tournament win – male or female – away from home. Expectations were high but injuries, retirements and inconsistent performances and results had made most aware that a title defence wouldn’t be a procession. That made it all the more magnificent. The vibe was different too. It wasn’t until the tournament was well under way in 2022 that the Lionesses swung into general public consciousness. This time, the wider public was on board from the off, invested in the retirements of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby, in the stepping back of Millie Bright and in the fitness of Georgia Stanway and the Laurens (James and Hemp). England fans had travelled in such numbers that you were transported back to the feel of the grounds of 2022 and the first major tournament win away from home didn’t feels as if it took place on foreign soil. Then, there was the football, which delivered the most thrilling and nail-biting ride, everyone rising and falling together in shared agony and ecstasy with each fightback, period of extra time and penalty shootout. Try writing through those games. The late kick-offs, many 9pm local time, combined with the drama on the pitch made me feel as if I spent each match on a metaphorical tightrope, trying to write a match report that could be adapted for abject failure or epic turnaround in seconds. It is hard to get across what it’s like covering a major tournament as a journalist. It is a weird all-consuming whirlwind of an experience. The schedule is erratic, fluid and unsociable. Around the work, you try to slot in experiences of the place you’re in but feel as if you’re just passing through. Mentally, I switched off by drawing moments from the tournament or patterns I’d seen and liked on to a piece of A4 lino, then cutting around them with the idea of creating a printable tapestry of the month. Matchdays really mess with your body clock. I’ve always described the period up to two hours before kick-off as the calm before the storm. There isn’t much to do because the match will set the tone of the coverage. Anything published before will be out of date as soon as the whistle blows. Your working day begins predominately at 9pm, sometimes 6pm. Then the full force of the storm hits and it rages until about an hour and a half after the match. Press conferences and player mixed zones mean not leaving stadiums until past 2am if extra time or penalties are involved. Then, you can’t wind down for hours, too wired to sleep having seen and experienced what you just have and having tried to convey it in 900-plus words. It’s exhilarating and exhausting and, while maintaining a level of professional objectivity and impartiality, you bond with members of the squad and fellow journalists. It’s impossible not to when you spend so much of your time getting players to open up and reveal deep parts of themselves and their thoughts. We see the players at their best and their worst, after good individual performances and bad, with strapping or ice on their legs and grass and mud stains on their shirts, embracing their families in front of us, with heads bowed at times and with medals around their necks at others. I couldn’t help but be hugely impressed when Jess Carter stopped in the mixed zone to talk to us so openly after she had a terrible time against France in . I felt humbled by Michelle Agyemang’s composure and thoughtfulness before the game against the Netherlands when the 19-year-old sat for an interview in a circle of significantly older journalists. I was in awe as Lucy Bronze limped to us in the mixed zone to reveal she had The final is a blur. You are so locked into the work – report, interviews in the mixed zone, press conference, rewrite of the report, follow-up plans – that it’s hard to recall the details. What I remember most is the aftermath, the jugs and jugs of beer, the match replayed on giant screens in the pub that enabled a motley crew of journalists to watch it back as fans, cheering, chanting, drinking and eating pizza, as the bemused pub landlord looked on. I’m still not sure what we witnessed in Switzerland. It was the most gritty, gutsy, chaotic of tournament runs and most unlikely way to reach silverware. Utterly unforgettable.",Suzanne Wrack,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China’s devastating floods, in which thousands of people were displaced, were the third most expensive, causing about $12bn in damage, with at least 30 lives lost. The 10 worst climate-related disasters of 2025 amounted to more than $120bn in insured losses, according to The true losses are likely to be much higher, as only the insurance costs could be reliably measured. The human costs, in lives, displacement and lost livelihoods, are uncounted. Devastating events such as these are often grouped together as “natural disasters”, as if they were simply the consequences of normal weather variation. But this is a misperception, according to the report’s authors. Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College London, said damaging events were increasing in frequency and intensity owing to the human-made climate crisis. “The world is paying an ever-higher price for a crisis we already know how to solve. These disasters are not ‘natural’ – they are the inevitable result of continued fossil fuel expansion and political delay,” she said. While the economic cost of disasters is often accounted as greater in developed countries, where people and businesses can afford insurance, the true toll in developing countries can be much higher. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “While wealthy nations count the financial cost of disasters, millions of people across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean are counting lost lives, homes and futures. In 2026, governments must stop burying their heads in the sand and start responding with real support for people on the frontlines.” The top 10 list is far from the whole of the damage to the planet: a further 10 major extreme weather events that each came in at less than $1bn in damage were also examined in the report, and many less costly examples did not make either list. , where more than 1.4 million people were displaced, and $5bn incurred in damages.

Floods hit Democratic Republic of the Congo in April, then Nigeria followed in May, with 700 deaths. Floods in India and Pakistan killed more than 1,860 people, cost about $6bn, and affected more than 7 million people in Pakistan alone. , droughts hit Canada, and there were record heatwaves in Scotland. , rich countries agreed to triple the amount of finance available to help poor countries adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. But the tripling, expected to reach $120bn by 2035, will still be nowhere near enough to fund all the protection needed in developing countries. The bill for extreme weather damages will continue to rise until the world slashes greenhouse gas emissions and phases out fossil fuels, added Christian Aid’s chief executive, Patrick Watt. “These climate disasters are a warning of what lies ahead if we do not accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels,” he said. “They also underline the urgent need for adaptation, particularly in the global south, where resources are stretched and people are especially vulnerable to climate shocks.” At Cop30, an attempt to start work on was relegated to the status of a voluntary initiative, rather than a compulsory task for all countries.

The most peaceful place is the grave: there nobody protests,” says Dr Sima Samar. Samar has spent a lifetime working for the ideals of a country that no longer exists. The Hazara human rights advocate and medical doctor served as vice-president of Afghanistan, and as its minister for women, shortly after the US-led invasion began. For nearly 20 years, she led the country’s Independent Human Rights Commission (IHRC). Now in exile, she tells the Guardian she fears her country is being forgotten while the oppressive rule of the Taliban is normalised and solidified. Conflicts around the world jostle for global attention: the genocide in Darfur; bombardment and starvation in Gaza; ceaseless, grinding conflict in Ukraine; terrorism in Bondi. “The international community has lost interest, has stopped paying attention,” Samar says. “There are conflicts all around the world, some very bad conflicts, but Afghanistan is also important … there is a moral responsibility to defend human rights everywhere. “What is security when a woman is not safe to walk in the street? What is security if a girl cannot go to school? What is security if families have food for lunch but no food for dinner. There’s no human security.” Afghanistan has a long memory – especially for conflict. Where the world might see the tumult of unprecedented events, Afghans see history repeating. Samar says the world’s current neglect of Afghanistan is akin to the indifference after the collapse of the Soviet-backed government in 1992. The country fell into brutal civil war, ended only by the first rise to power of the Taliban, providing a safe harbour from where Osama bin Laden plotted the 9/11 attacks. “We have seen the consequences of forgetting, of isolating Afghanistan in the past,” she says. “We know what happens, not only for Afghanistan, but for the world.” Visiting Australia, Samar spoke at Canberra’s Parliament House on 14 December, reflecting on taking carriage of a shell of a country in the aftermath of the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. She says a small band of democrats paled before the immensity of the task before them. “We had to start from scratch: draft a new constitution, create ministries and rebuild institutions. I remember walking through Kabul’s shattered streets thinking that, if we could keep girls in school and women in the workplace, Afghanistan would never again fall to darkness. “Over the next 20 years, we tried.” There were wins. Samar’s foundation, the Shuhada Organisation, opened schools and hospitals in remote places that had never known either. The foundation trained midwives (Afghanistan has one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world), teachers and administrators to run rural provinces. As chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, Samar spent nearly two decades documenting violations and beseeching those in authority not to look away, as she puts it: “urging … the world to remember that justice must never be sacrificed for convenience”. “There were moments of genuine progress,” Samar said in her speech. “Millions of girls returned to school. Women sat in parliament, ran ministries, and held prominent positions in civil society.” The gains were fragile always, and regression common, but, in individual lives, there was real change. Samar tells the Guardian it was devastating to see the collapse of an idea of a country to which so many had given so much. “We sacrificed a lot, all of us, but at the end we gave the country back to the same group which was removed in 2001.” For all its idealism and the billions in international support, that government was always brittle, riven by corruption and mismanagement, undermined by continued insurgent violence. Progress was always piecemeal, often compromised. In August 2021, in the face of US withdrawal (a deal – without the elected government of Afghanistan in the room), the country changed with terrifying swiftness – Kabul fell in a single morning. The Taliban, which retook control, promised a reformed administration. In an attempt to court international legitimacy and recognition, it vowed there would be no discrimination against women, no persecution of religious or ethnic minorities, no retribution against those who had served the former government, or international forces. But always with the caveat of The reality has been, instead, a more sophisticated oppression, but conscious of presenting a more benign face in pursuit of international credibility. “Two decades later, we are again speaking of Afghanistan in the language of absence and erasure,” Samar told her Parliament House audience. “Erasure of women from the public; absence of protection for persecuted groups; and absence of justice. “Today, girls in Afghanistan are banned from secondary school. Universities are closed to women. Women cannot work for NGOs, visit parks, or travel without a male guardian. Women cannot even be heard in public. The word ‘apartheid’ is not an exaggeration; it is the lived reality for women and girls in Afghanistan.” Taliban arguments about modesty and protection, about governing “in accordance with our values” are self-serving falsehoods, Samar says, born of a narrow, suffocating vision of a country that has always known a breathtaking diversity of ethnicity, language and culture. Samar says tragedy lies, too, in international obeisance. “This is not about culture or religion; it is about power and control,” she says. “And it thrives in silence, including the silence of the international community, the fatigue of donors, and the complacency of governments who speak of human rights in press releases or places like Geneva and New York but whisper them away in negotiations.” Samar praises Australia for its acceptance, over decades, of Afghan refugees, particularly from the persecuted Hazara minority. She says the country can take more. And she says Australia’s efforts under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) are vital in attempting to hold the Taliban accountable for its abuses. Samar urges Australia’s to maintain diplomatic recognition of the Afghanistan embassy in Canberra, which was credentialled by the former government, rather than handing diplomatic recognition to representatives of the Taliban. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has warned the current ambassador (serving in exile) will not have his credential renewed in February. Dozens of countries, including Germany and Norway, have credentialled Taliban diplomats, even without formally recognising its government. But retaining recognition of the former government’s envoys would carry a powerful message, Samar argues, not just for the Taliban, but the broader international community. In Afghanistan, Samar sees slivers of hope still. Small acts of defiance take on a disproportionate significance. “A teacher who continues to teach five or 10 girls in secret is a resistance against ignorance, a woman who comes out into the street, whose voice is heard, is a resistance against erasure,” she says. Samar has already rebuilt a country once. She knows a future rebuilding of Afghanistan will be the work of younger generations, but she hopes to glimpse the beginnings of that brighter, peaceful future. Exiled since the fall of Kabul on that chaotic, fearful morning in August 2021, she would like, one day, to return. Like the country she worked for decades to build, the house where she was born in Ghazni, has been destroyed. “But I really do dream of it still. It is strange, because it is not there any more, but I dream of it,” she says. Still standing is Samar’s house in the capital, Kabul, a place she knows she may never see again. But to those who ask, she answers her home is in Afghanistan. “I am still very much an Afghan. I would love to return one day. I keep saying that I would like to die in my country.”",Ben Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/26/ai-dark-ages-enlightenment,"Our king, our priest, our feudal lord – how AI is taking us back to the dark ages",2025-12-26T05:00:06.000Z,"Since the Enlightenment, we’ve been making our own decisions. But now AI may be about to change that his summer, I found myself battling through traffic in the sweltering streets of Marseille. At a crossing, my friend in the passenger seat told me to turn right toward a spot known for its fish soup. But the navigation app Waze instructed us to go straight. Tired, and with the Renault feeling like a sauna on wheels, I followed Waze’s advice. Moments later, we were stuck at a construction site. A trivial moment, maybe. But one that captures perhaps the defining question of our era, in which technology touches nearly every aspect of our lives: who do we trust more – other human beings and our own instincts, or the machine? as “man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.” Immaturity, he wrote, “is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another”. For centuries, that “other” directing human thought and life was often the priest, the monarch, or the feudal lord – the ones claiming to act as God’s voice on Earth. In trying to understand natural phenomena – why volcanoes erupt, why the seasons change – humans looked to God for answers. In shaping the social world, from economics to love, religion served as our guide. Humans, Kant argued, always had the capacity for reason. They just hadn’t always had the confidence to use it. But with the American and later the French Revolution, a new era was dawning: reason would replace faith, and the human mind, unshackled from authority, would become the engine of progress and a more moral world. “ !” or “Have courage to use your own understanding!”, Kant urged his contemporaries. Two and a half centuries later, one may wonder whether we are quietly slipping back into immaturity. An app telling us which road to take is one thing. But artificial intelligence threatens to become our new “other” – a silent authority that guides our thoughts and actions. We are in danger of ceding the hard-won courage to think for ourselves – and this time, not to gods or kings, but to code. ChatGPT was launched only three years ago, and already one global survey, published in April, found that in the previous six months. Whether deciding to end a relationship or who to vote for, people are turning to machines for advice. According to OpenAI, 73% of user prompts . Even more intriguing than our dependence on AI’s judgment in daily life is what happens when we let it speak for us. Writing is now among the most common uses of ChatGPT, second only to practical requests such as DIY or cooking advice. The American author : “I write entirely to find out what I am thinking.” What happens when we stop writing? Do we stop finding out? Worryingly, some evidence suggests that the answer might be yes. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor the given access to AI, search engines like Google, or nothing at all. Those who could rely on AI showed the lowest cognitive activity and struggled to accurately quote their work. Perhaps most concerning was that over a couple of months, participants in the AI group became increasingly lazy, copying entire blocks of text in their essays. The study is small and imperfect, but Kant would have recognised the pattern. “Laziness and cowardice,” he wrote, “are the reasons why so great a proportion of men … remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others to establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature.” Sure, AI’s appeal lies in its convenience. It saves time, spares effort and – crucially – offers a new way to offload responsibility. In his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom, the German psychoanalyst Erich Fromm argued that the rise of fascism could be explained in part by people preferring to surrender their freedom in exchange for the reassuring certainty of subordination. AI offers a new way of surrendering that burden of having to think and decide for yourself. AI’s greatest allure is that it can do things our minds can’t – sift through oceans of data and process it at unprecedented speed. Sitting in the car in Marseille, this was, after all, why I chose to trust the machine instead of my friend in the passenger seat (a decision she took as an insult). With access to all the data, surely the app must know best – or so I thought. . It produces knowledge, but without necessarily deepening human understanding. We don’t really know how AI reaches its conclusions – even the programmers admit as much. Nor can we verify its reasoning against clear, objective criteria. So when we follow AI’s advice, we are not guided by reason. We are back in the realm of faith. : when in doubt, trust the machine – that may become our future guiding principle. AI can be a formidable ally to humans in rational inquiry. It can help us invent drugs, or free us from “bullshit jobs”, or doing our taxes – tasks that demand little thought and offer little satisfaction. All the better. But Kant and his contemporaries did not plead the case of reason over faith just so humans could build better shelves or have more spare time. Critical thinking was not just about efficiency – it was a practice of freedom and human emancipation. Human thinking is messy and full of errors, but it forces us to debate, to doubt, to test ideas against one another – and to recognise the limits of our own understanding. It builds confidence, both individually and collectively. For Kant, the exercise of reason was never just about knowledge; it was about enabling people to become agents of their own lives, and resist domination. It was about building a moral community grounded in the shared principle of reason and debate, rather than blind belief. With all the benefits AI brings, the challenge is this: how can we harness its promise of superhuman intelligence without eroding human reasoning, the cornerstone of the Enlightenment and of liberal democracy itself? That may be one of the defining questions of the 21st century. It is one we would do well not to delegate to the machine.

The Danish duo’s debut album Goodbyehouse, released on the cultishly adored label Escho, derives from a period when the pair’s lives were in a state of major upheaval, and comfort was in short supply. “We had fun – you can hear humour a bit on the album – and we went through some tough times, existential crisis, and you can hear that too,” says Theusen over a video call from her home in Copenhagen. Goodbyehouse became one of 2025’s runaway underground successes thanks to that emotional openness – as well as the duo’s canny blend of Dido-esque balladry, shoegaze haze and minimalist pop. When we speak, Thuesen and Strange have just returned home from their final tour dates of the year, a brief run that left them both ailing. “We get sick now after three weeks!” Strange says, laughing. “It was a lot easier when we were twentysomething.” They need to get used to it: 2026 includes an extensive Danish tour before a handful of shows with Paramore’s Hayley Williams and stops at Barcelona’s Primavera Sound and Denmark’s Roskilde festival. Snuggle is neither member’s first band. In his early 20s, Strange played in the acclaimed electronic soul band Liss, who were signed to XL Recordings. The four-piece broke up after the lead singer Søren Holm, died by suicide in 2021. They released their final album in 2022, after Holm’s death. “I was kind of at my lowest – I didn’t know what my music should sound like, if I should even make music,” he says. “That had been my life.” Thuesen has been a member of the indie-rock trio Baby in Vain since she was a teenager. The band “had this whole run where we had the hype, and we were signed to [big indie label] Partisan Records and toured a lot.” But the band “started to crumble” after Covid. She found herself at a crossroads, deciding, like Strange, whether to continue with music as her bandmates started to drift to other projects. Strange and Thuesen both ended up enrolling in Denmark’s Rhythmic Music Conservatory (RMC), where they met for the first time three years ago – despite both having previously been signed to Escho and having mutual friends. “We had these classes where we had to play music for each other, and it was an instant thing where we really liked what each other was doing, so we decided to try and jam,” says Thuesen. There was an emotional connection too, says Strange: “Some of the stuff we talked about when we met was having these similar experiences of losing a very good friend in your mid-20s – we were just talking in a very unfiltered way.” Many of the most hyped musicians of the 2020s – including the pop singer Erika de Casier, Henriette Motzfeldt (half of the electronic duo Smerz) and the experimental producers Astrid Sonne and ML Buch – have studied at the RMC, but Snuggle bristle at the idea that of a certain scene. “It feels like the school is getting too much credit [for the] wave,” says Thuesen. “It’s more like a coincidence that all these people that are getting attention now went to that school, and I don’t really like when you put the art too much in context with institutions. I think it takes away from what art can be and can do.” Snuggle’s success certainly transcends the sometimes overly highbrow discourse surrounding the Copenhagen scene (now so renowned that it has its own official ). The band recently received a DM on Instagram from a teenage girl in midwest America who said they made her want to pursue music. “It just made me so incredibly happy – when I was younger, I just wanted to go and get out there, feel the success, and [feel] hyped about the hype,” says Thuesen. “Now, it’s about these little things.”",Shaad D'Souza,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/i-was-trained-from-childhood-to-be-a-stickybeak-my-dads-philosophy-was-always-follow-your-curious-nose,I was trained from childhood to be a stickybeak. My dad’s philosophy was ‘always follow your curious nose’,2025-12-26T14:00:13.000Z,"Debra Oswald’s father taught her to be inquisitive about the world. As an adult she discovered that curiosity can help us endure whatever is happening hen I was 11 years old and expressed an interest in writing plays, my father was it – booking theatre tickets, driving me to Parramatta Library to borrow scripts and giving me a portable typewriter for my 12th birthday. Soon after, when my teenaged sister mumbled an interest in genetics, we all found ourselves in a university lecture hall for a public talk on the subject. My dad’s philosophy was “always follow your curious nose” and along the way, he was inspired to conduct his own research into theatre or genetics or whatever happened to be fascinating to us kids. Even if it was mostly through books, Mind Alive encyclopedias, and vicariously through his children, he was a stickybeak about the world. As an adult, I’ve continued this inquisitive family tradition. Arguably, it’s how I’ve made a living. One of the joys of a writing career is the excuse to be nosy. I’ve ridden around on police rescue trucks, done a Tafe certificate in asbestos removal, interrogated peach farmers, obstetricians and coroners. I’ve encouraged my own kids to follow up on any itch of curiosity. One of the delightful parts of being a parent is learning about areas your kids become interested in – in my case, I know more about blues harmonica music and Russian history than I ever thought I would. Now I have the same chance with grandkids, and it’s glorious. A four-year-old’s fascination with Egyptian mummies means we’ve made several visits to the University of Sydney’s Chau Chak Wing Museum (can recommend). When his little brother became obsessed with a baboon’s red bum in a storybook, we went down that curiosity path to find pictures and videos about baboons (can also recommend). Not every childhood obsession is meant to turn into a profession or a lifelong hobby. But that curious habit of mind hopefully carries on into adulthood. And in my experience, curiosity can make life more bearable and interesting. Recently I had a skirmish with breast cancer. It was small tumour, detected early (a “boutique” cancer). Trained from childhood to be a stickybeak, I was fascinated by the technology, by the weird physical sensations in the various procedures, by the thought sequences and gusts of emotion in my own mind. During tests and treatment, I would ask the medical personnel questions about their jobs. I enjoyed observing the rapport between the sonographer who was wielding the transducer over my breast while the doctor inserted a wire into me (would not recommend). Taking an intense interest in what was happening, around me and inside me, has helped maintain my sanity. I don’t want to sound glib about the weight and pain of bad stuff happening to people. But being curious offers different camera angles, and that can help us endure whatever is happening. I’ve always believed curiosity is much preferable to opinion (she wrote opinionatedly). Ask people questions about themselves and what fascinates them, then ask follow-up questions. You may well still loathe everything they believe, but at least it might be interesting. Better to elicit stories from someone than just bounce your opinions off their Teflon-coated opinions. And if, at your tense holiday gathering, any questions crop up about mummification techniques, baboon bums, friable asbestos, the October Revolution or diatonic harmonicas, I can recommend information sources that provide intriguing details. When our father died, my sister and I had to chuck out the Mind Alive encyclopedias (the pages had gone mouldy), but Dad’s spirit lives on as a family tradition – we all still “follow our curious noses”.

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/26/five-star-albums-you-may-have-missed-this-year,"Soul-baring ballads, alt-rock fury and neon-lit techno: five-star albums you may have missed this year",2025-12-26T14:00:12.000Z,"Valentina Magaletti drummed for her life, Sarz got hips swinging and Daniel Avery got slinky and serpentine: our writers pick their favourite unsung LPs from 2025 Towards the end of Tether, there is a song called Silk and Velvet; its sound is characteristic of Annahstasia’s debut album. Fingerpicked acoustic guitar and her extraordinary vocals – husky, expressive, elegant – are front and centre. The arrangement is subtle but not drearily tasteful: arching noise that could be feedback or a distorted pedal steel guitar, which gradually swells into something climactic before dying away. The lyrics, meanwhile, concern themselves with selling out: “Maybe I’m an analyst, an antisocial bitch,” she sings. “Who sells her dreams for money.” It’s a topic that speaks to Annahstasia’s turbulent music industry history: signed at 17 to a label that tried to mould her into a mainstream pop star, she quit and pursued a more singular vision. Tether acts as vindication, announcing the arrival of a strikingly unique voice. It slips from Slow’s seductive take on soul to the raging alt-rock of Believer, but every track has its author’s unique character stamped through it. These are superbly written, remarkably moving songs, delivered by a singer who knows exactly how to use her vocals to cut the listener deep: when to exercise restraint, when to express halting uncertainty, when to let fly with impassioned vibrato. The result is an album that feels intimate and revealing: the kind you don’t so much listen to as enter into a relationship with. There’s a tendency to single out prolific musicians as “hard-working”, though one of the joys of following Italian drummer Valentina Magaletti through the underground is how effortlessly and innately she races through different gears. This year she released a remix album of her excellent 2024 album Estradas with Afro-Portuguese producer Nídia, put out a mighty new EP with her abrasive trio Moin and collaborated with the writer Fanny Chiarello. Then there’s this wildly exhilarating record with YPY, AKA Japanese musician Koshiro Hino, also of Goat (jp), which highlights the delirious musicality of her playing as his synths and her filigreed attack become inextricable. You might very well think: “Thirty-seven minutes of pure percussion? No, thank you.” But even if you don’t know your Chris Corsano from your Kahil El’Zabar, Kansai Bruises is immediately arresting in its virtuosity, high-wire thrills and textural delight. The hyper detail of One Hour Visa feels like synaptic overload, Magaletti and Hino’s mind-meld swerving like an out-of-control sled down a slalom. You hear Magaletti yelping “yeah!” in the title track, and wonder how great and gruelling it must feel to flit from tuneful patter to drone-line rumble then hand-style patterned percussion in a matter of seconds, an electric run aptly characterised by Hino’s shooting sparks. Lantern Lit Run has a dazed swirl to its gait that feels like drunkenly blinking at a city’s bright lights; then it dissipates to the steamy hiss of hot springs. More of a showcase for Hino, Her Own Reflection makes his synths blossom through the rubble Magaletti strews with abandon. The gleeful aggression of Kansai Bruises is so overwhelming that it becomes oddly relaxing: another indication of Magaletti’s preternatural talent. Marriage as a grape plucked and crushed, a plane downed in an open field, a town patrolled by wolves: for her gripping third album, Californian folk musician Madison Cunningham calls on a host of haunting metaphors to describe falling in love at 17 and divorcing by 27. A record about rebirth, or “dying in reverse”, Ace shifts the focus from Cunningham’s celebrated, dextrous guitar work. Instead, she and her touring band harness elemental power from vast woodwind arrangements and slicing strings – all the better to capture the terrifying, breathless possibilities of starting over. “You say you know every mole and skin tag, like it makes you wiser to the person I am,” she sings, steely with new self-knowledge, on piano ballad Take Two. Cunningham’s previous LPs (including the Grammy-winning Revealer) used songwriting to search for clarity. But Ace, named after “the strongest and the weakest card in the pack”, finds the truth to be slippery, contradictory, two-sided. Grief and desire are circular on single My Full Name, while the album’s slow-burn finale Best of Us tackles the slippery slope that is faking it, just a little, until you’re faking it more than you’re not. What happens when the facade finally cracks? This stormy, career-best record holds the answer. Anyone with any interest in Afrobeats knows that the Nigerian producer Sarz has been an architect and alchemist of some of its best sounds, from Wizkid’s Come Closer to Lojay’s Monalisa. I’ve also seen him DJ at some of the best African music nights in London: not a realm he originally planned on venturing into, but one that naturally emerged from his production work as he wanted to learn how to influence the psychology of a crowd and get them moving. With his momentous, Black diaspora-surfing debut album Protect Sarz at All Costs, he lays a solid claim to the title of Nigeria’s most deft curator and enchanter of swinging hips. There are some of his usual collaborators here in Asake and Lojay, but there is also the Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa, French-Congolese singer Theodora and Cameroonian-American artist Libianca. They help him helm an incredible span of sounds: orchestral flourishes, traditional African percussion and futuristic afro-pop textured EDM. Like many ambitious projects by Afrobeats artists, Protect Sarz at All Costs is genre-fluid, encompassing amapiano, hip-hop, afroswing, 90s R&B and alté. The result is a potpourri of different moods: one of my favourite tracks, African Barbie, is sensual and fierce, while Getting Paid takes its cues from luxury rap about the spoils that a business in music and entertainment confers. With Sarz’s presence stretching beyond the African continent to fill dancefloors across the world, his debut doesn’t mark an arrival, but an assertion of his prodigious talent. Daniel Avery’s Tremor is an album I feel like a fine film of grease on my skin, or the thin, constricting sensation of nylons pulled tight over my face while I do crimes. It’s an album that sounds like furtive behaviour, full of dark, industrial sounds and brooding, lurking musical alleyways. The first time I listened to it, I was walking home after dark with my hood up against the drizzle. It made me feel as if I was up to absolutely no good (but was actually on my way home from book club). Avery gathered a community of interesting, understated voices around him to make Tremor and the result is a far cry from the accessible techno he produced in his youth: though it occasionally feints in that direction as it roils through genres, Tremor’s droning guitars and clipped live drums slink beneath breathily delivered lyrics; the only way you could call it techno is if you said it was something like deconstructed post-techno industrial noisecore, which, let’s not. If Nine Inch Nails hung out in Dalston for a bit, they might come up with something approaching this record. If Deftones played a show underwater, you might get something a bit like Tremor; a seething, serpentine album that seeps into being and lingers, goading you into mischief like the devil on your shoulder. Naples emerged in the mid-2010s amid a wave of dance producers making lo-fi house music (such as Delroy Edwards, Actress, DJ Boring and most of the LIES roster). Consciously or not, that loose scene seemed to be a bulwark against the shine of EDM. Since then, Naples’ work has only matured: 2023’s Orbs was spellbinding ambient techno, and the follow-up is richer still. It’s a more populist album than Orbs, with vocal samples, higher tempos and playful detailing such as the discordant jazz piano chords of Somebody, or the neo-acid squiggle running through Bounce that undulates the grid around it. Hi Lo is classic Basic Channel-style dub techno, as if swooping through mists on to a city-planet at dawn, while the title track still has that Germanic bearing but with a more golden-hour, late-afternoon light. Mushy, meanwhile, sounds like the kind of early 90s track that ex-ravers get misty-eyed about in YouTube comment sections. The highlight is Night: cantering along at 134bpm, it’s as if shards of digital light are hurtling past your field of vision. In a dance scene that lauds old-school legends and the latest hype-cyclists but can forget about those in between, it’s great to see Naples still steadily moving forward, iterating and improving his craft with every release. Lupu was a pianist whose beguiling sound world was allied to a mind of such penetrating musical intelligence that it sometimes seemed miraculous. He died in 2022; Decca, for whom he recorded exclusively for over two decades, released his complete recordings in 2015, but to mark what would have been the pianist’s 80th birthday, the company produced this wonderful surprise: six discs made up of unreleased studio sessions and BBC, Dutch and SWR radio tapes, dating between 1970 and 2002, of works that the Romanian pianist otherwise did not record. While there is more familiar Lupu territory (Mozart and Schubert) in some of the discs, much of the set is less expected. Lupu recorded little Chopin, but here is a thrillingly vivid performance of the B minor Scherzo, more uncharacteristic still is Copland’s Sonata, fierce and majestic, from the Aldeburgh festival in 1971, while Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition sees him making a rare venture into the Russian repertory; it comes from a 1984 Dutch broadcast, his tone noticeably rawer, almost strident at times.

Now its gaming academies offer a chance to earn a six-figure salary – if you make the grade Son Si-woo remembers the moment his mother turned off his computer. He was midway through an interview to become a professional gamer. “She said when I played computer games, my personality got worse, that I was addicted to games,” the 27-year-old recalls. Then Son won an amateur tournament. The prize money was 2m won (£1,000). He handed all of it to his parents. “From then on, they believed in me,” he says. Almost a decade later, Son, known professionally as Lehends, is a multiple champion in League of Legends, a competitive strategy game. He plays for Nongshim RedForce, a professional team backed by one of South Korea’s largest food companies. The trajectory of his career mirrors a wider reversal in how South Korea views gaming itself. In October this year, President Lee Jae Myung “games are not addictive substances”, a sharp break from 2013, when there was a to classify gaming as one of four major social addictions alongside drugs, gambling and alcohol. That shift has been accompanied by rapid growth. Between 2019 and 2023, the domestic gaming market expanded by 47% to be worth 22.96tn won (£11.7bn), with industry exports rising 41% in that time to (£5.6bn). The market accounted for nearly two-thirds of all Korean content exports, far exceeding any other cultural sector, including K-pop. Part of that ecosystem is esports: organised competitive gaming centred on professional leagues and teams. In 2023, the sector about 257bn won (£128m), a small share of the wider industry, but one that carries an outsized role as a showcase and marketing engine, shaping how games are promoted, sponsored and consumed. Korea now ranks fourth globally in gaming market share, behind the United States, China and Japan. For a country that once forced teenagers , the change is dramatic. Gaming is now treated as legitimate work and a strategic industry. The transformation has its roots in the late 1990s, when South Korea emerged from the Asian financial crisis and invested heavily in broadband infrastructure. Internet cafés, known as PC bangs, spread rapidly as informal social spaces. Around 7,800 operate nationwide today. By the late 2000s, professional matches of StarCraft, another strategy game, were filling stadiums. Broadcasting channels established formal leagues, and major corporations including Samsung, SK Telecom and KT began sponsoring teams. Today, esports-focused programmes exist at a dozen schools and universities, and many more institutions offer degrees related to gaming. The final stages of a major tournament were recently , with fans following players much like pop idols. At Nongshim Esports academy in Guro district, western Seoul, the training rooms are compact and starkly white. Teenagers and young adults hunch over their screens in near silence as coaches hover between desks offering quiet instructions. This is where the dreams are built, albeit for a select few. Along one corridor, rows of trophies and awards are displayed. There’s also a dormitory for professional players and a canteen overseen by a nutritionist. Twenty-two-year-old Roh Hyun-jun is on leave from his mechanical engineering degree. University, he says, is a backup plan. For now, he trains in hopes of becoming a professional League of Legends player. “When you play team games with five people, you really feel that sense of unity,” Roh says. “It’s not just me winning alone, but everyone moving in the same direction to achieve victory.” The academy, run by the same conglomerate that sponsors Lehends’ team, charges about 500,000 won (£253) for 20 hours of training a month. Evans Oh, CEO of Nongshim Esports, which operates the academy, says only about 1–2% of trainees go on to become professional players or secure related esports jobs, a conversion rate he says is “not that low, but not that high”. Since opening in 2018, it has produced 42 professionals. Training at such academies can resemble elite sport, with long days devoted to gameplay, video analysis and team strategy, alongside psychological coaching. well into six figures in US dollar terms through a mix of salaries, prize money and sponsorships. of students, professional gamer ranked fifth among desired jobs for elementary school boys. Careers, however, are short, often ending before 30 – a timeline further compressed for Korean men by mandatory military service. Lehends’ teammate Hwang Sung-hoon, who is 25 and known as Kingen, describes a profession that leaves little room for doubt. “If you’re not good enough, you have to give up quickly. It’s that kind of market.” Aiden Lee, secretary-general of League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK), the country’s top esports league, says South Korea’s dominance, evidenced by LCK teams , reflects the intensity of the competitive environment Koreans grow up in. “What makes the difference is competition and concentration,” he says. “Korean pro players can practise more than 16 hours a day. The amount of practice and focus is very different.” The government now frames its role as balancing growth with protection. Seven state-supported “healing centres” operate nationwide for young people considered overly immersed in gaming, offering consultations in partnership with hospitals. for youth players cap official training hours, in what officials describe as an effort to ensure healthy competition. Back at the academy, Roh, the trainee, remains focused. “I want to leave my name as the most famous pro gamer,” he says. “Since I’ve chosen this path, I want to do my best.”",Raphael Rashid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today we look at how the struggle to adapt to a dangerously warming world has become a test of global justice he record-breaking 252mph winds of Hurricane Melissa that devastated Caribbean islands at the end of October were made in Spain and Portugal during the summer was made 40 times more likely, while June’s was made 100 times more likely. has made one thing clear: global heating is behind today’s extreme weather. That greenhouse gas emissions warmed the planet was understood. What can now be shown is that this warming produces record heatwaves and more violent storms with increasing frequency. What we can do to minimise, or at least reduce, the risks to life from such events – as well as more gradual changes – is what climate adaptation experts think about all the time. The alarming consensus is that we are not doing anywhere near enough. The result is paid for in lives: floods and cyclonic storms across left hundreds dead at the end of November. The president of Cop30 in Brazil, André Corrêa do Lago, called for the UN climate change conference to be a “Cop of adaptation”. But the governments of the most vulnerable countries went home from Belém angry about an outcome that saw the , but with the deadline pushed back to 2035 and to make rich countries pay up. Even that total falls short of the overall that was agreed at Cop29 in 2024. The risk is that without international support, heavily indebted countries such as Jamaica become trapped, with resources that ought to be directed towards green energy and future-proofing being spent instead on coping with disasters. But the need for preparation is not limited to low-lying countries and those most affected by extreme heat and violent storms. This imbalance in climate programmes can be seen all over the world. Last month, a group of UK scientists organised what they called a “ ” in London in an effort to alert people to the scale of the climate crisis threat – and alarming underpreparedness. . Poorer countries, including the small island states whose existence is threatened by sea-level rises, have consistently argued that the rich nations whose historical and current emissions are responsible for climate heating must support them to adapt to the crisis, as well as to transition away from fossil fuels. Rightwing, nationalist governments in the west are extremely hostile to this idea – and to more broadly – even if their most vociferous objections are reserved for the phaseout of fossil fuels and net zero. But within wealthy countries, adaptation can appear more as a technocratic challenge than a political one. Policies regarding flood risks or increased resilience to high temperatures are not usually top priorities for voters – except when there is a disaster such as the floods in eastern Spain that led to the , in November. While the grossly mismanaged water industry is a live political issue in England and Wales, big questions about natural resources and the resilience of infrastructure sit outside the daily cut and thrust, with responsibility delegated to arm’s-length agencies and rarely touched on by party leaders. from the UK’s Glacier Trust and Climate Majority Project argued that charities and politicians should seek to change this, and promote an “action-oriented public understanding of climate risk”. All must recognise that adaptation cannot simply be left to market forces because the economics of climate risk make private finance retreat just as danger rises. The long, low-profit investments needed to defend communities from flood, fire and heat are not attractive to private lenders. It is the state that must build seawalls or insure subsistence farmers when the risk becomes too great. Leah Aronowsky, a historian of science at Columbia University, says that climate risk is everyday injustice made worse – and she is to argue that how we adapt is a political battle. One reason that adaptation receives so little attention is the sheer urgency of cutting emissions. In the context of warnings that the 1.5C target in the Paris agreement , mitigation – reducing or removing emissions – is the top priority. Discussing preparations for global heating can feel like a distraction or even an admission of defeat. But while it makes sense for climate campaigners to maintain the strongest possible pressure for emissions cuts, there ought to be scope to get ready for a hotter, more unstable climate as well. Under the terms of the UK’s Climate Change Act, the government is legally obliged to do so, and to regularly review its preparations. The UK’s Climate Change Committee will soon outline what a truly “ ” country should look like: flood defences that can withstand the storms to come, transport links built for a harsher climate, food and supply chains resilient to global shocks, and coastal communities protected rather than abandoned. Experts also want to ensure that the 1.5m homes that the government has pledged to build in England alone are fit for the future. In an era of polarised attacks on net zero, such projects could help rebuild a shared belief in responsible care for the land. For the rich world, adaptation is prudent. For the poor world, it is survival. The latest UN is unequivocal: developing countries will need more than $310bn annually by 2035, yet received just $26bn in 2023. Catastrophic this year point to the growing need to accelerate climate adaptation. (NDCs) – country plans to tackle global heating – are meant to cover both emissions reduction and adaptation to climate impacts. But NDCs end up focusing mostly on cutting greenhouse gases and establishing decarbonisation pathways. That needs to change. , which came out of Cop16, need to be foregrounded. These put centre stage – and demand real plans, real finance, real justice. They ask the question that really matters now: how do vulnerable nations survive a warming world that emissions cuts alone can’t stop?",Editorial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shearwater is a research outpost, home to the global seed vault created as a bulwark against climate catastrophe and to colonies of seals, penguins and birds. For eight years, Dominic Salt and his children have lived there, but dangerously rising sea levels mean that they, and the vault, will shortly be evacuated. Dominic cannot understand why Rowan has ended up on Shearwater, and Rowan is mystified by the absence of the scientists and researchers, about whom the family are tight-lipped – and the island’s communication centre has been mysteriously sabotaged, isolating them still further. McConaghy writes beautifully about the natural world and expertly ratchets up the tension, as mutual suspicion increases and secrets are gradually revealed. This is a powerful read that encompasses not only grief, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of disaster, but also survival strategies and their concomitant moral dilemmas. When chaotic kleptomaniac Caitlin returns to her small Irish home town after the death of Kathleen, the mother from whom she has been estranged for many years, she’s pleased to be welcomed by the Branaghs, friendly neighbours she remembers from childhood. Less pleasant is being forced to confront past traumas, including the disappearance of her nine-year-old friend Roisin from a local wood 20 years earlier. Caitlin feels guilty about this, as does Roisin’s older sister Deedee, who is sure that Caitlin is still hiding something. Having joined the garda to find answers that never materialised, Deedee is drinking heavily, making poor decisions and jeopardising both her job and her relationship, and both women desperately need closure … This impressive, if bleak, debut is a slow-burning but well paced story of shame, guilt, misplaced loyalty and generational trauma, the conclusion of which, once one is in possession of all the facts, has a heartbreaking inevitability. Winner of the Ngaio Marsh award for best first novel, New Zealander McDonald’s debut is set in a small town in South Otago. Eleven-year-old Tippy Chan has had a tough year after the death of her father, and when her mother goes on a Christmas cruise, leaving her in the care of her uncle Pike and his new partner Devon, she’s not sure what to expect. Pike, who fled to Sydney many years earlier, and Devon, a fashion designer, arrive in a blizzard of sequins and exuberance, but what begins as a jolly romp against a background of queeny flamboyance and inappropriate innuendo – which, mercifully, sails over our young narrator’s head – darkens when one of Tippy’s teachers is found dead in suspicious circumstances. Uncle and niece being devotees of the Nancy Drew mysteries, they feel compelled to investigate, and the Nancys detection club is born. As well as a compelling mystery, this is a funny and touching account of family, friendship and loss, with a trio of appealing characters at its heart. American journalist Kashino’s first novel is a satirical thriller about the housing market, set in Washington DC. PR executive Margo and her lawyer husband Ian are desperate to move out of their cramped flat and buy a home where they will be able to start a family but, demand far outweighing supply for the type of property they desire – colonial style in a good area, the very benchmark of Successful Adulthood – they keep losing bidding wars. When Margo, the cynical but sensitive product of an unstable childhood, hears of a perfect house about to be put on the market, she decides to persuade the owners into a private sale. What begins with stalking and befriending under false pretences soon escalates, and events spiral out of control as Margo becomes increasingly deranged in pursuit of her life goals. Dark, funny and inventive, this is an ingeniously entertaining take on millennial anxieties. More dirty dealings in the world of property, this time among the estate agents themselves. Your Every Move is set in London, where Sterling & Co sell houses that would attract the highest band of mansion tax to the uber-rich.

https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/26/its-all-about-love-how-a-swiss-photographers-intimate-honeymoon-pictures-caused-a-scandal,‘It’s all about love’: how a Swiss photographer’s intimate honeymoon pictures caused a scandal,2025-12-26T07:00:05.000Z,"René Groebli took portraits of Charlie Chaplin and Walt Disney and pioneered new modes of photography. But it was his tender, erotic pictures taken in a Paris hotel room in the 50s that really caused a stir n 1952, two young honeymooners checked into a small hotel in Montparnasse. An everyday story in the City of Light, perhaps. But the Swiss photographer René Groebli and his wife, Rita Dürmüller, spent their time in Paris cocooned in their room producing a series of photographs – sensual, intimate, enigmatic – that would first shock then beguile viewers, works that can now be seen in a new exhibition in Zurich. In the honeymoon pictures, Groebli’s camera traces Dürmüller’s movements – as a shirt drops from her shoulders, the turn of her neck – which, he explains, was a deliberate “artistic approach not only to intensify the depiction of reality but to make visible the emotional involvement of my wife and of me.” Dürmüller is often nude, but not solely, and never explicitly posed. It is clear that she is playing with her husband, that this is fun. And we explore their shared space: the bed curved like a cello, the windows with their opaque lace curtains. There is one graceful snap of Dürmüller hanging up her laundry like a ballerina at a barre. By today’s standards the shots are sweet. But in 1954, when they were first published in book form, they were scandalous, leading to critical letters being sent to photographic journals and damning editorials written in newspapers. The final photograph in the series featured Dürmüller’s hand, complete with wedding ring, dangling over the edge of the bed holding a cigarette. Since Groebli’s book did not specify that he was married to his subject, some viewers saw this as depicting an extramarital encounter. Now 98, Groebli is sanguine about the mid-century response. “I wasn’t really surprised by the reaction of the media,” he tells me from his home in Zurich. “In those days only artists and people acquainted with the arts were used to nudity. was not commonly perceived as an art yet and photographs of nudes were associated with pornography rather than with artful, tender erotic poesy. It was therefore not surprising that, prejudiced by common perception, the poetic photographic essay could hardly be judged by its artistic value.” He responded by defining the series himself. “I reacted with the title The Eye of Love. It puts into words what the photographic essay is all about: love. It is not about voyeuristic sex, it doesn’t exhibit my wife as an ‘object of desire’,” he says of his spouse, who died in 2013. “Rita loved to create the images when we took those pictures. She took an active creative part in posing and composing. One may sense, while looking at these photographs, that she felt absolutely comfortable and, hence, acted perfectly natural. She was not an actor, but an artist helping to create scenes. The pictures are the result of a collaboration in perfect harmony.” Groebli was born in 1927 in Zurich, where his father was a procurator. In his late teens, he apprenticed with the Swiss photographer Theo Vonow and briefly studied at the Zurich School of Applied Arts under Hans Finsler, whose rigid, geometric style of photography Groebli rejected for a more fluid approach. Those interests informed his subsequent studies in film and a period training as a documentary cameraman. In the late 1940s, Groebli published his first photo-essay, Rail Magic, which followed the progress of a steam train as it barrelled from Paris to Basel. Its real subject was speed, its approach impressionistic: steam consumes the sidings, drivers lean into the wind. There is urgency in every frame. From the very beginning of his career, Groebli eschewed the cool gaze of the new objectivity movement popular in His early shots of trains, merry-go-rounds, dancers and bicycles echoed the work of , who had captured a similar whirlwind of pistons and wheels during la belle époque. But where Lartigue’s pictures are zany, Groebli’s are poetic. “My life as a photographer is all about movement,” he says. “I took my first photographs visualising motion in 1946 and there was no influence from other sources. With respect to Lartigue, it must have been around 1965 that I came across his pictures for the first time. I never met him personally.” Were there subjects that were simply too fast for his shutter? “Of course, there were extremely fast subjects”, he says. “But in the majority of instances, I intentionally chose the appropriate shutter speed that would provoke blurring or streaking effects.” In 1951, he married Dürmüller, a graduate in painting from the Zurich School of Applied Arts, and the couple went on their belated honeymoon to Paris the following year. Groebli describes his late wife as “not only lovely but in all respects an inspiring woman.” While initially criticised as being sexually overt, The Eye of Love series was later championed by the American photographer Edward Steichen, who invited Groebli to participate in The Family of Man, the landmark 1955 exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. Groebli went on to work in photojournalism, advertising and design, took portraits of Charlie Chaplin, Robert Frank and Walt Disney, and in the 1960s pioneered new modes of psychedelic colour-saturated photography using filters and selective dye transfer. “Mere naturalistic colour-photography did not satisfy my desires as an artist for long,” he says. Over the course of seven decades, he has seen his medium change immeasurably. “Smartphones have made photography a general public asset. Hence the world is flooded with myriads of pictures daily. A few decades ago, photographers were either professionals or educated enthusiasts,” he says. “As to the future: while analogue means of manipulation were rather limited, [they] expanded through digital photography. And they are definitely exploding with AI. The main issue is and will be to distinguish photographs from pictures generated by AI.” The Bildhalle exhibition presents an oeuvre shaped by experimentation. But Groebli’s most personal works remain those pictures of Dürmüller, taken more than 70 years ago in a Montparnasse hotel, compositions fixed in period and place, yet timeless and universal. And authenticity is perhaps the key factor to their enduring appeal. The viewer believes in the emotions exhibited. As Groebli explains: “I still see, as I did in the early days of our relationship, her love for me and my artistic work, and my love for her.”",Christian House,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The [Pentagon] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come … Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!” Nigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that the US strikes, which came after Trump had locked the countries in a diplomatic dispute when he of failing to stop Christians being killed in the country, were “part of joint ongoing operations”. Trump said on Friday that a US military strike targeting Islamic State militants in was originally supposed to take place on Wednesday, but he ordered that it be delayed by a day. “They were going to do it earlier,” Trump told Politico in an interview. “And I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present.’ They didn’t think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.” Nigeria is officially secular and its population is almost evenly split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn attention from the religious right in the US, which has framed it as persecution, and Trump’s supporters broadly welcomed the strikes. Nigeria’s government has pointed out that armed groups target Christians and Muslims. on Friday. He said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for 19 minutes, then called the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, to get his go-ahead, before speaking to Rubio again for another five minutes. “We have been working closely with the Americans,” Tuggar said. “This is what we’ve always been hoping for, to work with the Americans, to work with other countries, to combat terrorism, to stop the death of innocent Nigerians … It’s a collaborative effort.” Command said the strikes in Sokoto state had been carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities. An earlier statement posted on X and then removed said they had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries! “I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.” Trump positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in the 2024 US presidential election, campaigning on a promise of extricating Washington from decades of “endless wars”. However, the first year of his second term in the White House has been notable for a number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, as well as a Neither the US nor the Nigerian authorities have said if anyone was killed in the airstrikes. Asked if there would be more, Tuggar said: “You can call it a new phase of an old conflict. For us it is something that is ongoing.” Residents in the Sokoto village of Jabo, where the strike hit, said there had been no casualties and that security forces had cordoned off the area. Some in the village described panic and confusion as the US missiles hit. “As it approached our area, the heat became intense,” Abubakar Sani told the Associated Press on Friday. “The Nigerian government should take appropriate measures to protect us as citizens. We have never experienced anything like this before.” Sanusi Madabo, a farmer, said the sky glowed a bright red for hours from what he learned only later had been a US airstrike. “It was almost like daytime,” he said. US planes conducted surveillance missions over the region earlier this month. It is believed they used an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a base. Forests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of Islamic State – Sahel Province, known locally as Lakurawa. Some analysts say the IS branch started when a group of herders joined together to fight bandits in the absence of state support. The state is mostly Muslim. For residents of Sokoto, the US strikes brought back memories of when the Nigerian air force just an hour away from Jabo on Christmas Day last year. The villagers received compensation only five days ago, according to the air force’s , which said 13 civilians had been “unintentionally killed” and eight injured. Clashes between Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of Nigeria have been aggravated by ethnicity and religion but their roots lie in competition for land and water. Priests and pastors have increasingly been but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination. Tuggar said the operation was about “protecting Nigerians and innocent lives”, not one religion or another. “The president emphasised yesterday, before he gave it the go-ahead, that it must be made clear that … it is a joint operation,” he said. “It is not targeting any religion, nor is it simply in the name of one religion or another.” A day before the Sokoto strikes, a Christmas Eve suicide bombing at a mosque in north-east Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 seriously injured. The Nigerian army attributed the attack to the jihadist group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the region for almost two decades, mostly separate to the violence in the north-west. There have been almost 6,000 incidents of violence in Nigeria in 2025, about half of them attacks targeting civilians, according to , a non-profit conflict monitor. The state of Katsina, another Muslim-majority state two states to the east of Sokoto, had the highest number of incidents at 706. Sokoto had the fourth highest, 353.",Rachel Savage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/ashes-australia-england-cricket-fourth-test-boxing-day-two-report,England survive MCG mayhem to break Ashes drought in Australia with win in fourth Test,2025-12-27T06:57:23.000Z,"Crawley, Duckett and Bethell help set up win inside two days Stop press. Hold the back page. Drag out the dusty bunting and book three more nights in Noosa. England’s men have won a Test in Australia for the first time in nearly 15 years, chasing down 175 to win by four wickets and prevent an Ashes defeat from becoming a whitewash. Granted it was not a live victory, England merely dragging the scoreline back to 3-1 and doing so courtesy of a two-day heist on a pitch that made batting a lottery. But given the ordeal of this tour, and that grim run of 18 Tests without a win on Australian soil, it was not insignificant either. Though robbed of three days’ play, their supporters could finally crack a smile. The moment came at 5.24pm when four leg byes deflected off Harry Brook’s pads and meant the target had been wrapped up inside 33 overs. Zak Crawley, 37, and Ben Duckett, 34, got things off to a flyer, while Jacob Bethell showed his composure – and some impishness – to top-score with 40 from 46 balls. Even with a late wobble, it was a pretty clinical chase. of the series – a first since 1896 – this was . But for all the anger about the grassy surface prepared by Matt Page it was not dangerous. The issue, chiefly, was the lavish sideways movement that it offered two attacks with a strong command of the wobble-seam ball. It made the run chase all the sweeter for a team that has been hit with a barrage of criticism for poor decisions made on and off the field. Whether it changes the complexion of this failed tour remains to be seen. For Ben Stokes and Joe Root, who were seen sharing a hug at the end, it at least produced the Test win in Australia both feared might never happen. England had to dig deep, their bowlers rolling Australia for 132 in their second innings by 2pm on the second day despite losing Gus Atkinson to a hamstring injury early on. Brydon Carse claimed four for 34, Ben Stokes three for 24. And Josh Tongue, fresh from 24 hours earlier, picked up two for 44 to finish as player of the match. Australia rather lost their way with the bat, resuming 46 ahead in the morning, but losing six wickets before lunch as they became increasingly spooked by the conditions. Marnus Labuschagne had the most reason to be, rapped on the hands twice before edging Tongue low to slip. The most telling blow was Carse bowling Travis Head for a promising 46, the ball borderline unplayable as it jagged off the seam and kissed the top of the stumps. The loss of three for six in two overs before the break soon gave rise to thoughts of an achievable target for England, with Usman Khawaja among the most culpable when he holed out to long leg for a duck. With Jhye Richardson the last to fall – curiously handed the strike by Steve Smith, who finished 24 not out – it meant Australia had lasted 79.5 overs in their two innings – the fastest they have twice been bowled out since Brisbane in 1928, when a young Don Bradman made his debut. The target was never going to be a breeze, not least given it would need the highest total of this absurdly short match. Kudos to Duckett, who swung hard, rode his luck and put on 51 with Crawley inside seven overs. , these early exchanges dulled the seam on the Kookaburra and eased batting conditions a fraction. Much like Brook’s top score of 41 the previous day, this was not a surface to dig in on, but rather to show clarity and an intent to score. England also mixed things up, using Carse as a pinch-hitter at No 3 after Mitchell Starc had castled Duckett with a yorker. It did not. pay off, returning just six runs, but it pushed Will Jacks down to No 9 for insurance. Already up and running with an early straight six off Michael Neser, Crawley found support from Bethell and a precious stand of 47 runs developed. Though fresh air was met on plenty of occasions, and streaky edges dropped into gaps, there were some classy shots too, such as Bethell on-driving Scott Boland for a crisp four to get his innings moving. Boland prised out Crawley lbw after tea to make it four down with 63 runs required and Bethell creamed one to cover still 38 short of the target. When Root was trapped lbw by Richardson for 15, and Stokes edged behind off Starc, there were 10 runs to get, four wickets in hand. Rather than return to the dressing room, Stokes stood on the boundary’s edge fearing a late twist, only for Brook, Jamie Smith, plus some handy extras to take his side home. It was madcap, entertaining fare and a much-needed circuit-breaker for England during an otherwise failed campaign. But it was also hard not to feel for those who had bought tickets for the remaining days of a Test that is supposed to be one of the highlights of the Australian summer.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/27/jobsplus-community-project-unemployment-work-teesside-stockton,‘They can open doors’: the community-based project helping people into work in Teesside,2025-12-27T12:00:37.000Z,"Stockton’s JobsPlus is a pilot scheme with caseworkers who connect individual people with potential jobs, providing direct financial help where necessary e’ve had quite a few people on the estate get jobs,” says Bryan Stokell, who found work as a full-time security guard thanks to Stockton-on-Tees’s JobsPlus project. The 47-year-old father has since become a “community champion”, encouraging his neighbours to enrol. “It got to the point where even my little boy was coming home and saying, ‘my friend’s mam and dad are looking for work’,” he grins. “They [the project] have a lot of contacts, they can open doors into places.” Stokell has had health problems, and was struggling to find a suitable role before his caseworker, Khialah Wilson, helped him with his CV and job applications. This is one of 10 JobsPlus schemes. It covers the adjoining Primrose Hill and Newtown estates in Stockton, on Teesside, an area with a proud railway history but bearing the scars of deindustrialisation. The pilots – running against the – are in areas of predominantly social housing across England, from Penge in south London to Wirral in Merseyside, with backing from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). They are modelled on a US scheme, which was first tried in 1998 and initially ran for five years. it was possible to trace a positive impact on the earnings and employment of residents across generations. The research suggested children living in three JobsPlus areas, in Dayton, Ohio; Los Angeles, California; and St Paul, Minnesota, where the scheme was fully implemented went on to earn $2,706 more than their counterparts in similar areas. Key aspects of the “hyperlocal” approach include saturating a small geographical area with employment support, providing direct financial assistance and incentives, and involving the local community. With social tenants more than three times as likely to be lone parents and twice as likely to be disabled as the wider population, help is provided as close to home as possible. In Stockton, this means sessions being held in the Newtown community resource centre: a former school, busy with other local facilities, including a nursery and a youth group. The community champions gather weekly at Nancy’s diner here to chat through ideas over dinner. Wilson stresses that caseworkers stay in touch with their clients, providing moral support even after they find a job. “A lot of my work support customers still come in to see me face to face, even though they’ve signed off on the programme … I’m like, ‘I’ll put the kettle on’.” The community-based nature of the scheme reflects in an area – the trusted local connections – is good for economic growth. Pat McFadden, who has taken over from Liz Kendall as work and pensions secretary since JobsPlus was launched, has signalled a particular focus on youth unemployment and inactivity, including chaired by the Blair-era minister Alan Milburn. JobsPlus takes a place-based approach, rather than being tailored to a specific age range; but with unemployment rising across the UK, hitting a four-year high of 5.1% according to the latest data, its proponents argue it is one tool that could help. For 63-year-old Yaw Botwe, who was spending £15 a day on Ubers to get himself to work, the JobsPlus approach meant connecting him to an employer closer to home – Morrisons – and buying him a bike to get there. “It’s cleaning: it’s a nice job, we clean the floor, we pick the cardboard, the plastic. We are inside. This is the first time in my life I’ve got a job that my heart liked,” he says. Megan Steel, 19, who had studied childcare at college but did not want to pursue it as a career and was struggling to find employment, got intensive help with her CV and applications. “She’d come in twice a week, and we’d sit there for a full hour at least, sometimes a lot longer, and first we worked on your confidence, didn’t we? We built you up a bit,” her caseworker, Jade Green, tells Steel. When an invitation for an interview at the local casino came in late one recent Friday, Green stepped in. “I met her outside Tesco and I gave a voucher and said, ‘get yourself kitted out’ because I want her to feel confident,” she says. Steel got the job. “It’s helped me a lot,” she says. Young parents Leia Cuskern, 21, and Thomas Courtney, 18 – a care leaver – have also signed up. Cuskern has been signposted to the jobcentre, with her caseworker, Lyndsey Henry, scheduling an hour-long appointment for support with finding childcare for their 13-month-old daughter, Lily-Rose. Part of the JobsPlus recipe is to bring together resources that are already available but may be hard to access – whether training, benefits advice or connections to local employers. “Everything is done within the community, so that they don’t have to venture out as much – sometimes it’s about building their confidence,” says Henry. Courtney, the young dad, who lives with his partner on the estate, is keen to pursue a career in market management after completing a work placement with the local council under a separate employability scheme. With the help of the JobsPlus caseworkers, he plans to study for a diploma with the National Association of British Market Authorities. “I’ll go through a lot of processes, a lot of tests, and then after I go through that I get a diploma in market management, and then hopefully after that I can get a market manager job,” he says. “It’s running the whole markets,” he enthuses. “Taking rents, looking after the markets, making sure everyone feels OK while they’re on the market.” Another happy customer, Jacquie Brown Fowler, describes herself as “the crazy lady who had eight children” – now aged from eight to 28. Hitting a low patch after losing a previous job, she found regular phone calls with her caseworker helpful: she now has a job as a cleaner and lunchtime supervisor at her younger children’s school, and has completed a qualification in food hygiene. “I met lovely Khialah, who lit a lightbulb moment in my head,” she said. One of the unusual aspects of the scheme is that after eight weeks’ paid employment participants receive a £400 bonus. Botwe says he will use it to buy presents for his grownup daughters. As well as encouraging people to sign up, Suzanne Halliwell, the head of care and support at Thirteen Group, the housing association leading the pilot here in Stockton as well as being the landlord for many properties on the two estates, says the payment can help tide clients over the difficult transition between benefits and paid work. “Because of the way universal credit works, you’ve quite often got a period where it’s a bit of a hit and miss situation.” The Learning and Work Institute (LWI) is overseeing the implementation of the 10 pilots and conducting a full evaluation. The latest data shows that since the launch in summer 2024 more than 1,000 people have signed up with one of the JobsPlus teams, with more than 270 finding work. An interim assessment in September found that three-fifths of those who had found jobs through the scheme had hit the eight-week milestone, triggering the £400 bonus. Alongside £2m of support from the DWP the pilots are being part-funded by a charity, the Youth Futures Foundation. But as it stands government funding will run out next March. “This model is showing real promise to transform neighbourhoods and we look forward to watching it progress,” said Stephen Evans, the LWI’s chief executive. For the moment, though, the caseworkers in Stockton and the nine other projects are awaiting news about whether they can continue the project beyond March. Wilson, whose infectious enthusiasm keeps her crew of community champions coming back, says: “Fingers crossed, because I absolutely love it.”",Heather Stewart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This drama about a terminally ill woman embarking on an erotic odyssey was so funny and sad and true and daring. There has never been anything like it on TV.

Here are the best games you weren’t playing this year Have you ever wanted to romance your record player? Date Everything! offers players the chance to develop relationships with everyday objects around your house, in a fully voiced sandbox romp featuring over 100 anthropomorphised characters. Wonderfully meta; you can put the moves on the textbox, or even “Michael Transaction” (microtransaction – get it?) himself. A raucous debut by indie studio à la mode games, Sorry We’re Closed is a survival horror where the monster is love and the dungeon is a dingy London neighbourhood. Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. The trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Blippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric.

Just a chill bike-racing game where your ride is possessed by an ancient speed spirit. Wheel around a soothingly minimalist island of cycling obsessives, picking up new swappable bike parts and blasting past local gangs of racers on downhill courses. Uncomplicated, good looking and thoughtfully put together. Powerhoof’s excellent pixelated point-and-click game teases its dystopian plot throughout, mixing influences such as The Thing, Michael Crichton’s Coma and Total Recall. It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. While the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart. Set in an overgrown and misty American deep south, it stars Hazel, a young woman thrust into the aftermath of a hurricane and forced to battle the evil manifestations of deep-rooted sorrows. Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery. Your task is simple in the brilliantly silly Skin Deep: save a bunch of talking cats from marauding space pirates. The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes. Like Metal Gear Solid meets a Looney Tunes cartoon, the pleasure here lies in pushing the game’s miniature sandboxes to their slapstick limit. Casting you as a knight with a hoverboard, Sword of the Sea is a mystical journey through a desert which roils like an ocean.

Shakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant. with the immediacy of Streets of Rage, this colourful co-operative caper is an endless delight. As you roam Talamh’s lived-in fantasy world, this roguelike rewards you with satisfying new powers and beguiling side quests. With precise combat and varied movesets, Absolum adds some much-needed depth to the oft shallow beat ’em up genre. A co-op classic. If the prospect of a disgraced mobster tooling around small-town Japan accompanied by a giant depraved thumb doesn’t intrigue you, keep moving. But give Promise Mascot Agency some time and you’ll discover this compact open-world adventure is filled with chaotic charm. At its heart it’s a story of redemption, as you manage a gang of weirdo mascots and restore a dilapidated community, all while driving the best pickup truck in any video game. Here’s a fantasy role-playing game that’s happy to embrace elemental powers, even if it leads to pinwheeling chaos. In a world where fire attacks can spread uncontrollably and ice can lead to giant dragons dropping out of the sky as their wings freeze up, this colourful piece of whimsy offers fun that genuinely scales to your own imagination. Matt Newell’s hymn to photography is also a gorgeous investigation into the creative power of solitude and of paying attention to your surroundings.

Proof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. A game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. One for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants. Explore gothic Cumbrian locales to find artefacts, identify them via vague tomes, solve puzzles and occasionally divert the plot by giving a customer something other than what they wanted.

Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one.

In 40 years of cartooning I’ve never known such an anonymous government, where nobody recognises 95% of the cabinet (apart from Wes “face like a full Brazilian” Streeting). Whether this is down to Morgan McSweeney’s shenanigans or them keeping their heads down until the day the nightmare ends doesn’t matter: it’s a tragedy. The wasted comic potential to be milked from – dead spit for Death from a Brueghel painting – is a national disgrace. This year I have drawn Donald Trump and more than anyone else. They are not people I want to spend my time thinking about, or looking at – however nobody is beyond satire and they are both sufficiently unpleasant to make a good caricature. I loathe them, but I approach drawing them with curiosity and the eye of analysis. A caricature is as much about the person’s expressions as it is about their features, and while Trump’s face is very active, Putin’s is still: only his mouth seems to move, so I go for his glare. My aim is to ridicule, to decipher the grins and glares, in order to expose the motivation of those in positions of power. And although I don’t believe cartoonists have the power to bring down governments, I do think we can change the public’s perception of those in authority, and these perceptions can stick. Even so, I am sure it is damaging for the soul to draw Trump so many times – and I am planning to The year has felt a bit like watching repeats of old news broadcasts while being strapped to a dentist’s chair having all of one’s teeth removed. Everything felt painfully familiar, from the unimaginable horrors in Gaza to the continued bloodshed in Ukraine, the ascent of and “Donald Trump 2.OH-NO”. There were more revelations about (former Prince) Andrew and we even had a Labour government trying to bring back austerity. The tricky thing for cartoonists was to keep having something new to say in a year that often felt more akin to a recurring nightmare. However, cartooning remains a versatile and effective medium in order to try and capture the heated climate of our current times (both figuratively and literally); distilling the chaos into a single image and trying to squeeze out the odd laugh here and there where we can.

Now I’m a Guardian consumer champion. Reinvention is always bracing. My old life was spent wrestling airlines, insurance firms and energy providers intent on plundering readers’ piggy banks. My new life? Wrestling airlines, insurance firms and energy providers intent on plundering readers’ piggy banks. It is a comfort in this era of seismic shifts to know some things remain constant. You can bank on energy firms to with billing psychodramas and phantom accounts. Meanwhile, certainty is still the business model of insurers: many would say you can be certain that if you damage your car, or yourself, your provider will look for a reason to stall over your claim. It is an age-old tradition for airlines and accommodation providers to take your cash for a booking, but actual flights and actual beds sometimes appear to be considered an optional extra. This year, I have discovered where you can buy ; the mysterious reasons why guests at Travelodge can be in the banking sector (about two decades in Santander’s lexicon, apparently). – 33 weeks – and why some retired teachers At this time of year I like to acknowledge those organisations that have worked so hard to keep their customers at arm’s length, and to keep me in a job. Applause, please, for the winners of Anna’s dishonours awards 2025. Dead customers are so much easier to deal with than live ones. Perhaps that is why Three (slogan: “Live your best phone life”) suggested CF “ when she wanted to change the ownership of her mobile phone contract. CF’s account had been set up with him as the principal account holder because she was then a teenager at the time. Three’s customer service team does not have a process for this, but its bereavement service does. Helpfully, it suggested it mark her father down as deceased so it could oblige her request to make her the primary account holder for her own mobile phone. That could, Three warned, affect his credit rating, but it promised to tell credit agencies that he was still alive after the deed was done. Three later said it would review its processes a goodwill payment. Sex has bedevilled Guardian-reading holidaymakers. An elderly couple discovered that in their hotel room while they were at a Christmas gathering. The evidence? Condoms, knickers and a paper party hat in the bedroom. Premier Inn (slogan: “Force for Good”) apologised for “any inconvenience” and declared the case closed, before delicate questioning from the Guardian prompted a refund. Then there is Vrbo (“Where families travel better together”), which told a young family who that their complaint was “minor” and refused compensation until the Guardian stepped in. Everyone knows Ryanair has a heart of … solid granite. FB, a doctor, reached her departure gate late because she had . Ryanair (“Great Care”) refused to let her board the waiting plane and charged her a £100 admin fee to rebook. Could it not waive the fee as a goodwill gesture, given the circumstances? No it could not, it insisted, since it is its passengers’ responsibility to be punctual (even if it means not helping bleeding pensioners, it seems). A close race, this one. London’s Southwark council (“United to Serve”) deserves a shoutout for with damp, mould and insects for a year while it pondered how to address a leak elsewhere in the block. But the housing association L&Q (“Our vision is that everyone deserves a quality home that gives them the chance to live a better life”) went one step further when, with no warning, it for 12 days while it belatedly fixed a leak. Airbnb (“Belong Anywhere”) must share this with one of its hosts. When a 100-year-old oak tree fell , narrowly missing the occupants (who’d been having breakfast on the terrace minutes earlier), damaging the property’s roof and smashing their hire car windscreen, the host refused to refund their aborted stay. “You have chosen to remember the worry and trauma instead of celebrating a unique memory,” she told them. Airbnb was similarly sanguine. “We understand this may have caused some inconvenience to you,” it said, then closed their complaint – minus refund – and told them: “Keep safe. Stay healthy.” (It eventually issued a full refund along with a £500 voucher after our intervention). Where do you potentially face a court for ? The London borough of Ealing, which shields its residents from harmful forces without fear or favour. When a visiting driver confused an O on his car number plate with a zero and entered the wrong digit into a parking app, the council gave him the option of an £80 fine or legal action. Os and 0s are identical on car number plates and the driver had paid for his parking. That did not wash with Ealing, nor did government guidance on parking penalty enforcement, which requires councils to exercise discretion “sensibly and reasonably”. It insisted he cough up out of “fair consideration … to motorists who comply with all the parking regulations”. No one feels your pain like big business. In fact, it has adopted a platitude to encapsulate its empathy when it realises it has let you down. “We’re sorry for any inconvenience” can be rolled out when the civil service pension scheme managed by the outsourcing company Capita demands a retiree refund over 11 years, or Virgin Atlantic it cancelled. It meets the need when TSB , applies fraud markers to his name and causes the closure of his bank accounts. Inconvenient it is indeed when Airbnb because it has seemingly decided you are associated with the criminal underworld; or when Sky of a family whose house was wrecked by a gas explosion next door. This award is for the AA itself. “Join us on our journey” it invites. But one woman’s car after the AA towed it to an approved garage for repair. It was returned – only after she reported it as stolen – with a coating of bird dirt, a £70 penalty charge notice for a parking breach, and 15,000 extra miles on the clock. Reassuringly for other AA members, the association told me its relationship with the garage in question was now “under review”. Insurers have collectively earned this prize. Their response, when informed of a policyholder’s death, can be to for home and car cover. Why?

We subsist on a steady diet of lies, distortion and AI slop. Everything is getting stupider, including me. That’s why, when it comes to examining the year, I choose to reckon with nothing but cold, hard numbers. Here, then, is how things stand for me, statistically, at the close of 2025. Adult sons currently living under my roof. This is up sharply from 0% this time last year, and represents an abrupt reversal of a long-term trend: the outward migration of offspring. Books I’ve read this year. I didn’t start keeping a list on my phone to impress people. I did it because in September I suddenly realised , including the titles and authors’ names. When I wrote a column about this, someone suggested keeping a tally might help. The list itself proved to be a major investigative undertaking, which involved combing through online order histories, reviewing my book club’s WhatsApp and trying to judge from its position on the bookshelf whether I finished Moby Dick in early 2025, late 2024 or never. The total is provisional: I am reading a book I may well finish before midnight on New Year’s Eve. Don’t ask me what it’s called. Times I’ve told the single joke I wrote in 2025, to the total bewilderment of listeners. The only reason I didn’t tell it more often was because it requires the participation of a willing comic foil, and most people I know want no part of it. Me: “You know, they said I’d really like that spreadable Calabrian sausage that’s so trendy right now.” Me: “I can take it or leave it.” I have now reluctantly retired the joke, because it seems there just aren’t enough people who both know of the spreadable Calabrian sausage called , and also know that it’s pronounced in a way that could conceivably be mistaken for someone saying “and do ya?” There are, however, dozens of people who claim the J in is actually pronounced with a soft “zh” sound in Calabria itself, thus rendering my joke null and void. I know this because they all emailed me. Hours, of the 8,760 available in 2025, that I spent watching the YouTube channel of a man who calls himself . Steve specialises in showing you the many ways a flat roof can go wrong, and his channel was recommended to me by my own roofer, Mike, who thought it would help me understand some of the ways : shoddy installation, insufficient insulation, improper ventilation, all leading to a buildup of condensation. I guess he thought I would find it comforting, and to be honest, I did. People who have expressed delight at being mentioned in this column in 2025. This doesn’t happen very often, but I recently received a thank you card from a couple, saying they were thrilled to be mentioned, even though they didn’t actually appear as speaking characters – they were only unnamed lunch guests who didn’t turn up because it turned out . If they’re happy, I’m happy, even if I had to cook twice. People who have expressed fury at not being mentioned in this column in 2025. On this occasion, it was my fault. When my wife started plotting to in November, I mentioned every single member except one. I mentioned my wife, because her invidious scheming was central to the story. I mentioned Sasha, because she made a disparaging reference to me in the WhatsApp group; I mentioned Emma, because she said something in my defence; I mentioned Suzy, because book club was at her house that week; I even mentioned Fran for some reason, even though she didn’t come to book club. But I forgot to mention Nicola, and as a result she’s livid. If I had to make a prediction for 2026, it’s that I will be looking for a new book club.",Tim Dowling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/26/i-was-there-carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-french-open-final-tennis,I was there: Carlos Alcaraz’s comeback in French Open final is still hard to comprehend,2025-12-26T08:00:04.000Z,"Jannik Sinner dominated for three hours and 43 minutes, but the Spaniard somehow prevailed in an adrenaline-filled fifth set and all-time classic t was not until what appeared to be the dying moments of between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz that I realised it could be worth taking a photo of such a monumental occasion. This was, after all, the first grand slam final between the two players who seemed set to lead men’s tennis for many years to come. For three hours and 43 minutes Sinner had dominated Alcaraz and he earned three championship points while leading 5-3 in set four. Just before the Italian’s second championship point, I thrust up my phone and took a quick photo before my hand returned to my laptop, ready to file immediately an article that hailed his third consecutive major title and first triumph in Paris. Instead, it would take another hour and 46 minutes for a winner to be decided on Court Philippe-Chatrier in June. What unfolded was one of the greatest comebacks and matches as Alcaraz returned from the abyss to produce an astounding 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) victory. Even now, six months removed from that day, it is difficult to fully comprehend those events in Paris. For hours Alcaraz had been outhit and outplayed by his biggest rival and the then world No 1 in a major final. His dire unforced errors to fall 0-40 down at 3-5 in set four seemed to seal his fate. No one in the stadium believed a comeback was possible. No one except Alcaraz. First he dragged himself back to deuce, completely locking down his game, then he soared. By the time he closed out his service game for 4-5 with an outrageous running forehand winner, the energy inside the stadium had shifted and the crowd met the moment spectacularly. The stadium shook as most of the 15,000 present punctuated every successful point from Alcaraz with roars of encouragement and delight, to which the Spaniard responded by cupping his ears, pumping his fists and doing everything in his power to take advantage of their encouragement. Once the momentum had been wrestled back, it seemed as if he would not let go. Alcaraz methodically worked his way through the fourth set, then broke serve at the beginning of the fifth and maintained his advantage until he led 5-3. Had he calmly closed out the match at his first opportunity, this would still have been a classic. The final 30 minutes, however, are what truly established this contest as one of the all-time greats. Sinner, having spent the fifth set hobbling around the court, his energy destroyed, suddenly found a second, third and fourth wind all at once. He retrieved the break and the level of play ascended into the stratosphere as, driven by desperation and adrenaline after five hours of battle, both players swung with total freedom. Despite all that had already unfolded, the most memorable moment came in the form of the defensive slice Alcaraz struck deep in the fifth set as Sinner hunted his fourth championship point at 6-5, 30-30. No other player would have even put a racket on the ball, yet Alcaraz somehow turned that critical point around in one stroke. He ended lasering winners at will from every part of the court as he closed out his fifth grand slam title in a match tie-break to seal his biggest triumph. No matter how much more the 22-year-old achieves, this will surely be the defining moment of Alcaraz’s career. In the past he has been known to lose focus quickly in some matches, chasing highlight-reel winners and offering cheap unforced errors. He can be a master self-saboteur. However, in the biggest moments of the most consequential matches, Alcaraz has an unprecedented ability to lock in and produce his very best, most fearless tennis under suffocating pressure. There is no deficit he can not overturn. What was it like to cover such an event? It was a delight and horror in equal parts. The thrill at being able to watch such an encounter up close is obvious, but those emotions are paired with the tension that comes with trying to instantly make sense of a result that makes no sense. I ended up writing four reports: Sinner winning in four sets, Alcaraz winning in five, Sinner winning in five and then the final report. My brief panic after Alcaraz broke back for 5-5 was quelled only by the adrenaline that took over for me too. Most of all, it is a privilege to witness these moments. It was reasonable to conclude after the dominance of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer that it might take some time for the next legends to emerge. In their first grand slam final together, surrounded by so much hype and expectation, Alcaraz and Sinner showed the world that two such talents are already among us and the sport is now theirs.",Tumaini Carayol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/21/after-three-years-of-long-distance-my-partner-and-i-arent-sure-if-we-should-stay-together,"After three years of long-distance, my partner and I aren’t sure if we should stay together",2025-12-21T06:00:50.000Z,"These types of relationships can be challenging – you need to have an honest conversation about what you both want My first question was: what’s making you want to stay? I wonder if the relationship has run its course, but the time apart has made you feel that now you’re back together you have to make it work? You say it’s phenomenal when it works, but how long ago was that? Psychoanalytic psychotherapist and relationship expert (and author of a great book called Tell Me The Truth About Love) Susanna Abse’s first thought was that “it’s extremely challenging for couples to be in a long-distance relationship. Unless people have a strong emotional need to keep their sense of separateness and autonomy [and some people do], then separations are usually experienced as painful and disruptive, and over time can lead to a lessening of the attachment bond between a couple.” Abse went on to explain that “just as children display strong reactions to separations from their parents, couples frequently do too. Children who are securely attached to their parents protest in the face of separation and can turn away angrily when the parent returns. Parents can feel hurt by their children’s reaction, but hopefully respond by coaxing them into becoming close again. But between two adults it can be more complicated.” This is when anger and arguments come into play. “In my experience,” continues Abse, “longed-for reunions between romantic partners often end in a row, because the person who’s been left behind is not ready emotionally to reconnect, and the person who left becomes hugely disappointed at not being greeted with unalloyed joy! Although rows can feel challenging, they can also offer the opportunity to work through feelings, but instead of rowing, some couples repress their feelings and withdraw.” Abse felt you may be in the latter category: “To reconnect, you would have to step back into your relationship, acknowledging that it matters and exploring together how the separations really felt to you both. Perhaps you’ve both used your work as a refuge, which isn’t conducive to a close, committed relationship.” The last few years sound very intense professionally. I wonder if you both need to find some stability – regardless of being in a relationship – to acclimatise to where you’re at. I also wonder how balanced your relationship has been, when you were living together, during your separation and now. Did one of you compromise more or hold more of the power? Even now, in this disconnected period, you must have episodes where you get on better. When and where is this? Abse thought you’d benefit from a holiday together to “see how you feel if you make space for this relationship. You might discover what underlies your unspoken ‘decisions’ not to make your relationship your priority.” I think a holiday, or at least some time on neutral ground, would help you see what’s left of your relationship and what you want to save. I had an image of two people who are professionally very driven, but working in opposite directions personally. Some could help to tease out what you both really want, and if that does, indeed, involve each other.",Annalisa Barbieri,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now you’re talking The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. ometimes a little goes a long way. This is true for Tabasco on eggs, for fragrance in an elevator, for confidence in the karaoke booth, and it is also, I have belatedly realised, the secret of how to wear lace. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. All these years, I’ve been getting lace wrong by wearing too much of it. Killing it with overenthusiasm. Lace is beautiful stuff: delicate and romantic. Look closely at it and you will see tiny motifs and patterns, flowers and symbols, crafted in miniature like secret messages. Lace has drama: it is the fabric of marriages, funerals and christenings, after all. And it can switch vibes: white is chaste, red is raunchy, black is sophisticated. Lace has it all going on. But here’s the thing: when you overdo it, lace loses its lustre. Too much lace is slightly exhausting to look at. Unless you are walking up the aisle, head-to-toe lace can be overbearing. And because it looks a little old-fashioned, it can add years to your vibe. Nothing wrong with looking older, obviously. But, well, perhaps worth flagging. But a little bit of lace? Now you’re talking. A lace trim on a skirt. A lace camisole under a blazer. Lace tights or socks. The kind of lace that winks at you, like white fairy lights nestled in a tree. Which is much better than lace that blinds you with full-beam glamour. With restraint in mind, I have a few formulas to try. Top of my list is a lace edged skirt. Lace hits different if you place it at a less obvious place on the body. The black lace edging elevates this River Island skirt, adding drama and contrast. You won’t have to look far to partake of this outfit, because the lace-trim midi skirt is everywhere this season. My top recommendation is the from The White Company (£140) in chocolate with a generous froth of black at the hem. I’m keen on it because the dark colour and heavy satin make it useful, not just as a party piece, but also in the daytime, over tights and boots. Arket have a very pretty champagne-on-champagne (£85), with a flattering bias cut. The best partner for a lace-trim skirt is a top half that is matte, not shiny, and loose rather than tight, but it still needs to have a bit of oomph. A fluffy sweater or an oversized blazer both work well. Lace looks hot when it peeks out from underneath something else, and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out the psychology of this. The association between lingerie and sex is deeply ingrained in visual culture, a trigger that has an undeniable force – on women and men, and even on those who think they are too sophisticated for such things. It has an effect on the wearer, as well as the observer. Just by slipping a lace-edged camisole under a V-neck sweater, you feel a little friskier. If this feels a little too blatant for your taste, you can dial down the vamp by wearing lace where it doesn’t highlight your body. Sheer lace socks between jeans and a loafer look great. But my top tip is to add lace sleeves as an under-layer. A couple of years ago, I bought a long-sleeved, black lace bodysuit and it’s turned out to be one of the most useful pieces in my eveningwear wardrobe. I wear it under sleeveless dresses to make them work in winter – I hate being cold, but this is also handy if you don’t love your arms – or with a black tux and jeans. I have no idea where it was from as I cut the label out ages ago because it showed through the lace, but the It isn’t just kids who get overexcited at this time of year. It happens to lots of us. But lace works best when it feels like a secret, so resist the urge to overshare. It can make people want to lean in a little closer, to get a better look. Think of it as sartorial flirtation. And always leave them wanting more.",Jess Cartner-Morley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/27/my-cultural-awakening-jmw-turner-painting-cope-with-cancer-diagnosis,My cultural awakening: a Turner painting helped me come to terms with my cancer diagnosis,2025-12-27T07:00:30.000Z,"Fear and feelings of intense vulnerability caused me to retreat into my shell, until I saw myself in an unlikely feature in one of the British master’s prints y thyroid cancer arrived by accident, in the way life-changing things sometimes do. In May of this year, I went for an upright MRI for a minor injury on my arm, and the scan happened to catch the mass in my neck. By the following month, I had a diagnosis. People kept telling me it was “the good cancer”, the kind that can be taken out neatly and has a high survival rate. But I’m 54, and my dad died of cancer in his 50s, so that shadow came down on me hard. My eldest son was doing A-levels at the time, so we didn’t tell him at first. I felt as if I’d stepped across some irreversible Rubicon that you hear about happening to other people, but never imagine will actually come for you. After my diagnosis, I retreated. I barely left the house. My neck was bruised and swollen, as if I’d attempted some sort of gruesome Halloween makeup. I felt peeled-open and humiliated, as though strangers could look straight through my skin. Friends and family stepped up: my brother, who lives hours away, and I had this incredible chat for hours on a park bench in the sunshine. Still, I curled inward. It wasn’t until later that summer that my mum managed to coax me out for lunch and a trip to the Whitworth Art Gallery, in Manchester near where I live. There was a exhibition on. I knew his name and his work in the way most people do: big ships, sweeping seascapes of blues and golds. The grand stuff of someone else’s life. I didn’t want culture or fresh air or anything that required being seen, but I agreed to go to please her. The exhibition rooms were dark and quiet, lined with sepia prints. My mum moved from caption to caption, reading each one carefully. I drifted behind her, barely looking. When you’re waiting for more test results, for the next consultant meeting, for someone to tell you whether cancer has threaded itself further into your body, nothing penetrates. I was about to sneak off to the cafe  when one painting stopped me in my tracks. The print was Mount St Gothard, from 1808. In it, a pack horse stands on a mountain path, exhausted and pausing to catch its breath, with its head hanging low to the ground. The cargo on its back looks impossible. It was like looking in a mirror. It felt absurd, recognising myself in a horse on a Swiss mountain painted more than 200 years ago. But there I was. The horse was me. The overburdened body. The sense of not knowing how much more of the journey there was to go. For the first time in weeks, something cut through the fog. My feelings – the ones I’d been hiding, managing, downplaying so I didn’t worry everyone else – had shape. It was a moment of recognition. I had been managing everyone’s expectations around my illness, and seeing the horse gave me permission to let some support in. Yes, being able to sit in misery, darkness and fear was a necessary part of the process for me, but it couldn’t be done for ever. There’s now a 10-mile tunnel through the mountain in the painting: it takes 14 minutes by car. The horse must have taken hours. Months later, with two surgeries to fully remove my thyroid completed, and radioactive iodine treatment ahead of me marking my final medical hurdle, I’m finally starting to feel more like myself. I’m back at work, and I’m even ready to pick up the creative bits of life I’d dropped: the DIY; the craft-making; the messier, more joyful things that make me feel alive. It wasn’t the diagnosis, or the operations, or even the relief of curability of my cancer that marked a turning point. It was Turner’s horse. He made it to the top of the mountain carrying all that baggage, and was going to go back down the other side and have that pack taken off. And so will I.

Yotam Ottolenghi’s is the perfect way to be resourceful with leftover roast veg, as is Meera Sodha’s , a real treat of a dish that I enjoy year-round, and especially after the indulgence of December. Nigel Slater’s is another great addition to your leftovers repertoire, not least because it is a recipe that needs very few ingredients, very little work and is immensely adaptable. If I don’t have beetroot kicking around, I just leave it out. And if I have leftover comté instead of stilton, I’ll chop and stir that in instead. And then there are the puddings.

Nigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that he had had “extensive” phone conversations with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, before and after the attack. He said Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu, had given the “go-ahead” for the airstrikes. Tuggar did not rule out further strikes, describing them as an “ongoing process” that would also involve other countries. In an interview with the BBC, Tuggar insisted the strikes had “nothing to do with a particular religion”. He said the operation did not have “anything to do with Christmas, it could be any other day – it is to do with attacking terrorists who have been killing Nigerians”. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, warned of more strikes against Islamic State targets in north-western Nigeria, hours after the took action against militant camps in what Donald Trump has characterised as efforts to stop the killing of Christians. : “The president was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.

Stevenson Charles, 24; Yusuf Minor, 31; and Naod Yohannes, 25, are accused of escaping from the DeKalb county jail, located 15 miles (24km) outside Atlanta, on Sunday before being recaptured in The latest records provide further insight into how the men, who are all incarcerated for violent crimes, including murder charges, managed to escape and travel through several states. The rideshare driver told the FBI that the trio ordered a Lyft using a fake, female name, according to an affidavit, reported. Minor’s girlfriend allegedly helped the men order the Lyft ride, prosecutors said. When the driver attempted to drop the men off at their location, the men attacked her, wrapping a rope around her neck and dragging her to the backseat. The driver later told police that the men threatened to rape and kill her during the 10-hour trip to Florida. Charles, Minor and Yohannes then used the woman’s credit cards and bank information to rent a property in Miramar, Florida, a suburb of Miami. The men also used the driver’s car while in the area. Police tracked down the trio’s whereabouts using license plate readers, which allow law enforcement to search for wanted vehicles. All three men were later arrested. The driver was rescued from the rental property, records state, and was examined for injuries. The trio’s escape was discovered on Sunday during a standard security check. Temetris Atkins, chief deputy of DeKalb county, told reporters on Tuesday that the men managed to escape through an older part of the jail. “We repaired the area that was compromised, and we’re looking at other areas that are similar to that to fortify them to make sure that they are not compromised in the same manner,” Atkins said. Phone records searched by police following the trio’s escape revealed that one of the men had been in touch with people outside to help them avoid arrest after their escape. Minor and Yohannes are both serving life sentences for murder charges, NBC reported.

A bushfire continued to rage about 200km south-east of Perth on Friday morning, although nearby residents were no longer being urged to leave their homes. The risk alert was downgraded to “watch and act”, meaning Bannister, Wuraming and Boddington locals must monitor their surroundings and act quickly if the fire conditions changed and the situation worsened. Increased humidity and consolidated containment lines had improved fire behaviour, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services said. However, the bushfire remained uncontrolled and uncontained, and wind changes were expected. Dry, gusty winds and a Christmas heatwave fed the fire that was believed to have started at the Boddington goldmine. “We did have temperatures in the high 30s to low 40s across much of the south-west land division,” Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury told ABC News. “Unfortunately that, combined with dry, gusty, easterly winds, did really elevate that fire danger. “It shouldn’t be quite as hot [on Friday] as it was yesterday but there will still be some challenging conditions for firefighters battling any ongoing blazes in the landscape.” On the other side of the country, a monsoon trough has continued to bring showers, rain and thunderstorms to north-west and residents have been urged to remain alert for possible flooding. A monsoon trough in the north-west has continued to move along the coast, bringing showers, rain and thunderstorms to many parts of the already-soaked state. Residents in the adjacent Northern Territory areas are also bracing for intense rains and storms.

Not long after, Doumbouya announced a 36-month timeline for transition to civilian rule in the resource-rich west African nation on the Atlantic coast, shrugging off pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), which wanted a swifter return to democracy. His actions triggered widespread protests and criticism from opposition groups and civil society, most of whom doubted his vow not to personally run for office. On Sunday, 6.7 million eligible voters in Guinea will head to the ballot box for the first presidential election since the . Among the nine candidates are the former minister Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea and the former junta supporter turned critic Faya Millimono of the Liberal Bloc party. But thanks to a controversial referendum in September that led to the adoption of a new constitution allowing him to run and extending presidential terms from five to seven years, the clear frontrunner is Doumbouya. The opposition coalition Forces vives de Guinée has called his candidacy a betrayal. “The man who presented himself as the restorer of democracy chose to become its gravedigger,” it said in after Doumbouya officially deposited his intent to run with the supreme court. Political upheavals have been a recurring feature in west Africa, a region that has earned the moniker of “coup belt” after seven successful coups and several unsuccessful attempts since 2020. While has remained under the Ecowas umbrella, fellow juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, angered by its post-coup sanctions, have split from the regional bloc to form the pro-Russian Alliance of Sahel States (AES). If it holds, the Guinean election will be the first in any of the junta-run states since 2020. Within Guinea, many believe the general’s victory is a foregone conclusion, given his consolidation of power since ascending to the presidency and promoting himself to a general. Even now, the presidential race is notable not for those who are on the ballot, but for those who are not. The biggest opposition parties remain suspended, and their most prominent leaders have been detained, barred from running or – like the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, are in exile. Many say a pervades the country due to the junta’s crackdown against its critics, with several dissidents in jail. Conversely, Doumbouya pardoned the former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara who was given a 20-year sentence for his role in one of Guinea’s most serious human rights atrocities: the 2009 of protesters at a stadium in Conakry. The pardon, granted before the final hearing, prompted to the junta leader alongside families of victims, urging him to reconsider. That process is now in limbo. Ahead of the vote, Doumbouya has been accumulating goodwill.This month, the shiny new Simandou mine, which has the world’s largest untapped reserve of iron ore, was launched after nearly three decades of delays caused by political instability and corruption. Doumbouya’s government is touting the project as a bridge to prosperity for Guinea and a sign of incoming development, despite The election stakes are high: in the coming years, the multi-layered Simandou mine project – which also includes the construction of ports and a railway – is expected to transform the economy of Guinea, where half of the population lives on below $2 a day. Given existential concerns around transparency, many are waiting to see what the winning government does after the election. “Our salvation lies in a return to the [proper] constitutional order,” said Abdoulaye Koroma, a presidential candidate for the Rally for Renaissance and Development party.

In a joint statement, the two south-east Asian neighbours said the ceasefire would take effect on Saturday at noon local time and involve “all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas”. “Both sides agree to maintain current troop deployments without further movement,” their defence ministers said in a joint statement. According to the statement released by Cambodia’s defence ministry, “any reinforcement would heighten tensions and negatively affect long-term efforts to resolve the situation”. The two countries also agreed to cooperate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime. The agreement, signed by the Thai defence minister, Natthaphon Narkphanit, and his Cambodian counterpart, Tea Seiha, ended 20 days of fighting that have included fighter jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages. Even as the two countries held talks on Saturday to put an end to the skirmish, Cambodia reported that hit a site in the country’s north-west with an airstrike. Cambodia’s defence ministry said Thailand deployed F-16 fighter jets to drop four bombs on Saturday morning on a target in Serei Saophoan in the north-western province of Banteay Meanchey. a similar airstrike dropped 40 bombs on a target in Chok Chey village in the same province. Thailand’s military confirmed the Friday attack. Longstanding competing claims of territory along the border are in late July. Despite a shaky ceasefire mediated by the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, and backed up by pressure from the US president, Donald Trump, renewed combat erupted in early December. Thailand has lost 26 soldiers and one civilian as a direct result of the combat since 7 December, according to officials. Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths from collateral effects of the situation.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/diego-garcia-tamil-asylum-seekers-detainment-appeal-court-judgment,Court backs ruling that UK unlawfully detained Tamils on Diego Garcia,2025-12-16T17:13:50.000Z,"British Indian Ocean Territory commissioner’s appeal against decision last year rejected by judges in London Appeal court judges have backed a decision that dozens of asylum seekers were unlawfully detained on one of the world’s most remote islands, rejecting an appeal on Tuesday by the commissioner for the territory. Exactly a year ago, on 16 December 2024, a that Tamils who arrived on the island of Diego Garcia, a UK and US military base, after a shipwreck while they were trying to reach Canada to seek asylum, were unlawfully detained there for three years in conditions described as “hell on Earth”. The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) commissioner, , lodged an appeal in the territory’s court of appeal that the Tamils were not unlawfully detained on the island. But all four grounds of his appeal were rejected by judges in their judgment handed down in a London court. They found that evidence presented by the commissioner to support his appeal was “a highly selective exercise”. After the unlawful detention finding last year that was upheld on Tuesday, the British government could face a bill of millions of pounds in damages for unlawfully detaining more than 60 people for such a long period. Diego Garcia, halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia, has beaches of white sand surrounded by turquoise seas and dense forests of coconut palms. But the conditions for the asylum seekers were less favourable. They were accommodated in rat-infested tents, largely deprived of their liberty. Margaret Obi, the acting judge of the BIOT supreme court, found last December that they had been unlawfully detained. In her ruling, she said: “It is unsurprising that the claimants feel as if they are in a prison; that is exactly what it is, in all but name.” The Leigh Day solicitor Tom Short, representing some of the Tamils, welcomed Tuesday’s ruling: “The BIOT court of appeal’s ruling today that the commissioner unlawfully detained our clients for over three years in a fenced and guarded camp in conditions that amounted to a prison, is full vindication of the judgment made earlier by Ms Justice Obi after a full trial on the island of Diego Garcia,” he said. “The court has found that the commissioner intended to confine our clients – including 16 children – in this way and that he had no justification for doing so. His attempt to rewrite history has failed.” Simon Robinson, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, also representing some of the clients, said: “We welcome the judgment of the court of appeal dismissing the commissioner’s appeal on all grounds. Their unlawful detention was at a cost of £108,000 a day to the UK taxpayer. The substantial damages which will now be owed, add to these costs. These costs escalated because of the egregious delay by the home secretary and foreign secretary in agreeing to end their detention and relocate them.” A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said: “The BIOT commissioner appealed the initial judgment on several grounds. Diego Garcia has never been a suitable location for migrants, and this was a highly unique situation where safety was carefully considered throughout. “It is now for the BIOT administration to study the judgment carefully, and to consider next steps. However, this is clearly not the outcome we wanted.”",Diane Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ministry said on Friday that the measures – against 10 individuals and 20 US firms including Boeing’s production hub at St Louis in Missouri – would freeze any assets the companies and individuals hold in and bar domestic organisations and individuals from doing business with them. It comes after the Trump administration last week announced a package of valued at more than $10bn, including medium-range missiles and drones. It was the largest weapons sale in the history of the bilateral relationship. , which is that it must merge with the People’s Republic of China – something that the democratically governed Taipei rejects – has been a pinch point in its relations with the US, already worn thin over trade and tariff issues. Individuals on the Chinese sanctions list, including the founder of the defence firm Anduril Industries and nine senior executives from the sanctioned firms, are banned from entering China, the ministry added. Boeing produces fighter jets in St Louis, where more than 3,000 union workers over pay this year. Other companies targeted by the sanctions include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation and L3Harris Maritime Services. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Friday: “The Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations. Any provocative actions that cross the line on the Taiwan issue will be met with a strong response from China.” They urged the US to cease “dangerous” efforts to arm the island. The US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, although such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China. The eight arms agreements that comprised the total sale included 420 army tactical missile systems, or Atacms. The systems are similar to those sent to Ukraine under the Biden administration for its defence against Russia. The state department said at the time of the Taiwan arms sale that it served “US national, economic and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability”. “The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” various similar statements issued on each of the agreements said.",Anna Isaac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or was it that blue sky day in September 2001 when the planes hit the twin towers? These images from the last 25 years chronicle modern history in the making t the turn of the century there was a modest debate, mainly conducted on the letters pages of the newspapers – back then, still the prime forum for public discussion – as to when, exactly, the new millennium and the 21st century began. Most assumed the start date was 1 January 2000, but dissenters, swiftly branded pedants, insisted the correct date came a year later. As it turned out, both were wrong. The 21st century began in earnest, at least in the western mind, on a day that no one had circled in their diaries. Out of a clear blue sky, two passenger jets flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 and so inaugurated a new age of anxiety – a period in which we have lived ever since. The historian Eric Hobsbawm had already spoken of the short 20th century, which ran from the start of the first world war in 1914 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. It was followed by the long decade of the 90s, which came to resemble a contented pause, , until it was rudely terminated on that bright New York morning. The sight of it is still shocking. Nearly 25 years later, the portrait of an ash-covered sculpture, depicting a businessman and his briefcase, is as unsettling now as when it first appeared. Never mind that he was always a statue. The frozen Manhattan man, intact while everything around him lies in ruins, could be one of the petrified figures of Pompeii, a fully preserved emissary from a previous world: the world before 9/11. For a while, it seemed as if the new era would be entirely defined by the 11 September attacks and the response to them. The “war on terror” declared by George W Bush threatened to remake the globe according to the preferences of the nation that, after the expiry of the Soviet Union, was now a solo hegemon: the US. After the invasion of Afghanistan, which would see US troops installed in the country for two decades, came the US-­led conquest of Iraq and the toppling of – along with his statue – bringing death and devastation there and roiling both the Middle East and politics across much of the democratic world, including Britain. The slogan of the hour was “the clash of civilisations” and plenty believed that struggle would dwarf all others in the new century. The reverberations of Iraq were certainly felt for many years, whether in the Arab spring, the birth of Islamic State or the persistent threat of violent jihadism. But that struggle has had to share space in the 21st century with others. Not that that was obvious right away. At first, it seemed as if hope might edge out fear, that the new millennium might see change for the better. won a Nobel peace prize before he’d really done anything, in recognition of the optimism he stirred through his winning 2008 campaign, captured here in an image of the politician who, as he liked to remark, didn’t look like any other US president. Easy as it was to deride that feelgood sentiment as vibe than reality, there was a lot of it about. Science and technology, especially, were thought to be full of promise. For some, that meant the excitement of the Large Hadron Collider, the biggest machine ever built. For others, it was the prospect of instant forms of social connection, delivered by a new breed of young, nerdy men able to turn 1s and 0s into magic. Just look at the image here of Mark Zuckerberg and fellow Facebook founder Chris Hughes, delightedly unaware that it was not the computer on Zuckerberg’s lap they had just opened, but Pandora’s box. For a while, the optimism held, with tech and its birthing of social media celebrated as a remedy for all manner of ills, even the one that had announced the arrival of the century. The men of violence had brought 9/11, but a decade later and Twitter seemed to be harbingers of democracy, enabling those Arab spring uprisings, and others, against hated dictatorships. It would not work out that way, and not only because of the long shadow cast by the war on terror. On another September day, in another steel-and-glass citadel of finance, there came another collapse, one whose impact is still felt. The implosion of was at the centre of a global crash that marked the end of an economic holiday from history that had endured since the 90s. The stagnation that followed, with wages static or falling in real terms, created the backdrop for the political upheavals that marked the next two decades. Yet it was far from the only shock the world had to absorb. The climate crisis was a constant throughout, as it is in this collection, making its presence felt in fire and flood, whether submerging Pakistan or New Orleans. (Bush’s catastrophic mishandling of that disaster is one more reason why he has been lucky in his latest successor: if it weren’t for the current occupant of the White House, W’s place as the most reviled US president of the early 21st century would have been assured.) In 2020, we were struck by a global pandemic that can still seem like a collective bad dream. To look at a photograph such as the one here of an elderly Spanish couple, separated for a hundred days and by sheets of plastic, is to ask: did that really happen? There are other pictures that look now like early warnings of trouble to come. The “separation wall” encircling the is a reminder that, after the failure of peace talks at Camp David in 2000, there has been a further 25 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to add to the decades that went before, culminating in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that exploded on 7 October 2023 and has only recently paused. Similarly, the image from Ukraine in 2014 appears now like a premonition of the Russian invasion of 2022. These have been turbulent years, roiled by culture wars and a long-delayed reckoning over race – how extraordinary now to recall that taking the knee began with a single athlete making a single gesture – and by vast movements of people. The agony of today’s refugee crisis is distilled in the sight of a two-year-old child, , face down on a beach. That cauldron of discontents was stirred further by tech platforms that were no longer about old friends reconnecting, but about strangers dividing against each other, their sources of information filtered along partisan lines, until they could be persuaded to believe almost anything, and usually the worst. All of those currents fed into the movement that has defined the last decade or so, embodied by Boris Johnson and his notorious Brexit bus – a lie on wheels – and, of course, by the man who is the face of these times: . That movement is nationalist populism and it feeds on the many plagues of the 21st century, from stalled or declining living standards to social media, adroitly channelling unease and fear into hostility towards migrants, minorities and each other. Gaze upon the titans of tech come to pay homage to Trump as he returned to the White House in January and you see we are living through what the Italian writer Giuliano da Empoli calls “the hour of the predator”. Yet there are enough images of wonder here to believe the rest of the 21st century might be different: look at the selfie taken by the rover to be reminded of what we are capable of. The next 25 years are no more preordained than the last. Like the cameras that captured these extraordinary moments, they are in our hands. When news came of the first plane crashing into one of the twin towers on 11 September 2001, Susan Meiselas cycled downtown with her camera – “moving toward what everyone else was desperately fleeing from”, with “no sense of the scale of what had happened”. For her, this image stands out as a rare moment of “stillness amid the chaos”. It shows a lifesize statue of a businessman, Double Check (1982) by John Seward Johnson II, surrounded by debris in Liberty Plaza Park, across from the World Trade Center. Initially Meiselas couldn’t tell if it was a real person. Today, she sees the statue as a symbol of the attempt to make sense of the enormity of 9/11 and its terrible aftermath: George W Bush’s “war on terror”. “A lot has happened as a consequence. Even the endless lines of security at the airport – these are small reminders of our distrust of each other.” On 31 March 2003, an Iraqi man and his four-­year-­old child were arrested by American forces and taken to a prisoner of war camp near the southern Iraqi city of Najaf. French photojournalist Jean-Marc Bouju snapped the moment just after they had removed the man’s handcuffs, so he could comfort his distressed son. The image won the World Press Photo of the year award, and captured for many the cruelty of the US’s invasion of Iraq. The hooded figure, attempting to preserve some humanity in an overwhelmingly hostile situation, foreshadows the infamous images of abused prisoners taken by American soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison, which would hit the headlines not long after. The image of Saddam Hussein’s statue being pulled down in Baghdad as American forces entered the city on 9 April 2003 became one of the iconic images of the war. It was promoted by the Pentagon as a symbol of Iraqis joyously greeting the overthrow of their hated dictator. “I’m happy with the picture,” photographer Sean Smith says, “but not with things that may be ascribed to it – as a defining moment, say, because it wasn’t.” Even at the time, Smith felt “uneasy about becoming part of a false narrative”. He had been in Baghdad for months, as war had inched closer, and got to know many Iraqis. He knew the situation was more complex: “This wasn’t the liberation of Paris.” Most of the crowd that day, he remembers, were journalists staying in an overlooking hotel. “It was getting to their deadline time,” he remembers, “and they wanted a headline.” Looking back, Smith is also saddened by the illusion of finality the photograph represents. When he returned to Iraq for work years later, one conversation about the invasion stuck with him. When an American soldier argued that it had been necessary for the freedom of the Iraqis, an Iraqi interpreter replied, “All I know is that everyone knows someone who’s died.” It is a symbol of one of the most enduring conflicts of the century. In 2002, during the second intifada, the Israeli government started to build what is known as the Separation Wall: a barrier between Israel and the West Bank, which it has occupied illegally since 1967. This image shows children dwarfed by an eight-metre-high section of wall at Abu Dis, a Palestinian village in the suburbs of Jerusalem cut off from the rest of the city. The permits Palestinians need to cross the wall are hard to obtain, so movement is severely restricted. The barrier, which has been deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice, was “presented as a security measure”, explains Emma Graham-Harrison, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, after a spate of suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians. “However, it also functioned as both a land grab and a key step in enforcing separation. In some ways, it was a template for what Israel attempted to do with its fence enclosing Gaza: the idea that you could contain Palestinians physically without having to engage with them as fellow human beings or consider their political aspirations.” “I got a call from an editor,” Boston-based photographer Rick Friedman recalls: “‘I need you to go over to Harvard and photograph these two kids with their computers.’” It was 14 May, a few months after Zuckerberg and Hughes had founded a social media site that, in its earliest iteration, invited students to rate the attractiveness of female classmates. Friedman recalls the young pair were “very agreeable”, but also remembers thinking, “Is this some kid trying to get a date with his computer?” It is sometimes said we are living in the Chinese century. Rapid industrialisation has seen China grow into an economic superpower – the “world’s factory” –accounting for up to 30% of global manufacturing output. Edward Burtynsky, whose acclaimed photographs document the effects of human industry around the globe, began working there in 2002. On one visit, struck by the number of chicken farms, he became curious about China’s food industry. This image shows one of the country’s largest poultry-processing facilities, the Jilin Deda factory in Dehui city, where products were being prepared for export to Japan. “I’m always trying to find ways to represent in one frame the larger-than-life scale of what’s happening,” Burtynsky says. The concept of a meme as a self-replicating nugget of information was first popularised by Richard Dawkins in the 1970s in the context of genetics. But it was in this century that memes took off online, and became household names. This image, declared “one of the most famous memes in history”, has humble origins. In 2005, Zoë Roth, AKA “Disaster Girl”, and her amateur photographer father were watching a local fire department training exercise, in which a donated house had been set on fire. Her father told her to smile and snapped the image. Drawn to the “evil” smile, people Photoshopped in other disasters – the Titanic, the Hindenburg. “George Bush does not care about Black people,” a 28-year-old Kanye West announced during a telethon to raise money for disaster relief in the wake of . Making landfall on the Gulf coast on 29 August 2005, it flooded 80% of New Orleans, killing 1,500 people and displacing roughly 1.5 million – but it was the deeper faultlines in American society, brutally revealed by the disaster, that came to define it. As former MP Oona King, who visited the city shortly after the disaster, wrote, “The remarkable thing about Hurricane Katrina was that, like a bolt of lightning, it clearly and unavoidably illuminated the chilling impact of race.” “This photo became the moment that defined an era,” wrote Paris Hilton in November 2024, marking the 18th anniversary of this famous paparazzi shot of her with Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears at the height of their fame, crammed in the front seat of Hilton’s car outside the Beverly Hills hotel. The photo was splashed across the papers; in the New York Post, it ran with the headline “Bimbo Summit”. At the time, it was the quintessential image of 2000s celebrity glamour. All three women have since spoken out about their treatment by the media: the misogynistic scrutiny and judgment that spread far beyond celebrity circles. “They loved pitting women against each other,” Hilton has said. “It was so vicious.” The Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga national park, Africa’s oldest conservation area, is exceptionally biodiverse – and one of the most dangerous places to work. Since 1996, more than 200 rangers have been killed in a series of conflicts. Photographer Brett Stirton took this picture after seven rare mountain gorillas were killed by hostile gunmen wanting to warn rangers not to disrupt illegal charcoal manufacturing in the area. Locals and park workers carried the bodies to a burial site. “Everyone was silent,” Stirton recalled later. “It was very reverent.” Not all is lost. Last year, published in the journal Science found conservation efforts around the world were helping stem the decline of biodiversity. “Our results clearly show there is room for hope,” one co-author said. One of this century’s biggest scientific discoveries took place in the , the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, which opened at Cern in Geneva in 2008. This photo was taken when construction was under way. Still the largest machine ever built, it consists of a 27km ring of superconducting magnets in a tunnel 100 metres underground. The magnets, chilled to a temperature lower than in outer space, are used to propel high-energy particle beams into collisions. By studying the results of these, particle physicists hope to answer questions about the essential workings of the universe. In 2012, they made a major breakthrough: the discovery of the Higgs boson, the so-called “God particle”. unveiled the first iPhone. “We are all born with the ultimate pointing device – our fingers – and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse,” the Apple CEO said. (For his demo, seen here, he had to follow a carefully planned “golden path” to avoid glitches; the software wasn’t yet finished.) The touchscreen smartphone was released six months later, totally transforming the way we communicate. Today more than 1.4bn iPhones are in use globally. This photo of staff at the Lehman Brothers offices in London’s Canary Wharf was taken on 11 September 2008. Over the past year, the global financial system had been showing cracks. Now Lehman was in trouble, with its share price plummeting and rumours of a buyout. “This meeting was called just before lunch,” (back left, minus the grey-suit banker trousers because his work clothes were at the cleaner’s). “A couple of senior bankers made a speech, saying, ‘We’re not going bankrupt, get back to work.’” Four days later, Lehman did go bankrupt. “Trust evaporated and funds stopped flowing around the world,” says economic historian Catherine Schenk. What followed was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. “It reminded us that, as in 1930, failures in the richest countries could spark a financial crisis that had repercussions in markets everywhere.” Shown here in the last stages of its construction – and already towering over everything that surrounds it – the in Dubai has held the record for the world’s tallest building since opening its doors in January 2010. The neofuturist mega-scraper, with its 163 floors reaching 828 metres high, is not just a dizzying feat of engineering: it’s a symbol of the equally dizzying, oil-fuelled rise of the Gulf states in the 21st century. In this era of expansion, flashy development projects have become a major tool of soft power: what the critic Rowan Moore has called a “cultural and architectural arms race”. The race is still on: the Burj Khalifa is soon to be eclipsed by the Jeddah Tower in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled for completion – with a height of 1,000 metres – by 2028. “It was one of those moments that gets stuck in your head,” Damon Winter recalls. “Part of it was the irony that a memorable photo could come from such a banal setting – a podium in front of an American flag.” Yet everything lined up, from the shaft of light to Obama’s smile, and today the image captures something of the optimism and dynamism of his 2008 campaign – qualities absent from many other campaigns of the century. “It was a very optimistic time,” Winter says. “The country was experiencing this momentous change.” Unlike other politicians Winter had covered, Obama “seemed like the same person on stage as he was when interacting with people. It seemed to me that he was really interested in people.” In spring 2010, after 187 years of silence, the Eyjafjallajökull volcano on the south coast of Iceland began a powerful eruption. It spewed fine volcanic ash high into the atmosphere, which began blowing towards the UK and western Europe. Almost all flights in the region were grounded due to fears that the ash would clog and stall jet engines. Stranded in Iceland, photographer Lucas Jackson was able to capture this spectacular image of the northern lights playing over the erupting volcano. “When you’re a photographer,” he told the Guardian in 2010, “it’s really rare to actually be exactly where you want to be to take the shot. We were laughing about how crazy it all was.” In the summer of 2010, record-breaking rains led to extreme flooding in Pakistan. At the peak, one-fifth of the country was submerged. Nearly 2,000 people died and more than 20 million were affected, with homes and crops lost. Though unprecedented at the time, such severe flooding has since become a recurring event, including this summer. As temperatures rise across the world, floods are becoming more frequent and intense. Unsurprisingly, poorer nations and communities are most affected. But, as UN secretary general António Guterres warned earlier this year, “No country is safe.” On 11 March 2011, a massive 9.0 undersea earthquake off the north-­east coast of Japan triggered a tsunami that killed an estimated 20,000 people. More than a million buildings were damaged, including the Daiichi nuclear plant, where three reactors went into meltdown after flooding of the power supply disabled the cooling systems. It was the worst nuclear accident in history after Chornobyl. Several workers were injured in explosions at the facility and more than 100,000 people in the wider region were evacuated to avoid radiation exposure. It’s estimated that 2,313 “indirect deaths” resulted from physical and mental stress, and that 29,000 people remain displaced. The central Cairo roundabout known as Tahrir Square became the symbolic centre of the Arab spring in early 2011, though the movement itself had began the year before in Tunisia, after market seller Mohamed Bouazizi, a target of government harassment and corruption, set himself on fire outside a governor’s office. “The Arab world was ripe with hope,” wrote Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Yet “these expectations were quickly shattered”. The assassination of Khashoggi that year, on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reflected the wider slide into violence: Syria, Libya and Yemen have since suffered years of brutal civil war, and Egypt remains under the iron-fisted rule of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power after the protests. From late 2013 to 2016, the worst virus outbreak in history killed more than 11,000 people in the west African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The fatality rate for recorded cases was 40%, attributed to poor standards of care, mistrust of medical authorities and an international response prioritising containment over treatment. Daniel Berehulak photographed James Dorbor, eight, being carried into a clinic in the Liberian capital of Monrovia in September 2014; during a three-hour wait to be admitted. His father was not allowed to embrace him when medical staff finally took him in, carrying him, Berehulak said, “like he was a bag of garbage”. In 2014, Melilla – a tiny slice of Spanish territory in Morocco – became emblematic of the rise of “Fortress Europe” policies in the 21st century. Human rights activist José Palazón captured the moment a group of men attempting to cross Melilla’s border became stuck on a razor wire fence for hours while Spanish golfers continued their game below. Eight years later, Melilla would become the site of in which at least 37 people trying to cross into Spain were killed by border guards. Palazón shared his photo on Twitter, with the caption: “Immigrants on the fence, expulsions and a game of golf. Only in Melilla.” The surreal image of inequality quickly went viral. “It seemed like a good moment to take a photo that was a bit more symbolic,” he later said. can be traced back to “Euromaidan” – the anti-government protests, centred in Kyiv, that began in November 2013 after then president Viktor Yanukovych gave in to Russian pressure and withdrew from an agreement that would have brought the country closer to the EU. On the uprising’s bloodiest day, 20 February 2014, Jérôme Sessini, who had arrived just a day before, documented what he saw – “not even thinking about the danger” – including this Orthodox priest blessing protesters at a barricade. More than 50 of them were shot dead that day. The origins of the term “selfie” are humble: an Australian man posting a substandard picture of his bruised lip to an online forum in 2002. “Sorry about the focus,” he wrote. “It was a selfie.” The next year, sales of phones with front-facing cameras began to increase and by 2013 “selfie” was Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year. Organised by Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars, this selfie broke the internet. Eleven years on, it might be cursed: Kevin Spacey would face damning sexual abuse allegations, Brangelina broke up. The number of people risking crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, fleeing wars and persecution in the Middle East and Africa, rose dramatically in the mid-2010s. In 2013, the Italian government launched its search-and-rescue operation Mare Nostrum, after hundreds died in two shipwrecks off Lampedusa. Shot from a helicopter, Massimo Sestini’s image shows 500 people on a boat 25km from Libya’s coast, before they were rescued by Italy’s navy as part of an operation controversially halted that year. At least 20,000 have died or disappeared in the Med since. On 2 September 2015, photojournalist Nilüfer Demir saw the body of a toddler, Alan Kurdi, on a beach near Bodrum, Turkey. “There was nothing left to do for him,” she said later, “except take his photograph. And that’s exactly what I did.” Alan was born in Syria in 2012. His family had been trying to reach Greece, but soon after their boat launched, it overturned and Alan and his mother drowned. “I was holding my wife’s hand,” his grief-stricken father later told the media, “but my children slipped through my hands. It was dark and everyone was screaming.” Demir’s shocking image quickly spread. But, despite protests, a spike in donations to charities and western governments promising to do more, the Med remains the world’s deadliest border. It was a high point in the movement for trans visibility. In June 2015, made her public debut in a portrait by Annie Leibovitz on the cover of Vanity Fair. It instantly had positive support and Jenner became the fastest person to hit 1 million Twitter followers, before facing a backlash when she came out as a Trump voter. Since then, trans rights have been rolled back in the US and UK, but support remains strong. Earlier this year, the world’s largest trans pride march took place in London, with a 100,000-strong crowd. “There you go, I’m the greatest,” said Usain Bolt when he achieved an unprecedented three consecutive Olympic golds (in 2008, 2012, 2016) in three races. Here, in the Rio 100m semi-final, “Lightning Bolt” seems to have found time to flash the camera a smile. He was in fact checking whether the runner to his left was catching up: “I saw I had him covered, Brexit is, for many, the ground zero of what Marina Hyde called “an age of gathering chaos and rising disbelief” in the UK. The “Brexit bus”, reportedly masterminded by Dominic Cummings but closely associated with Boris Johnson, became the subject of bitter arguments and a symbol of the chaos that has engulfed the UK since. Its slogan, claiming the UK sent £350m a week to the EU, was disputed, with the UK Statistics Authority deeming it “a clear misuse of official statistics”. has shown Brexit has in fact put unprecedented strain on the NHS. On 1 September 2016, during a San Francisco 49ers pre-season game, the quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled while America’s national anthem was played, in protest at police violence against Black people. His gesture was adopted by – this photo shows him with Eli Harold and Eric Reid – then spread across the world, becoming linked to the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in spring 2020. The gesture was highly controversial: Kaepernick was ousted from the league a year later and has never again played for an NFL team. “We die in Aleppo, you die here,” shouted Turkish off-duty riot squad officer Mevlüt Mert Altıntaş after killing the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, at a gallery in Ankara, in protest at the actions of the Russian military in Syria. Soon after photographer Burhan Ozbilic snapped this unsettling image. Altıntaş was shot and killed by police. the day after Donald Trump’s first inauguration as president, millions of women gathered across the world – including 500,000 in Washington – mobilised by his misogyny and sexual assault allegations. It was one of the largest single-day protests in US history, and nine months later its energy fed into the , which began as a disquieting story of one Hollywood producer’s abuse of women and soon turned into a global reckoning. In 2017, the eminent German photographer Andreas Gursky, known for his vast, detailed, era-defining landscapes, trained his camera on an warehouse in Arizona packed full of goods destined for customers. This century has seen internet shopping go from a niche experiment – in 2000, the Guardian reported that anxieties about postage time had led to a “collapse” of online pre-Christmas book sales – to one of the most common ways to make a purchase. “It was super weird,” recalls Giulio Di Sturco of his visit to a Hong Kong lab to photograph Sophia the Robot. “Pieces of robots everywhere, five guys working like mechanics – to think the future might be built in this kind of space.” The idea that Sophia represented a major leap in AI was big news: the next year, she became a citizen of Saudi Arabia – the first robot to be granted legal personhood anywhere. There were sceptics, however, and ChatGPT’s arrival in 2022 might suggest the future of AI is in chatbots and datacentres instead. But Di Sturco believes the humanoid robot’s time is still to come. “They were on the edge of something interesting,” he says. After decades in which their game was dwarfed by men’s, women are winning fans for their playing and inclusivity. Megan Rapinoe’s victory pose after scoring for the US in the 2019 World Cup went viral: a symbol of both her athleticism and her advocacy on issues including LGBTQ+ rights and mental health. “This is the best night of my entire life,” a 25-year-old told the crowd during his historic set at Glastonbury in 2019, as the first Black British solo act to headline the festival. Wearing a Banksy-designed union jack stab vest, Stormzy crafted a set that both celebrated Black British culture – with guest performances from Ballet Black, WAR collective and Dave – and critiqued racism in the UK. Praised by everyone from David Lammy, Zadie Smith and Jeremy Corbyn to Adele and Ghetts, the performance went out of its way to educate its audience and reference the many acts that had come before to make it possible. “This was about arrival,” Smith wrote in the New Yorker, “of a king and his court and the many, many people who have hoped for this day.” This photo shows the emotional reunion of Agustina Cañamero and Pascual Pérez, a couple in their 80s, in a nursing home in Barcelona in June 2020. Husband and wife had been separated for 102 days in the first lockdown – their longest time apart in 59 years of marriage. The image has come to symbolise how lives worldwide were upended by Covid. The global health emergency was declared over in May 2023, and may feel like a distant memory. Yet more than seven million people have died to date, and many others are dealing with grief or long-term health issues. “Most of my generation have been affected in deep, developmental ways and that’s going to affect us for ever,” 21-year-old student Eoin O’Loughlin told the Guardian, in a 2023 series on the “ On 6 January 2021, in the wake of Joe Biden’s election win, a crowd began to peel off from Trump’s fiery speech in which he accused the Democrats of stealing the election from him. Photographer Victor J Blue followed them as they broke into the Capitol buildings, and took this picture after they had been expelled – police officers, running out of pepper spray, were letting off fire extinguishers in an attempt to discourage protesters from breaking back in, which accounts for the “smoke” at the centre of the photo. Was there once life on Mars? And could the planet, as , offer us a home when Earth becomes uninhabitable? It’s no surprise its exploration has been the dominant story of the 21st-century space race so far. Nasa’s Perseverance rover landed , searching for signs of past life, so we can better understand the planet’s habitability.

taken in 2024, is “such a nice encapsulation of what Nasa’s mission is all about”, says project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. Stitched together from 62 images (which is why the rover’s arm is missing), it shows Perseverance alongside the helicopter Ingenuity – the first aircraft to complete a powered, controlled flight on another planet. As for colonising the Red Planet, Stack Morgan points out we might first “ask whether we have been good stewards of our own planet”. “At that moment,” said 81-year-old Panayiota Kritsiopi, “I was shouting not only for myself, but for the whole village.” She was photographed as a huge wildfire on the Greek island of Evia forced thousands to flee and eventually burned more than half the island. Miraculously, Kritsiopi’s home would be spared; the fire reportedly stopped a metre from her house. That year was quickly surpassed by 2022, then 2024, as Europe’s hottest on record, while this summer saw the worst wildfire season in European history. activist Anna Holland (right) of the day they and Phoebe Plummer approached a Van Gogh painting in the National Gallery, London, can in hand. “Almost before I knew it, we were throwing the soup.” The stunt was part of a wave of climate action that has flourished this century, focused on symbolic targets such as this (safely protected behind glass). Though the pair were sentenced to prison under Britain’s increasingly draconian protest laws, they inspired fellow soup throwers worldwide. The queen’s death on 8 September 2022, at 96, ended a 70-year reign – the longest of any UK monarch. Some 250,000 people joined the (very British) queue to see her lying in state ahead of the funeral, itself watched by 29 million TV viewers in the UK. Here, her son, Charles III – at 73, the oldest person to succeed the throne – walks beside her coffin in Westminster Abbey. His grief is palpable, but beyond loss there is uncertainty: what next? In March 2018, tragedy struck: Sudan, the last northern white male rhino, died. With only two females left, the species was functionally extinct. Then, a flash of hope: a foetus created using sperm taken from males before they died. Sadly, the mother died of an unrelated infection. But tests showed the tiny foetus would probably have survived. Said photographer Jon A Juárez, “Though the story is bittersweet, the foetus proves the science works. If we support scientists’ efforts, we can still correct our course and make the planet a better place.” There was a period when Taylor Swift’s Eras tour – 149 shows in 51 cities over 21 months – seemed like it would never end. Neither did the appetite of her global fanbase, who packed out stadium after stadium for 3.5-hour performances of Swift’s greatest hits. When the international juggernaut finally concluded in December 2024, it was the highest-grossing concert tour of all time: more than $2bn in ticket sales. Her supremacy was confirmed. The success of the tour also reflected the post-pandemic boom in major live music events, driven by fans craving joy and connection, as well as by artists seeking to supplement their incomes in the era of streaming. Meanwhile, it’s often said that our century has seen the death of the monoculture. Swift, it seems, is one of the last stars standing. “Let me get my shoes,” were Trump’s first words to the Secret Service agents bundling him away, after a sniper’s bullet grazed his ear. It was what he said next, however, fist raised, that sealed the moment in history: “Fight!” The image galvanised his supporters and injected new energy into his campaign. Coming just weeks after Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, this pivotal moment convinced commentators on both sides of the political spectrum that a second presidency was within his grasp. It is a defining image of power in 2025: , Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk in the front row at Trump’s inauguration (Apple CEO Tim Cook is out of frame). The tech bosses – of Meta, Amazon, Google and Tesla – are collectively worth almost $1tn, a figure that reflects the sharp increase in inequality globally this century. The image also captures the political journey the US tech sector has been on," from darling of the left to throwing in its lot with the Maga right.""",Jonathan Freedland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/weather-tracker-deep-freeze-canada-us-records-warmest-christmas,Weather tracker: Deep freeze grips Canada as US records warmest Christmas,2025-12-26T11:52:23.000Z,"Temperatures plunge below -50C in the Yukon, while swaths of US experience springlike weather has been gripped by an intense and prolonged cold spell, with temperatures hovering between -20C and -40C for weeks. On Tuesday, Braeburn in the Yukon recorded -55.7C, its coldest December temperature since 1975. Meanwhile, Mayo and Dawson endured 16 consecutive nights below -40C, with Mayo plunging to -50.4C on Monday. Whitehorse also recorded 10 nights when temperatures dropped below -30C. The deep freeze spread farther south over the festive period. On Christmas Day, overnight temperatures in Edmonton fell below -28C, while Boxing Day was expected to bring lows of at least -20C across many regions, including Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa and Quebec. The severe cold is forecast to persist into the new year. Officials have warned that the Yukon could face electricity outages in the coming days, as the territory’s power grid comes under strain from record-high energy demand. The prolonged chill has been caused by the polar vortex remaining anchored over Canada for much of December, allowing bitter Arctic air to spill south. Next week, the cold air mass is expected to retreat north gradually, enabling milder Pacific air to move across the US and into parts of southern Canada. In stark contrast, parts of the US experienced their warmest Christmas Day on record as temperatures soared about 15-30C above the seasonal average. In many areas, conditions felt more typical of April or May than late December. Several states set Christmas Day temperature records. In Oklahoma, Oklahoma City hit 25C on Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak of 22C set in 1982. Cities including Austin and Dallas, in Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, were also among those that recorded temperatures above 25C. Above-average warmth is expected to continue through Boxing Day and the days ahead, with unseasonable heat forecast to sweep into the south-eastern states later in the week. The warmth has been fuelled by a strong upper-level ridge extending from the desert south-west towards the north and east, creating a heat-dome effect. This pattern establishes a broad area of high pressure across much of the continent, trapping warm air near the surface. As air sinks through the atmosphere, it compresses and heats further, allowing unusually warm temperatures to build.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 2,000 members of the public were polled by the consumer group Which? in January about the gifts they received last Christmas, with 21% of those surveyed saying they had been given an unwanted or unsuitable present. Deodorant with the fragrance of Marmite – a and Lynx body spray – as well as rotten coconut and pineapple were among the biggest disappointments reported, as well as a Tottenham Hotspur book which was not enthusiastically welcomed by its recipient, a Chelsea fan. The consumer group asked people about other duds they had got: one vertigo sufferer with a fear of flying was given a helicopter ride by their daughter. When asked what they did with an unwanted gift, a third (33%) of those surveyed said they kept it and would use it, while a sixth (15%) said they would keep it but not use it. Once the dust has settled on the festive celebrations, a third (34%) of those surveyed admitted to getting rid of the unwanted present rather than returning or exchanging it. Among popular options for passing on an unsuitable item were giving it to a friend or family member, which 12% of respondents did, while 10% said they had given it to a charity shop and 8% had sold it on an online marketplace. Only 2% of those surveyed said they had thrown away an unwanted present, with just 1% admitting to giving it back to the person who bought it for them. “Our research shows that a fifth of us have been left wondering what to do with an unwanted gift,” said Lisa Webb, a consumer law expert at Which?. “It’s always worth getting a gift receipt so your loved one has the option to return their gift if needed.” Thankfully, many retailers extend their returns policy over the festive period, allowing many people who received a disappointing gift to get a refund or exchange it for another item or a voucher. “Sometimes, for online orders, only the buyer can request a refund or exchange,” Webb added. “But if the item was marked as a gift when ordered, the retailer’s returns policy may enable a recipient to return or exchange it.” Which? advises consumers they will usually need to provide proof of purchase in order to return an unwanted item. Some retailers do not allow refunds to credit or debit cards unless the original card holder is present. Depending on the returns policy, they may, however, offer a gift card, voucher or credit note.",Joanna Partridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/22/families-of-palestine-action-hunger-strikers-seek-urgent-meeting-with-lammy,Families of Palestine Action hunger strikers seek urgent meeting with Lammy,2025-12-22T19:07:17.000Z,"Justice secretary urged to ‘show a bit of humanity’ with protesters severely ill after refusing food for weeks Families and supporters of Palestine Action-affiliated hunger strikers have pleaded with David Lammy to meet them in an attempt to end the impasse over the protest that has left some of them severely unwell. On Monday, as the protest reached a dangerous stage, lawyers for the hunger strikers sent a legal letter claiming that by refusing a meeting the justice secretary had failed to comply with the Ministry of Justice’s own policy on handling of hunger strikes. The intervention came after three of the prisoners were simultaneously in hospital on Sunday: Qesser Zuhrah, 20, and Amu Gib, 30, who have been refusing food for 51 days and Kamran Ahmed, 28, who is on day 43 of his hunger strike. For Ahmed, it was the third time he has been hospitalised, with his condition now beyond the point of urgency, his sister Shahmina Alam said. Asked if she had a message for Lammy, Alam said: “There’s still time to do better, better for the citizens of the UK in ending the UK complicity in the ongoing genocide [by Israel in Gaza], by supporting the prisoners that are putting their lives on the line to ensure transparency and integrity in our justice and government systems. “He has a choice. He can say something and he can do something about this and meet with the solicitors or family members of the hunger strikers and he can show a bit of humanity.” Referring to the Irish republican hunger strike during the Troubles that culminated in the death of Bobby Sands and nine others, she added: “We should not repeat the hunger strike of 1981, and we should not have to look at things in retrospect and wonder how things went so wrong when we have an opportunity to fix it now.” Alam, 33, a pharmacist, said that the family were told on Monday that Ahmed was discharged late on Sunday night “but we haven’t received any phone call from him, so we don’t know how he’s doing or why he went in the first place”. A repeated complaint of relatives and friends has been that they have not received updates when the prisoners are hospitalised. Zuhrah is believed to still be in hospital after . Protesters gathered overnight on Tuesday accusing prison staff of refusing to allow her transfer to emergency care. Her designated next of kin, her friend Ella Moulsdale, 21, said last week: “Imagine … someone you love and not knowing if they’re alive … I have no confirmation that she was inside that ambulance, that she is being treated in the hospital.” , said: “Unlike the British government, the hunger strikers cannot take a Christmas holiday, as they continue to be locked up in prison cells, suffering immensely away from their families. Their lives are in grave danger and they may die at any moment. We have been forced to threaten the government with legal action to get justice for the prisoners, and will not stop until we achieve that.” The legal letter, sent by Imran Khan and Partners, said the claimants had a “legitimate expectation” from official policy documents “that the proposed defendant would convene a review meeting of individuals ‘most likely to bring about the resolution of the situation’, including ‘those suggested by the individual’ refusing food, to ‘address the reasons for their refusal’”. It called for a reply by 2pm on Tuesday “given the urgency of the situation in respect of our clients’ deteriorating health”. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said on Monday: “We strongly refute these claims. We want these prisoners to accept support and get better, and we will not create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes.” All the hunger strikers are in prison awaiting trial charged with offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage during protest actions. They will have served more than a year in jail before standing trial. The other current hunger strikers are Heba Muraisi, 31, who is on day 50, , who is on day 44, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day, because he has diabetes, and is on day 16. Alam said: “I can’t really get the words together to [describe] how I feel because how do you put into words what it means when your baby brother is on a knife’s edge?” There is understood to be concern in government about the condition of the prisoners, but also extreme caution about setting a precedent even to facilitate a meeting with Lammy, given the number of prisoners who are forced to spend lengthy periods on remand because of the court backlog. Officials have been told to give regular updates, including on how the prisoners can be persuaded to change their minds and be given support to do so. But sources at the Ministry of Justice said there were very limited powers for the department to do more in terms of legal recourse or medical help that was not already being offered. Deaths in custody from hunger strikes were very rare, officials said, and most ended their strikes voluntarily.",Haroon Siddique,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Police said emergency services were called to a vehicle displaying a mobile billboard that had been set alight in the driveway of a property in St Kilda East about 2.50am on Thursday. On Friday they named 47-year-old John Argento as “a person who may be able to assist with their investigation”. Victoria police said Argento was known to police and had an outstanding arrest warrant relating to other matters. “Detectives believe Argento lives a transient lifestyle. He is known to frequent Melbourne’s inner southern and northern suburbs,” the statement said. “Detectives are treating this arson as a targeted attack but there is no indication that Argento poses as a specific risk to the Jewish community.” No one was inside the car at the time of the incident but the occupants of the house were evacuated as a precaution, police said. The Victoria police assistant commissioner for the southern metro region, Chris Gilbert, said at this stage he did not believe there was a broader threat to the Jewish community. “We understand the devastating impact this type of [alleged] offence has on our Jewish community and we are continuing to prioritise this investigation,” he said. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said on Thursday she had been briefed by police on the St Kilda incident. “This is not what any family, street or community deserves to wake up to on Christmas Day in Australia,” she said on X. “We have a duty to this community: to ensure their families are safe and feel safe right now, and to work long-term in a serious effort to drive anti-Semitism and hate out of our state.” The incident comes less than two weeks after 15 people were killed in a mass shooting that targeted Jews celebrating the holiday of Hanukah at Sydney’s Bondi beach. The state Liberal MP David Southwick, who represents the Caulfield electorate in which the suspected arson occurred, said he had been in touch with the affected family since the incident. “It’s a harrowing experience for anyone to have to go through this,” he said. Southwick reiterated his calls for Victoria to follow New South Wales in recalling parliament to pass The Minns Labor government in NSW recalled parliament this week to pass the laws, whereas the Victorian parliament is not scheduled to return until 2026. “Every day delayed puts the Jewish community and broader Victorian community at risk,” Southwick said. “What are we waiting until February for?”",Catie McLeod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X on Friday, adding that “a lot can be decided before the New Year”. Early on Saturday, several powerful explosions rocked Kyiv as authorities warned that the Ukrainian capital was under threat of missile attack and that air defences were in operation. Ukraine’s air force also announced a countrywide air alert, saying on social media that drones and missiles were moving over several Ukrainian regions, including the capital. Zelenskyy told journalists the high-stakes meeting with Trump would focus on some of the most sensitive parts of the peace talks, including and reconstruction, plus territorial discussions regarding the Donbas region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “This meeting is specifically intended to refine things as much as we possibly can,” Zelenskyy said. He added that the proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”. “Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. He later added: “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.” The plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin’s demands. Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato’s Article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms. “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree” to the peace proposals, Zelenskyy told reporters. on Friday, Trump said he anticipated a “good” meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy’s plan. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told the news website. “So we’ll see what he’s got.” last weekend in Miami, where Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met separately with Russian and Ukrainian representatives, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. US officials described the discussions as “constructive”, though Moscow has played down expectations of progress and there are few signs that Vladimir Putin is prepared to soften his maximalist demands to end the full-scale invasion. Trump in the interview with Politico said he expected to speak with Putin “soon, as much as I want”. At a closed-door meeting with Russia’s business elite on Wednesday evening, the Russian president reportedly reiterated his demand that Ukraine hand over the entire eastern Donbas region as part of any peace deal. According to Kommersant, one of Russia’s best-connected newspapers, Putin also indicated openness to a limited territorial exchange with Ukraine, with Moscow potentially exchanging small areas of land Russian forces occupy in Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv and southern Zaporizhzhia regions. Zelenskyy has previously said Ukraine would be open to withdrawing “heavy forces” from parts of Donbas it still controls, but only if Russia mirrored the move as part of a US-backed initiative to create a “free economic zone” in the region. It remains highly uncertain that Moscow would accept either a suggested demilitarised buffer zone or a withdrawal of its forces, even as other sticking points remain, including control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that Kyiv says should be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine. On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, had held a call with the US administration after Moscow received an updated US proposal on a potential peace deal, although there were no signs that a breakthrough had been reached. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, used a Russian television appearance on Friday to criticise Zelenskyy and European allies. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said. “Especially in a context where Kyiv and its sponsors – notably within the European Union, who are not in favour of an agreement – have stepped up efforts to torpedo it.” He said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord,” Ryabkov added. Russia has repeatedly said it was prepared to continue fighting in Ukraine if no peace deal were reached, saying it was confident it could achieve its war aims through military means. Yet while Moscow has made slow, grinding on the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have in recent days pushed Russian troops out of the It marked a rare successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, prompting frustration among pro-war Russian bloggers over what many described as overly upbeat and unrealistic battlefield briefings. “On the Kupyansk front, large-scale territorial losses have come to light, caused by the systematic submission of false reports that exaggerated the Russian armed forces’ successes in the battle for Kupyansk and surrounding settlements,” the popular Telegram channel Rybar, which has close links to the defence ministry, wrote. In late November, senior Russian generals briefed Putin that Russian troops had “completed the liberation of Kupyansk”, prompting Zelenskyy to travel to the city’s outskirts to “show the world that Putin is lying”.",Pjotr Sauer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For more than a decade, Russia’s so-called market – a term derived from the verb “to pierce” or “to punch into a search bar” – has operated as a parallel information economy built on a network of corrupt officials, traffic police, bank employees and low-level security staff willing to sell access to restricted government or corporate databases. While leaked databases exist everywhere, the scale and routine use of is uniquely Russian. It grew out of the country’s deeply corrupt state infrastructure and became indispensable both to those seeking to exploit the system and to those trying to expose it. For a modest fee – sometimes as little as $10 – buyers can obtain passport numbers, home addresses, travel histories, car registrations and internal police records. At the higher end, entire dossiers could be purchased on individuals, including metadata on calls and movements. , whose use remains controversial among Russian journalists, have underpinned high-profile , including tracing the FSB state security unit behind the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. It also served the police and security services themselves, who routinely used the black market to track activists, opposition figures and anyone who fell outside the state’s favour. “It is one of the paradoxes of modern Russia: on the one hand, these services are illegal and rely on leaked data, yet on the other, they are far more convenient for day-to-day police work than the multitude of official departmental databases,” said Andrei Zakharov, an investigative journalist who recently stretched into its fourth year, the Kremlin began to view less as a tolerated convenience and more as a threat. were using leaked data on an industrial scale, while Ukrainian intelligence had learned to exploit the country’s porous information landscape to identify and assassinate military officials inside Russia. During his annual phone-in with the nation last year, President himself admitted that a close friend had fallen victim to a phone scam. That incident, said Zakharov, was the signal for security services to start closing down on the market. Over the past year, Putin has signed laws tightening penalties for data leaks, imposing up to 10 years in prison for accessing or distributing such information. The security services have also begun an aggressive hunt for operators, detaining several brokers and targeting the infrastructure they rely on. Among the most high-profile arrests was of the team behind Usersbox, one of the widest-used and cheapest services. appears to have had the opposite effect, Zakharov said. Many of the leading operators and brokers have moved their businesses abroad where they are far less constrained by informal deals with the security services or fear of immediate arrest. “Before, they still worked with the security services, or would think twice before releasing something extremely sensitive. Now all their brakes are off,” Zakharov said. “They’re dumping one sensitive leak after another.” He cited last year’s massive FSB database known as Kordon-2023, which was leaked online, containing details of people who had crossed Russia’s borders between 2014 and 2023. Zakharov described it as one of the largest and most consequential leaks to date. Well-known services such as Himera, which had been known to cooperate with the authorities, have changed course: the group said it had cut off law-enforcement access and relocated all its staff. Ukrainian hackers have joined in. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion, pro-Ukrainian hackers and other intelligence groups have repeatedly breached Russian state and commercial systems, stealing data and releasing it openly – often for free, and largely for ideological reasons. Last year, the Ukrainian hacker group KibOrg published online a database belonging to clients of Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest private commercial bank. The leak allegedly contained personal data on roughly 24 million individuals and more than 13m organisations. “Taken together,” Zakharov said, “it has never been easier to find private Russian data on the market.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/21/top-economists-sri-lanka-debt-repayments-restructuring-cyclone-ditwah,Top economists call for halt to Sri Lanka debt repayments after Cyclone Ditwah,2025-12-21T12:10:53.000Z,"Group of 120 experts including Joseph Stiglitz urge fresh debt restructuring plan given scale of destruction A group of the world’s top economists – including the Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz – have called for Sri Lanka’s debt payments to be suspended as it tackles the devastation caused by More than 600 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed across the island, in what Sri Lanka’s president, , called the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”. The country’s $9bn (£6.8bn) national debt was restructured last year, after lengthy negotiations with creditors after the government defaulted on repayments in 2022. But development campaigners warned at the time that the burden on Sri Lankan taxpayers remained unsustainable. Before the cyclone hit, annual repayments were expected to total 25% of government revenues – a high level by international and historical standards. In a statement, the group of 120 global experts called for fresh debt restructuring to restore the country’s repayments to a manageable level, given the scale of environmental destruction. Alongside Stiglitz, the signatories include Jayati Ghosh, a renowned Indian development economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US, the inequality expert Thomas Piketty, the former Argentinian economy minister Martín Guzmán, and Kate Raworth, the author of Doughnut , a widely read book about capitalism and the environment. “Sri Lanka is now confronting a severe economic shock triggered by the recent cyclone, extensive flooding and landslides, which has inflicted extensive damage to infrastructure, livelihoods, and key sectors of the economy,” they said. “This environmental emergency is poised to absorb – and potentially exceed – the extremely limited fiscal space created by the current debt restructuring package. Additional external debt is already being taken on from the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)], and more lending to deal with the impacts of the disaster is likely.” They called for the “immediate suspension of Sri Lanka’s external sovereign debt payments, and a new restructuring that restores debt sustainability under the new circumstances”. Research by the campaign group Debt Justice found that after the 2024 debt restructuring deal, which involved some investors accepting a “haircut” on expected repayments, private sector creditors were still on course to make 40% more profit lending to Sri Lanka than to the US government. Since the cyclone hit last month, the Sri Lankan government has to help it through the immediate crisis, but disbursements under this “rapid financing instrument” are usually expected to be repaid within three to five years. Scientists at World Weather Attribution, a coalition of climate experts, found that of Sri Lanka’s flooding, as well as that of other Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, that have also been badly affected in recent weeks. A UK government spokesperson said it recognised the devastating impacts of Cyclone Ditwah on the people of Sri Lanka. “This is why we are committed to supporting Sri Lanka’s recovery through humanitarian assistance and international coordination. We have already provided £1m of humanitarian support via the Red Cross, UN partners and civil society organisations to deliver emergency supplies and life-saving care.”",Heather Stewart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his announcement, Trump said the strikes were aimed at Islamic State militants who have been “targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!” A Department of Defense official told the Associated Press that the US worked with Nigeria to carry out the strikes, and that they had been approved by that country’s government. The US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, said in a Nigeria’s ministry of foreign affairs said the cooperation included exchanges of intelligence and strategic coordination, while the country’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said the strike on the Muslim-majority state of Sokoto was “part of joint ongoing operations”. Parts of the US right have for years been amplifying claims that Christians are facing persecution in Nigeria. In September, the Republican senator Ted Cruz pushed for sanctions against Nigerian officials who “facilitate violence against Christians and other religious minorities, including by Islamist terrorist groups”. Claims that Christians face religious persecution overseas have become a major motivating force for Trump’s base – and the US president counts evangelical Christians as among his most enthusiastic supporters. Earlier this year he appeared to act on some of these concerns by designating Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” under the US International Religious Freedom Act, which followed weeks of lobbying by American lawmakers and conservative Christian groups. Soon after, he ordered the Pentagon to in the country. At the time, the president said he might go in “guns-a-blazing” if the Nigerian government continued to “allow the killing of Christians”. In the past, Nigeria’s government has responded to Trump’s criticisms by saying that people of many faiths, not just Christians, suffer at the hands of extremists groups who operate throughout the country. Nigeria is officially secular but is divided almost evenly between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%), with the remaining population practising African traditional religions. Violence against Christians has and is often framed as religious persecution, but most analysts argue the situation is more complex and attacks can have varying motivations. For example, deadly clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water but exacerbated by religious and ethnic differences. Meanwhile, the kidnappings of priests is seen by many analysts as a trend driven more by money than religious hatred, as priests are viewed as influential figures whose worshippers or organisations can mobilise funds quickly. After Thursday’s strikes, Nigeria’s foreign ministry praised the cooperation with the US but pointedly refused to acknowledge that America’s actions had anything to do with the persecution of Christians. “Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria’s values and to international peace and security,” the ministry said in a statement. Successive Nigerian governments have struggled to get a hold on the nation’s deteriorating security crisis, with thousands of people killed and hundreds more abducted in the past few years. In the north-east, Boko Haram and its splinter groups such as Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap) have waged an insurgency since 2009, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions. On Christmas Eve, a suicide bombing at a mosque in Borno state, where the insurgency began, killed at least five people and left more than 30 others seriously injured. In the north-west, heavily armed criminal gangs – often labelled “bandits” – carry out that affect both Muslim and Christian communities. Last month Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu, said the characterisation of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country did not reflect reality. He said: “Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so … Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/india-electoral-roll-special-intensive-revision-threatens-democracy-muslims,"India’s electoral roll revision threatens democracy and Muslims, say critics",2025-12-16T01:00:07.000Z,"Opposition claims SIR process being used to disenfranchise minority groups to benefit Narendra Modi’s government India’s political opposition has warned that democracy is under threat amid a controversial exercise to revise the voter register across the country, which critics say will disenfranchise minority voters and entrench the power of the ruling An debate erupted in India’s parliament last week over the special intensive revision (SIR) process, which is taking place in nine states and three union territories, in one of the biggest revisions of the country’s electoral roll in decades. Ostensibly a bureaucratic exercise to update the lists of citizens eligible to vote, India’s opposition leaders have instead alleged the SIR is being used by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) as an underhand “citizenship survey”. State leaders have claimed it is being used to disenfranchise poor and minority voters – particularly Muslims – as “illegal immigrants” and manipulate the electoral roll to benefit the Modi government. The BJP openly embraces a Hindu nationalist ideology seeking to reshape India from a secular state into a or Hindu nation. During the party’s 11 years in power, its policies and discourse have sharply polarised the nation along religious lines fuelling a surge in anti-Muslim hostility. The BJP has gained unprecedented power over state institutions and its ruling alliance governs 21 out of 28 states. In states such as West Bengal, critics have alleged that it is primarily Muslims facing the threat of being disenfranchised and deported by SIR, while Bangladeshi Hindus living illegally in India say they are being assured of citizenship. Speaking in parliament last week, Rahul Gandhi, a leader of Congress, India’s largest opposition party, alleged that SIR was part of a wider project by the BJP to conduct “vote [theft]” and destroy the longstanding integrity of India’s democratic elections, which have been held since independence. “When you destroy the vote, you destroy the fabric of this country, you destroy modern India, you destroy the idea of India,” said Gandhi, who in recent months has claimed to have substantial evidence of foul play among the voting processes in multiple state elections, which has been repeatedly denied by the BJP. The opposition has alleged SIR is being used as a covert national register of citizens (NRC), similar to what took place in the north Indian state of Assam a few years ago. There, NRC led to hundreds of thousands, primarily Muslims, being rounded up and detained in detention centres or forced to face citizenship tribunals, with some deported to Bangladesh. The BJP has denied any irregularities in the SIR process, calling it a routine administrative exercise to “cleanse” the electoral roll of “infiltrators”, a term mostly referring to Muslims coming illegally from neighbouring Bangladesh. Responding to Gandhi in parliament, the home minister, Amit Shah, said the BJP was protecting India’s democracy with a policy of “detect, delete and deport”. “Can a country’s democracy be safe when the prime minister and chief minister are decided by illegal immigrants?” he added. The electoral commission (EC), the government body conducting the survey, has said SIR is a means to ensure that deceased, illegitimate and duplicate voters are removed from the voter register. However, in parliament Gandhi accused the EC of being controlled by the BJP and “colluding with those in power to shape elections”. SIR already provoked a significant backlash and a slew of legal challenges when it was carried out in Bihar, a state of 130 million people, earlier this year. More than 6.5 million people were removed from the voter list as a result. The EC had claimed it was because they were dead or had moved away, but many turned out to be alive, and it resulted in millions of complaints. Opposition parties alleged that many of those removed were Muslims or belonged to communities that do not form the vote bank of the Hindu nationalist BJP, while other names were added erroneously, a claim the EC has denied. In the Bihar state election that took place in November after the SIR process was completed, the BJP won by a historic landslide. Nowhere has SIR been more controversial than in West Bengal, the state neighbouring Bangladesh, which has a high number of Muslims. The ruling Trinamool Congress party (TMC) government, led by the chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, has described SIR as a “politically motivated” process to “capture West Bengal by trickery”. West Bengal is one of the few states where the BJP has so far but state elections are due next year. Banerjee also alleged that the “shadow of fear and uncertainty” being created by SIR has led to panic and distress among the people, creating a widespread fear among the state’s Muslims that they will lose their citizenship. TMC has linked the stress of SIR to multiple deaths and suicides that have taken place in the state in recent weeks, and Banerjee wrote to the EC to intervene and halt the process. Among those left in extreme stress was Jahir Mal, who lived in a mud-walled, plastic-roofed shack in Khalisani, 25 miles (40km) west of Kolkata with his wife and children. After news of the electoral revision exercise spread, his family recounted how he began watching SIR-related videos on Facebook warning of mass expulsion and then stopped going to work and isolated himself from family and neighbours. An illiterate Muslim labourer, he feared that as he was not on the electoral list, he would immediately be deemed an illegal citizen by SIR – despite being born in India. “He kept asking, ‘What will I do if they send me to Bangladesh? I have no connection there’,” recounted his wife, Rejina. “I begged him to calm down and assured him nothing would happen … But he wouldn’t listen. “On November 4, the SIR officials were scheduled to arrive at 10am to check the documents. At 9am, when no one else was home, my husband took his life.” Now Rejina is left alone with their three young children, the family’s sole breadwinner gone. “I don’t know how we will survive. I am broken,” she said. The government has denied that the SIR discriminates against Muslims. But critics have pointed to inflammatory comments made by local BJP leaders such as Suvendu Adhikari, who said Hindus who fled persecution in Bangladesh were “welcome” and would receive citizenship passed by the BJP in 2019, whereas Muslims from the same country were “infiltrators” whose names would be detected and deleted. Bangladeshi Hindus living in India without documents confirmed to the Guardian they had been given assurances by local BJP leaders that SIR would not result in them being detained or deported as infiltrators, despite their illegal status. Bikash Das, a Hindu from Bangladesh, said he had come to India 10 years ago, and despite not being an official citizen had managed to obtain an Indian ID and vote in the past two elections. He said SIR had initially caused him concern that he and his family would be deported. “Then, some local BJP leaders reassured us that we would definitely be granted Indian citizenship,” he said. The SIR process has also sparked anger and protest in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which have been ruled by opposition parties for decades and where the BJP has been attempting to make electoral inroads. In Tamil Nadu, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party has formally opposed the exercise. In Kerala, the Communist party of India (Marxist)-led government passed a resolution against SIR, condemning it as a “citizenship survey” by the backdoor. Though it was due to be completed by early December, the SIR deadline for many states has been pushed back by several weeks. The final voter lists are due to be published in February 2026.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/japan-defence-budget-china,Japan’s cabinet approves record defence budget amid escalating China tensions,2025-12-26T06:16:07.000Z,"Japanese strike-back capabilities and coastal defences to be boosted while Beijing accuses Tokyo of fuelling a ‘space arms race’ Japan’s cabinet has approved a record high defence budget as tensions with continue to spiral, with Beijing this week accusing Tokyo of “fuelling a space arms race”. The draft defence budget for the next fiscal year – approved on Friday – is more than ¥9tn ($58bn) and 9.4% bigger than the previous budget, which will end in April. The increase comes in the fourth year of Japan’s five-year program to double its annual arms spending to 2% of GDP. The budget plan focuses on fortifying strike-back capability and coastal defences with surface-to-ship missiles and unmanned arsenals. To defend the coasts, Japan will spend ¥100bn yen to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillance and defence under a system called “Shield” planned for March 2028, defence ministry officials said. between the Chinese and Japanese governments. Beijing has consistently objected to Japan’s strengthening defensiveness, but relations imploded last month when Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, said Japan if China attacked Taiwan as part of Beijing’s plans to annex the territory. Takaichi’s remarks sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, of diplomatic and economic retaliatory moves. Takaichi , and the government has maintained they represented no change to Japan’s defence policies. Chinese government officials have continued to publicly rail against Tokyo, seizing on any military-related announcement. On Thursday China’s defence ministry told a regular press briefing that Japan’s recent space technology developments – some of which are in cooperation with the US – were “accelerating the weaponisation and militarisation of space, and fuelling a space arms race”. Tokyo has launched several rockets since March 2023, carrying cargo spacecraft and satellites for GPS systems and intelligence gathering, according to Japanese media. “Given that Japan’s vicious militarists once launched sneak attacks and that the country is now taking an offensive space policy, it is hardly surprising that there are growing concerns of another Pearl Harbor scenario,” defence ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said on Sunday. Japan’s postwar constitution forbids it from using force as a means of settling international disputes but a – passed when Takaichi’s mentor, Shinzo Abe, was prime minister – permits it to exercise collective self-defence in certain situations, even if it is not directly under attack. Japan’s current security strategy identifies China as the country’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more assertive role in its security cooperations with the US. On Thursday, China’s defence ministry also blasted the US over its continued support for Taiwan, a week after it approved a of more than $10bn. The US doesn’t recognise Taiwan diplomatically but is Taiwan’s most significant supporter in resisting Chinese annexation threats, and is mandated under US law to provide it with the means to defend itself. Last week the US senate also passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authorisation to spend up to $1bn in 2026 on Taiwan-related security cooperation. Zhang accused the US of “emboldening Taiwan independence” activity and undermining peace and stability. China is in the midst of a years-long overhaul and modernisation of its military, geared in large part towards being able to take Taiwan by force. Beijing claims Taiwan is a province that must be “reunified” with the mainland, but an overwhelming majority of Taiwan’s people reject the prospect. Its rapidly growing navy and air force are venturing further out beyond their borders, and have been involved in multiple incidents with other militaries. on Japanese aircraft during drills near south-western Japan, prompting Tokyo to protest. Locking radar is considered one of the most threatening acts a military aircraft can take because it signals a potential attack, forcing the targeted aircraft to take evasive action. Zhang said China’s defence expenditure was reasonable and moderate, and its activities were “fully in compliance with international law”.",Helen Davidson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retailers and property investors are reallocating capital back into physical stores, according to the property group Knight Frank. The switch represents a fillip for high streets and shopping centres after a , which culminated in the shutdown of most stores during pandemic lockdowns and an accompanying The growth in online retail has fallen back and flatlined at between 26% and 28% of overall retail sales since a peak of 35% in mid-2020. Retail has outperformed all other types of commercial property this year, with 9.2% returns on investments in the year to September, Knight Frank said. This is ahead of industrial properties, at 9.1% and offices at 3.2%. Shopping centres and food stores are the joint top performers this year, each delivering 10.2% growth in returns. Shopping centres are now seeking to attract visitors with “experiences” and , to complement shops. While large centres tend to do well, smaller, older malls are suffering because retail chains’ preference for fewer larger stores, Knight Frank said. Next year, retail property is forecast to deliver investment returns of 9.5%. Will Lund, the head of retail capital markets at Knight Frank, said: “With online penetration flatlining and retailers reinvesting in physical space, the narrative around retail has fundamentally changed. We have great confidence that this demand is going to drive a return to decade-high investment volumes in 2026 and we are expecting a busy year.” In November, the chief executive of the commercial property development and investment company Landsec, Mark Allan, said over the next 12 to 18 months, in a Landsec, which owns and manages large shopping centres such as Bluewater in Kent and Trinity Leeds, has sold £295m of offices as it shifts towards retail and residential.

Knight Frank estimated that £5.8bn was invested in retail assets in 2025, down 17% from the previous year because of a shortage of properties. Transaction levels rose in the second half if the year, and with pricing strengthening, that momentum is expected to carry into 2026. Charlie Barke, the head of capital markets at Knight Frank, said: “We’ve got fewer willing sellers because people are expecting these assets to start to perform well again. So stock supply to the market is limited for the first time in quite a long time, and now demand for investments exceeds supply in the retail sector.” Across the country, 13.5% of shops stand empty, the lowest vacancy rate since 2020, with a further drop expected next year.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/former-malaysian-pm-najib-razak-found-guilty-of-abuse-of-power-in-latest-1mdb-trial,Former Malaysian PM Najib Razak jailed for 15 more years in 1MDB graft scandal,2025-12-26T16:35:03.000Z,"New conviction over plunder of state fund substantially increases six-year term in separate case The jailed former Malaysian prime minister has been sentenced to an additional 15 years after he was found guilty of abuse of power, in the biggest trial yet in the multibillion-dollar fraud scandal related to the state fund 1MDB. Najib’s conviction substantially increases the six-year prison term he is already serving for a separate case related to the graft scandal, one of the world’s biggest financial frauds in which billions were plundered from the now defunct sovereign wealth fund. In the latest case, Najib had been charged with four counts of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of about 2.2bn ringgit ($544.15m) from 1MDB. He has consistently denied wrongdoing in the scandal, which dented Malaysia’s image abroad. Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah, who was presiding, convicted Najib, 72, on all four counts of abuse of power. The former PM will also face a verdict on 21 counts of money laundering linked to the fund, which prompted investigations in several countries, from Singapore to the US. The judge said in his verdict: “The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch-hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.” Malaysian and US investigators say at least $4.5bn was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1bn allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has denied wrongdoing. The ruling could add to tensions in the prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim’s, governing alliance, which includes the once dominant United Malays National Organisation, over which Najib, its former leader, has retained significant influence. , when Malaysia’s top court upheld a corruption conviction for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board. Najib is the son of one of the country’s founding fathers and was groomed for leadership from a young age until his spectacular fall from power. He had been seen as untouchable until public anger over the 1MDB corruption scandal led to the 2018 election defeat of his ruling party, which had governed since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. Prosecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chair to move large amounts of money from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago. According to investigators, proceeds from the state fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks. Najib has repeatedly said he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier Jho Low, who has been charged in the US for his central role in the case. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has denied wrongdoing. The judge dismissed several of the defence lawyers’ arguments, including that Najib was duped by Low, his close associate. He also dismissed arguments that the money flowing into Najib’s accounts was “donations” from Middle East funders, calling it a “tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights”. The prosecution presented bank records, testimony from more than 50 witnesses and documentary evidence. Najib “paints himself as a victim of rogue subordinates, when in truth, he was the single most powerful decision maker”, the deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib told the court during closing arguments. “The accused wielded absolute financial, executive and political control,” he said. Najib has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but maintains he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund. His legal battle was dealt a blow on Monday after he lost an application to serve the remainder of his first jail term at home rather than the Kajang prison, outside Kuala Lumpur.",Angelique Chrisafis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/italian-village-first-baby-in-30-years,A child is born: Italians celebrate village’s first baby in 30 years,2025-12-26T10:00:07.000Z,"Feted birth of bambina Lara in Pagliara dei Marsi highlights sticky national debate over country’s ‘demographic winter’ In Pagliara dei Marsi, an ancient rural village on the slopes of Mount Girifalco in Italy’s Abruzzo region, cats vastly outnumber people. They weave through the narrow streets, wander in and out of homes, and stretch out on walls overlooking the mountains. Their purrs are a consistent hum in the quiet that has come with decades of population decline. But less so since March, when rapturous celebrations marked a rare occurrence: the birth of a child. Lara Bussi Trabucco is the first baby to have been born in Pagliara dei Marsi in almost 30 years, bringing the village’s population to roughly 20. Her christening in the church opposite her home was attended by the entire community – including the cats – and such is the novelty of having a baby in the village, she is now the main tourist attraction. “People who didn’t even know Pagliara dei Marsi existed have come, only because they had heard about Lara,” said her mother, Cinzia Trabucco. “At just nine months old, she’s famous.” Lara’s arrival is a symbol of hope, but also a sobering reminder of Italy’s worsening demographic crisis. In 2024, births in the country reached a historic low of 369,944, continuing a 16-year negative trend, according to figures , the national statistics agency. The fertility rate also fell to a record low, with an average 1.18 children born to women of child-bearing age in 2024 – one of the lowest in the EU. Reasons for the decline are myriad, from job insecurity and the huge wave of to inadequate support for working mothers and, as in other countries, the are simply choosing to not have children. Istat’s preliminary data for the first seven months of 2025 points to a further decrease, and of Italy’s 20 administrative regions, nowhere has it been more acute than in the already sparsely populated Abruzzo, which between January and July had a 10.2% drop in the number of births compared with the same period in 2024. Pagliara dei Marsi is tiny, but it is emblematic of a country-wide landscape that is becoming dominated by , putting pressure on public finances and presenting daunting economic and social challenges for leaders at local, regional and national levels. “Pagliara dei Marsi has been suffering from drastic depopulation, exacerbated by the loss of many elderly people, without any generational turnover,” said the local mayor, Giuseppina Perozzi. Perozzi, who lives a few doors away from baby Lara, said she was grateful to Trabucco, 42, and her partner, Paolo Bussi, 56, for starting a family and hopes it will inspire others to do the same. Their situation is uncommon. Trabucco, a music teacher, was born in Frascati, close to Rome, and worked in the Italian capital for years before deciding to move to the village where her grandfather was born because she had always wanted to raise a family far from the chaos of a city. She met Bussi, a construction worker from the area, a few years ago. The couple benefited from a €1,000 “baby bonus” after Lara’s birth, a one-time payment for each child born or adopted since January 2025, introduced by as part of its pledge to tackle what the prime minister has called Italy’s “demographic winter”. They also receive a child benefit payment of about €370 a month. But their main struggle is juggling childcare around work. Italy’s childcare support system is chronically insufficient and Meloni’s administration, despite depicting the birthrate crisis as a battle for national survival, has so far fallen short in its promise to boost the number of nurseries. Many women who become pregnant are forced to leave the workforce and later struggle to re-enter. The couple worry about Lara’s future schooling, too. The last time Pagliara dei Marsi had a teacher – whose home doubled-up as the school – was decades ago. There is an infant and primary school in nearby Castellafiume, but given the across Italy due to the birthrate decline, it remains to be seen whether there will be enough children to sustain the facility over the long term. Trabucco said financial incentives were not enough to stymie the trend. “The entire system needs to be revolutionised,” she added. “We’re a country of high taxes but this does not translate into a good quality of life or good social services.” About an hour’s drive from Pagliara dei Marsi is Sulmona, a once-thriving city where the hastened pace of depopulation over the past decade has led to a battle to save its maternity unit, located at Annunziata hospital, from closure. The unit, which serves the city and nearby towns, delivered 120 babies in 2024, well below the 500 required for maternity units to maintain funding. If it closes, pregnant women would need to travel to L’Aquila, the regional capital, about an hour’s drive away, posing risks in emergency situations. “The region is vast and especially in winter, travel conditions can be treacherous,” said Gianluca Di Luigi, a gynaecologist at the hospital who recalled a woman in labour who got stuck in a snow storm for eight hours. “By the time we got her to the hospital, we had to do an emergency caesarean. This was her first child and she was traumatised by the whole experience.” Those fighting to keep the unit open argue that the figure of 500 births a year, established in 2010, is no longer realistic. “We never did reach the magic 500 here,” said Berta Gambina, a midwife who has worked in the unit for 39 years. “Even in the best of times, we averaged about 380 births a year. But I will do all I can to keep it open – my biggest fear is abandoning pregnant women.” Ornella La Civita, a city councillor with the centre-left Democratic party, said financial incentives to encourage births were welcome. “But how can you give women money to have babies but not guarantee them a safe and secure place to give birth?” One often overlooked topic in Italy’s birthrate debate is preserving fertility, said Di Luigi, through means such as freezing eggs. “Ideological thinking in Italy has always been a block,” he added. “But if we want newborns, then we need enlightenment too – yes, provide young people with dignified jobs but let’s start teaching them about preserving fertility.”",Angela Giuffrida,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/28/las-vegas-police-free-tesla-cybertrucks,How Las Vegas police ended up with a fleet of free Tesla Cybertrucks,2025-12-27T13:00:39.000Z,"Mysterious donors gave a fleet of 10 of the vehicles – which have had a number of recalls – to the police earlier this year police department rolled out a new fleet of tactical vehicles to city streets last month: all Tesla Cybertrucks. The steel cars, wrapped in black-and-white vinyl, come decked out with warning lights and flashing sirens on the roof. They seem to be heftier, more angular versions of a traditional police car. Las Vegas is the first city in the US to grant its officers access to a battalion of the futuristic trucks, which have become synonymous with the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, the richest person in the world. “They represent something far bigger than just a police car,” Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a recent showcasing the vehicles. “They represent innovation.” News of the 10 electric Cybertrucks first rippled across Las Vegas in February when McMahill of the cars on X, saying “These are badass” and announcing his force would soon be driving them. Another police department on Instagram said the fleet “was entirely donated by an anonymous supporter”. Rumors swirled about who the donor could be. It came at a time when Tesla’s sales had tanked and Musk was laying waste to the federal government’s payroll as the head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). According to police department emails acquired by the Guardian through a public records request, the donation had been in the works since the month after Donald Trump’s election win. “As we’ve discussed, the use of these vehicles would represent a groundbreaking approach to modern policing,” Mike Gennaro, the chief of staff for the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, wrote in an email to the donor on 1 December 2024. The mysterious donor turned out to be Ben Horowitz, co-founder of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and his wife Felicia Horowitz. They came forward just days after McMahill posted the renderings on social media. Horowitz’s firm, one of the best-known in Silicon Valley, invests in a variety of tech companies and spent $400m to help Musk take over Twitter in 2022. In reaction to the news, Musk replied to a post about it on X with an emoji wearing sunglasses. Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, said that police use of these Cybertrucks seemed like an endorsement of Musk. “I recognize that LVMPD sees value in having cool-looking vehicles around, and it projects an air of modernity and sophistication. But the reality is that for communities, that’s not what they’re asking for,” Haseebullah said. “They’re asking to feel safer. I don’t know that a Tesla Cybertruck makes anybody feel any safer.” Other cities around the US have also faced blowback at the prospect of adding Teslas to government-owned fleets. Baltimore had pledged to spend $5m on Tesla sedans for municipal employees in June 2024, but by March had . In King county, Washington, officials faced for buying 120 Tesla vehicles for its municipal carpooling program. And in a handful of small towns in California, where officers have been testing Tesla sedans for law enforcement work, department chiefs say the vehicles The Las Vegas police department, however, is optimistic. McMahill said zero taxpayer dollars were spent on the Cybertrucks because they were a donation. The Horowitzes live in Las Vegas and have been longtime supporters of the city’s police department. According to the emails acquired by the Guardian, their Cybertruck donation included 10 vehicles for patrolling and one “sting protector” for special weapons and tactics (Swat). The donation, which is and was finalized in late January 2025, was funnelled through a law enforcement charity called Behind the Blue. “The morale of the cops will be through the roof when these show up at their substations,” Gennaro wrote to Horowitz, as they hammered out the donation logistics. “And we will use them as a tool to keep morale high and cops productive.” The police department waited for the Cybertrucks for about 10 months as they underwent upgrades by a company called UpFit, based in Hawthorne, California, which specializes in retrofitting Teslas for police work. The patrol vehicles come with barrier shields, ladders, radios and other tactical gear, according to the police department. The upgrade specifics and pricing were redacted in public records. According to internal emails, the Swat vehicle will be used in situations that include “barricaded suspects and hostage incidents”. Las Vegas police asked UpFit to remove Tesla’s “beast” mode on all 11 vehicles. Beast mode is a setting that Tesla says makes a Cybertruck accelerate from zero to 60mph in 2.6 seconds and can reach a top speed of 130mph. Horowitz has made several tech-centric donations to the Las Vegas police department over the past couple of years, totalling roughly $8m. Those include license plate readers from the company Flock, drones from Skydio and an artificial intelligence tool that helps with 911 calls from the company Prepared911. These three products were created by businesses within Andreessen Horowitz’s investment portfolio, . The firm is not an investor in Tesla. In response to TechCrunch’s reporting, Horowitz wrote a emphasizing the need for public safety and quoted the rapper Nas, saying: “You can hate me now, but I won’t stop now.” Horowitz and Tesla did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Musk has touted the Cybertruck’s stainless steel body as being “apocalypse-proof” with the ability to . During his unveiling of the vehicle in 2019, he had one of his staffers throw a metal ball at the car’s window to show off what he said was “a truck that’s really tough, not fake tough”. Cybertrucks have been on public roads for two years now. They have dedicated fans, but have seen dwindling sales and are banned from the European market over pedestrian safety issues. In the third quarter of this year, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks – down 63% from the same time last year. For comparison, the Ford F-150, a similar oversized electric truck, saw sales rise by nearly 40% in the third quarter. Some of the lackluster sales come from opposition to Musk during his time at Doge. “Tesla Takedown” protests last winter were aimed at getting people to sell their cars and a . Vandals around the country spray-painted swastikas on the pickup trucks, and, in Seattle, someone set four of the vehicles on fire, engulfing them in flames. Cybertrucks have also had a staggering number of recalls over the last two years. Among the 10 recalls, issues included side panelling that’s prone to flying off while driving, too bright front lights and a gas pedal that accelerates uncontrollably. The most recent recall, issued on 30 October, was due to the truck’s light bar being susceptible to falling off and causing a road hazard to other vehicles. “Why didn’t they pick any other type of vehicle?” Haseebullah from the ACLU of Nevada asked. “Why would a Tesla be more efficient for police to utilize than a Ford?” The Las Vegas police department said it dealt with those recalls before deploying its Cybertrucks on patrol last month. For Sheriff McMahill, using these trucks is about having “the most technologically advanced police department on the planet”. “These trucks are high performance and they’re built tough,” McMahill said, echoing Ford’s “Built tough” tagline. “Cops are going to look kinda cool in them too.”",Dara Kerr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Airstrikes have been accompanied by heightening Israeli rhetoric in recent weeks, as a deadline for the Lebanese army to clear all of Hezbollah’s arms from south of the Litani River grows closer. “There will be no calm in Beirut, nor order and stability in Lebanon, until the security of the state of Israel is guaranteed … Hezbollah: we will disarm them,” Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, told parliament in November. Under a US-approved plan adopted by the Lebanese army, by year’s end, the Lebanese army is meant to clear all Hezbollah infrastructure, weapons and personnel from the area south of the Litani, about 20 miles from the country’s border with Israel. Israeli forces are meant to withdraw from the country, though its troops continue to occupy five points in the south and regularly conduct ground operations there. Lebanese officials say they have all but finished with the disarmament of Hezbollah in the south and regularly blow up old weapons caches from the group. The deputy prime minister, Tarek Mitri, said on 17 December that the government was nearly done with disarmament in the south and said while Lebanon was “strictly observing” the ceasefire, that Israel continually violated it. Israel has rejected the claim, however, and says that Hezbollah is attempting to rebuild itself along its borders. On Monday, an Israeli drone strike killed three men in a car 10 miles south of the Lebanese city of Saida, far north of the Litani. Israel claimed that one of the men killed, who was a warrant officer in the Lebanese army, was also a member of Hezbollah and was involved in planning attacks on Israel. It further pointed to the presence of a Hezbollah member in the army as proof that the Lebanese state was not doing enough to combat the group. The Lebanese army and Hezbollah denied the soldier had any connection to the armed group, with Lebanon’s defence minister, Michel Menassa, saying the accusation was a “malicious attack” on the army. Israeli media has reported that one of the topics on the agenda in an expected meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and US president, Donald Trump, is an expanded offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon. As Israeli airstrikes continue on south Lebanon, Israeli and Lebanese officials continue to meet in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura to discuss the status of the ceasefire. Last Friday, the delegations included civilian representatives for the second time, drawing outrage in Lebanon, which said inclusion of civilian negotiators was paramount to recognition of Israel – a taboo in Lebanese politics. The civilian representatives were meant to discuss nonmilitary issues, such as the potential economic cooperation between the two countries. Israel said it considers the diplomatic engagement with the Lebanese state to be separate from its military attacks on Hezbollah and is pushing forward on both tracks. The Lebanese state has continually appealed to the international community for help to stop what it said were near-daily attacks on its sovereignty.",William Christou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had instructed the military to respond forcefully in the West Bank town of Qabatiya, from which, he said, the assailant had come, in order to thwart any further attacks. It is common for Israel to launch raids in the West Bank towns from which attackers have come and demolish homes belonging to their families. Israel says that helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevent future attacks. Rights watchdogs say such actions are collective punishment. The Israeli military said it was “preparing for an operation” in the area. The Israeli ambulance service confirmed a man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene after medics were unable to resuscitate them. A teenager was also hurt in the attack, they said. An Israeli reservist soldier was meanwhile reportedly under house arrest on Friday after he rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The reservist acted “in severe violation of his authority” and his weapon had been confiscated and his service terminated, the Israeli military said. The man who was rammed was checked in hospital, but was unhurt and was now at home.

She took her GCSEs at The Excel Academy in 2023 before completing a foundation year at City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College (SFC) and then studying economics, politics and statistics for one year. But the 19-year-old said that when she ran into difficulty with her subjects, teachers tried to persuade her to study Russian instead. As her father is a Ukrainian soldier, she felt this would be a traumatising experience, and that the request was “hurtful and insensitive” and akin to “discrimination and racism”. Endeberia has since dropped out of SFC, and is instead studying at home using notes shared by friends. She has applied to sit A-level exams as a private candidate in 2026, at a cost of £1,400. She told the Guardian that studying Russian was “against my personal principle because I was born [in Donetsk] where the war started in 2014. It’s not a language I want to speak or study because my father became a soldier last year”. She added: “I am truly grateful for the opportunity to study in the United Kingdom – it feels like my third home [after and the Czech Republic, where she initially moved]. But not everyone realises how challenging it can be for Ukrainian students to adapt to a new education system, culture and language after everything our country has gone through.” Endeberia said she struggled on her A-level courses and felt she was being bullied because of her accent. She claims the college did not provide her with extra support but instead tried to persuade her to take up A-level Russian. “Rather than offering empathy or help, they continued to insist that I change subjects. No one tried to understand how painful this experience was for me,” she said. She said she had struggled to obtain “clear answers” about why she has been prevented from pursuing politics, economics and statistics, and is pursuing a complaints process through Potteries Educational Trust, which oversees SFC. She plans to escalate the case to Ofsted once this is completed. A spokesperson for City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College said: “The college cares deeply about our students and every effort is made to resolve issues and complaints in accordance with our complaints and resolution process.

The suspected gunman, Cláudio Valente, and one of those killed, Nuno FG Loureiro, studied at the prestigious and notoriously challenging University of Lisbon engineering and technology school, known locally as Técnico, both graduating in 2000. Contemporaries of the two men describe the academic environment as emotionally gruelling. Only one was willing to go on the record, but several others expressed similar opinions. Valente was described as brilliant and competitive, but willing to help his colleagues out. He finished top of his class, with an average grade of 19 out of 20, an unusually high score for Técnico. Loureiro, who was said to be an excellent student but more easygoing than Valente, finished with an average grade of 16 out of 20. Classmates say that, at the time, the two men appeared socially well adjusted. Nuno Morais, 48, now a researcher at the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine in Lisbon, said he and his fellow classmates, shaken by the news of Loureiro’s killing, had been “racking their brains” for any signs that something was wrong. “Having known Cláudio and having had a good relationship with him, we can’t find any other explanation than a serious mental health problem – exacerbated by resentment for not having achieved the academic career he dreamed of,” he said. Soon after his graduation in Lisbon, Valente enrolled at Brown University as a promising young doctoral student of physics, but dropped out after a few months in early 2001 and returned to Portugal to work as a programmer for an internet provider. Loureiro studied at Imperial College London and then Princeton University, later working at the UK’s Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. He joined MIT in 2016 as a professor of nuclear science and engineering, eventually becoming the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at the institute. Valente and Loureiro’s classmates said they suspected that the highly competitive atmosphere of academia may have taken a mental toll. “I don’t remember any specific situations directly involving Nuno and Cláudio during our graduate degree, but the culture in these schools remains the same – a hyper-competitive environment where students who struggle are humiliated and made to feel they can only succeed if they are the best of the best,” said Morais. According to his peers, Valente was crushed by his failure to complete his PhD. Morais said: “The only connection I can make with Cláudio’s trajectory and what happened was his disappointment with the experience at Brown. Those of us who work in academia dream of pursuing a PhD at a major American university. Cláudio aspired to have a brilliant academic career, comparable to Nuno’s, and this dream was prematurely destroyed, generating frustration.” . He said his current work included mentoring and supporting students, which had made him aware of how normalised emotional distress and high pressure are in academia. He said that over the years higher-education institutions such as MIT and Caltech had taken steps to relieve student pressure because of high suicide rates. Portugal lags on this matter, he said. “Portuguese schools now have therapist offices to assist students, but there’s a great delay in fighting bullying and harassment inside the institutions. The prevailing culture is still one in which senior figures behave in ways that are prejudicial to mental health and that continues to be tolerated. Tragedies like this should prompt us to think very carefully,” Morais said. A spokesperson for Técnico said the school was not aware of any connection between the shootings and Valente and Loureiro’s time at the university. “From what we have been reading in the media, they seemed to have a normal, collegial relationship. We are unable to see how something that happened 30 years ago can be connected to what happened now, but the school is going to come together to reflect and discuss,” they said. Valente returned to the US in 2017 through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme and was granted a green card. He was living in Miami. On Friday morning, after Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced she had paused the visa scheme under Trump’s direction to “ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme”. “This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she wrote in her social media statement. Such comments, and the Trump administration’s subsequent move to further narrow the pathways to legal immigration using the crime as a pretext, caused outrage among Valente and Loureiro’s peers. Morais said: “[This puts] the focus of the problem in the wrong place. Access to weapons and the hyper-competitive culture of some universities are closer to the root causes of these shootings than migration.”",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their miraculous spots do not indicate poison, as people sometimes assume, but are thought to be used as a mode of communication, according to Rajkumar K P, a Zoological Society of London fellow and researcher. In early 2020, he found seven members of the “magical” species in in India, but could not visit them during the Covid pandemic. When he went back later, the frogs had disappeared, according to a report from the ZSL. “The big beautiful fallen log that was there was completely broken and misplaced,” Rajkumar said. The vegetation was also trampled, and the frogs, whose homes had been destroyed, were nowhere to be found. At first he suspected brown mongooses of causing the damage, but they are not strong enough to overturn a log. Then he asked his tracker if he had seen anyone. “He mentioned there were a couple of photographers visiting that location. Several small groups. So later I contacted my other trackers, and they started telling me everything that had happened.” These nature photographers had been turning over logs in their search for the endangered species, according to the trackers. When they found them, they would capture and prop up the frogs for photos. But they didn’t wear gloves, even though these delicate creatures breathe through their skin and are incredibly sensitive. One tracker told Rajkumar that two small galaxy frogs had died after being handled for too long by photographers. “He said they would take the animal to some nice background or mossy log to take the photograph, relocating it from one place to another to get better photos. On that day they got five or six frogs and two of them died.” Searching again and again at the site in the following months, Rajkumar could not find any more galaxy frogs. He felt “helpless” in the face of the injustice. “The forest department officers try to prevent these kinds of groups coming. But they use higher officials – politicians, high court judges, or something like that – to allow them to take photographs,” he said. “I fell in love with these frogs after seeing them. You feel like they’re jet black in colour, but when you put them under light you can find all the stars – like galaxies on their bodies. It’s just magical.” Dr Benjamin Tapley, ZSL’s curator of reptiles and amphibians, said the galaxy frogs are likely an “ancient”, “irreplaceable” branch on the tree of life. “I grimace every time I see a photo come up on my feed of a galaxy frog,” said Tapley. “I just wonder what happened? How was that taken? How was the habitat impacted? “We’re really hopeful that we can encourage people to act more ethically so that incredible species like the galaxy frog can continue to thrive for millions more years.”",Isaaq Tomkins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nest, found recently on the north coast, was too close to the water’s edge and the eggs needed to be moved to save them from being inundated by waves and the tides. Loggerhead turtles are endangered, with very few nesting females in NSW, making every egg precious. Green turtles are listed as a vulnerable species. TurtleWatch NSW’s Merryn Dunleavy said every nest reported would be safeguarded “and the commitment and care from our coastal communities will be essential in ensuring these nests can survive”. “We are asking beachgoers to become citizen scientists and monitor local beaches along the NSW coastline, from the Tweed to Batemans Bay, looking for nesting sea turtles,” she said. “Walk your local beach early in the morning along the high tide line – as sea turtles generally nest during the night from dusk until dawn – looking for turtle tracks in the sand.” After the first nest was spotted by a member of the public, trained and licensed TurtleWatch staff carefully placed the eggs into one of the cooler-box incubators used during last season’s incubation success. There were successful hatchings from a record 18 sea turtle nests last season. Earlier in 2025, ex-tropical cyclone Alfred reshaped large stretches of the northern NSW coastline, causing many beaches to lose gently rising sandy shores. Some dunes were cut back several metres, reducing suitable nesting habitat by creating steep drop-offs that nesting females cannot climb. Because of the turtle team’s vigilance in February, National Parks and Service and TurtleWatch staff rescued more than 1,000 eggs from nine nests ahead of the cyclone. After hatching they were released at their original nest sites, with 1,020 hatchlings swimming free. Prompt reporting of turtle tracks, low-lying nests and community awareness are key to protecting eggs and giving them the best chance to successfully hatch. Tracks are usually 80 to 100cm wide and can sometimes be mistaken for tyre tracks. TurtleWatch needs volunteers to assist with the nesting season, which runs from November to March along the NSW coastline.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Videos issued on Friday by media linked to the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) showed airstrikes that it said were close to its positions in Wadi Nahab, Hadramaut province. The strikes – which were not independently confirmed – would be the first military step by Saudi Arabia since it made a diplomatic appeal urging the separatist forces to relinquish newly captured Hadramaut and al-Mahra. Amr al-Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the STC, said in a statement to the Associated Press that airstrikes came after its fighters in eastern Hadramaut were involved in ambushes that left two dead. Officials in Saudi Arabia have not so far commented. Two weeks ago, the STC – a longstanding voice calling for to return to the pre-1990 settlement of a Yemen divided into north and south – entered the two large, oil-rich provinces in the south not yet under its control. The capture of the huge governorates of Hadramaut and al-Mahra, the province bordering Oman, occurred without much sign of resistance, as the Hadramaut forces retreated in the face of well-armed STC troops. Since then, the Saudi-backed and UN-recognised elements in Yemen’s divided southern government have been trying to mount a political and diplomatic counteroffensive against “STC unilateralism”, arguing that there is no support across the south for the STC’s call for separation from the north. European countries and Gulf states such as Kuwait and Qatar, as well as the Arab League secretary general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, have called for Yemen to remain a unified country – backing the Saudi position – but the US has said little so far. Europe has voiced concerns that fractures within the south would divert energy away from the struggle to oust , who have run the north of Yemen since 2015, including the former capital, Sana’a. The STC said the UN-recognised government had done little to take the battle to the , and that a separated, cohesive south would be a more effective bulwark against the Iranian-backed Houthis, and would be better equipped to protect the ports along Yemen’s southern coast. There were demonstrations on Thursday in the south-western port city of Aden calling for the STC president, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, to declare independence, a step he is considering. On Thursday, the Saudi ministry of foreign affairs issued a conciliatory but firm statement calling for the STC to withdraw and to reopen negotiations with the remnants of the UN-recognised government. Riyadh said unilateral acts harmed the integrity of Yemen, and it insisted it “had prioritised preserving unity and making every effort to reach peaceful solutions to resolve the situation in both governorates”. It added: “The kingdom remains hopeful that the public interest will prevail through ending the escalation by the Southern Transitional Council and the withdrawal of its forces from the two governorates in an urgent and orderly manner. The kingdom stresses the importance of cooperation among all Yemeni factions and components to exercise restraint and avoid any measures that could destabilise security and stability, which may result in undesirable consequences.” In response, the UAE put out a brief statement commending Saudi Arabia’s role “in serving the interests of the Yemeni people and fulfilling their legitimate aspirations for stability and prosperity”. It did not endorse the call for the STC to withdraw, but private discussions over the political preconditions necessary for a withdrawal have been held. Most observers do not believe the STC could survive without UAE military and political endorsement. If the UAE does not, publicly or privately, withdraw its reassurances to back the STC, then the UAE and Saudi Arabia face a major confrontation.",Patrick Wintour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, 10 such subs have been spotted or seized by Spanish police. Until recently, the boats, which cost about €600,000 (£524,000) to build, were used for one-way trips. But with massive cocaine production leading to – wholesale prices have halved to €15,000 (£13,000) a kilo over the past few years – drug-traffickers can no longer afford to consign their vehicles to a “narco-sub graveyard” between the Azores and the Canary Islands. “These semi-submersibles used to head to the area around the Canaries on one-way voyages and they’d then be sunk,” said Alberto Morales, the head of the central narcotics brigade of the Spanish Policía Nacional. “Back then, the cost of the merchandise in comparison with the cost of the vessel still made doing that very worthwhile – they’d be carrying three or four tonnes minimum, so operating that way was very profitable. But what’s happened lately is that the price of the merchandise is really, really low, so the organisations have, logically, had a rethink. “Rather than sink them, what they do now is unload the merchandise and set up a refuelling platform at sea so that the semi-submersibles can head back to the countries they came from and make as many journeys as possible.” Spanish police and customs officers seized 123 tonnes of cocaine last year, up from 118 tonnes in 2023 and 58 tonnes in 2022. In September this year, the Policía Nacional arrested 14 people and seized 3.65 tonnes of cocaine Morales said police had noticed an uptick in over the past two years and a decrease in the use of sailboats to bring drugs to Spain. “Right now, [the organisations] have two basic methods which are merchant ships and semi-submersibles, which allow them to do their transporting at any time of year.” He added that while 10 narco-subs had been logged over the past two decades, the true number in operation was likely to be higher. “Obviously there will have been more than 10,” said Morales. “Logically speaking, we can’t detect everything that reaches the Spanish coast as we have 8,000km of coastline.” He also said although multiple people had confirmed the existence of the “narco-sub graveyard” in the eastern Atlantic, details were scarce. “We don’t have a location; we don’t even have any numbers,” he said. “And even if we did, it would be almost impossible to recover the [subs] because of the depth of the waters. It’s something for the fish to enjoy.” The increasing use and reuse of narco-subs is not the only recent trend to have attracted the attention of Morales and his colleagues. Officers from the brigade’s synthetic drugs and precursors department say they have dismantled more amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA laboratories in over the past two years than in the previous 18. Two labs were raided and put out of business in 2023, followed by six in 2024 and another three so far this year. Drug seizures from those facilities have included more than five tonnes of MDMA, 450kg of amphetamine sulphate and 27kg of methamphetamine. Although the overwhelming majority of synthetic drug manufacture has historically taken place in the Netherlands – where police dismantle about 100 clandestine labs a year – gangs are Officers in the department believe production has outgrown the cramped geographical confines of the Netherlands and spread to countries such as Spain, France and Germany where there is more room to make the drugs and dispose of the waste materials, and where ingredients and drugs are easier to move around. “There are laboratories all over the place – especially in rural areas where there aren’t many people and where things are better from a security point of view,” said one senior officer. He added that as well as paying some locals to keep an eye out for strangers and police, the drug gangs also used drones to watch over their operations. “We’ve been pretty surprised by the synthetic drugs phenomenon because of the numbers of the laboratories we’re dismantling and because of the ,” he said. “These are large-scale production laboratories.”",Sam Jones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Civil society organisations have treated the news with caution and stressed that the releases were insufficient, noting that at least 900 political prisoners remain in the country. The Maduro regime refuses to acknowledge the existence of political prisoners and it had freed, in the early hours of Christmas Day, 99 “citizens who were deprived of their liberty for their participation in acts of violence and incitement to hatred following the electoral process of 28 July 2024”. It framed the move as an expression of its alleged commitment to “peace” and its “unrestricted respect for human rights”, at a moment when the country is facing what it described as an “imperialist siege and multilateral aggression” by the US. Beyond the deployment of about 15,000 troops and a huge naval fleet off Venezuela’s coast, the US has in recent weeks with a “ ” of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country, the seizure of two vessels and the on boats that have killed 105 people in the Caribbean and the Pacific. The prisoner releases followed a period of internal repression, during which the opposition has been left with virtually no prominent figures either free or still in the country – the opposition leader María Corina Machado, for example, is to Norway to receive her Nobel peace prize. In recent weeks alone, a political scientist, an activist and union leaders were arrested, while last week 17-year-old Gabriel José Rodríguez Méndez became the first teenager convicted of “terrorism”, sentenced to 10 years in prison for taking part in across the country after Maduro – backed by electoral and state institutions under his control – declared himself the winner, despite the opposition that its candidate, the retired diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia, had prevailed. He is now living in exile in Spain. As far as is known, no prominent opposition figures who had been detained, nor the 17-year-old Méndez, are among the 99 allegedly released, a group that does include at least three other teenagers. “The selective and discretionary nature of these releases confirms that deprivation of liberty has been used as an instrument of political persecution,” said the NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón in a The NGO acknowledged the “positive impact” of the measure on the lives of those freed, but said it was “clearly insufficient” given that hundreds of political prisoners remain, with estimates ranging from 900 to 1,000.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/28/congress-us-house-censure,Epstein texts and yelling at Trump: US House’s year of censures,2025-12-27T13:00:39.000Z,"Lawmakers spent much of 2025 seeking to reprimand each other – here’s a look back at what sparked such outrage It’s been a year for the history books in the House of Representatives. Lawmakers broke the record for They also spent plenty of time seeking to reprimand each other by passing censures, as the House’s formal mechanism for discipline is known. A search on Congress.gov reveals at least 17 attempts since the start of the year to condemn another lawmaker, in the form of a censure or a less formal disapproval resolution. If a censure resolution is approved by a majority of the chamber, the targeted lawmaker must stand before the House dais as the speaker informs them that they have been punished for their bad behavior. That’s as far as the consequences go – they keep their seat and their right to vote, but perhaps not their reputation. Though almost none of these passed, the flurry grew so intense that by the end of the year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed changing the rules to make it more difficult for censures to succeed. “How about we stop the circular firing squad in the House?” asked Republican Don Bacon, one of the bill’s sponsors. Here’s a look back at the alleged misdeeds at the center of the censure spree: Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace introduced the first censure attempt of the year in February against Democrat Robert Garcia. Mace’s measure accuses Garcia of “inciting violence against a special government employee” – meaning Elon Musk, who was then in Trump’s best graces as the leader of the “department of government efficiency”. The measure cites an instance in which Garcia – in – called Musk a “dick” at a committee hearing, and a comment he made to CNN about how his fellow Democrats should “bring actual weapons to this bar fight” against Musk. The House did not end up voting on it. The newly re-elected Donald Trump appeared to be at the height of his powers when he a joint session of Congress in early March. But Democrat Al Green was not having it. Pumping a walking cane in the air, Green , shouting “he has no mandate”. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, had Green forcibly removed, and three Republicans introduced censure resolutions targeting him. Two days after the speech, the House passed Washington congressman Dan Newhouse’s measure, with 10 Democrats , along with all Republicans. Democratic lawmakers surrounded Green and sang We Shall Overcome as Johnson read the censure. (In response to that scene, Republican congressman Eli Crane proposed, unsuccessfully, another resolution that would have thrown Green off the financial services committee). Newhouse’s resolution remains the only censure to actually win approval in 2025, but the wave of acrimony was far from finished. Four days after Green was censured, Democratic congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan proposed censuring Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who said the following about Green in an interview with a rightwing broadcaster: “For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.” The resolution accused Boebert of using language that is “disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague”, but was not considered on the House floor. In March, Republican congressman Randy Weber of Texas proposed censuring Democratic fellow Texan Jasmine Crockett for calling Greg Abbott – the state’s Republican governor who has used a wheelchair for decades after being paralyzed by a falling tree – “Governor Hot Wheels” and “a hot ass mess”. This also did not come up for a vote. Republicans filed two censure resolutions against New Jersey Democrat LaMonica McIver after she was with felonies following an altercation outside an ICE detention facility in Newark. The resolution introduced by Republican Clay Higgins was brought up in the House, only for Democrats and a handful of Republicans to collaborate in killing it. This would be the first of several instances this year in which small groups of lawmakers crossed party lines to put down a censure attempt. Tennessee Republican Andy Ogles was the target of two censure resolutions over the summer, for discriminatory comments made about the incoming New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani and other Democrats of color. Democrat Shri Thanedar proposed Ogles’s censure in June for social media posts in which he dubbed Mamdani “little muhammad” and called for him to be deported. The following month, Democrat Ritchie Torres introduced a censure resolution after Ogles called Hakeem Jeffries, the African American House minority leader, “Discount Dollar Store Obama”. Neither resolution was put up for a vote. One of only two Muslim women in Congress and the only Somali American, Democrat Ilhan Omar is of Trump and his Republican allies. In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s murder, Mace proposed censuring Omar and booting her off two committees for comments in which she “disparaged” his character as well as those who mourned the conservative activist’s death, according to her resolution. Democrats succeeded in killing it thanks to help from, again, a small group of Republicans. Jeff Hurd, one of four GOP lawmakers to vote the motion down, called Omar’s comments “ghoulish and evil” but : “The right response to reprehensible speech like this isn’t silencing: it’s more speech. That’s what Charlie Kirk believed and practiced, and I agree.” The censure wave peaked in November, when, in the midst of to end the government shutdown, Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez went to the House floor and alleged that fellow Democrat Chuy Garcia orchestrated his retirement in such a way to guarantee that his chief of staff would be elected to replace him. The resolution “disapproves of [his] behavior” for “undermining the process of a free and fair election”, but was not technically a censure. It sparked outrage from some in Perez’s party but ended up passing, with most Republicans and 23 Democrats voting in support. As the bill to compel the release of government-held files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was nearing passage, that Democrat Stacey Plaskett, the non-voting delegate from the US Virgin Islands, had texted with Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing. The GOP saw a moment to make Democrats – who had for months pressed for release of the Epstein files – practice what they preached, and Congressman Ralph Norman proposed . His resolution failed thanks to united Democratic opposition and the votes of three Republicans. Florida Republican Cory Mills was the target of three separate censure resolutions this year that wound up sparking allegations of party leaders scheming to kill competing censure attempts. In response to the attempt to censure McIver, Democrat Yvette Clarke introduced the first resolution in September, which said that Mills had on “several occasions conducted himself in a manner that reflects discredit” on the House, citing reports the congressman abused romantic partners, committed financial misconduct and misrepresented his military service. The congressman denied wrongdoing, and Clarke’s resolution wound up being withdrawn at the same time that a few Republicans joined with Democrats to block the censure of Omar. Clarke filed a substantially similar measure on the same day as the Epstein files vote in November, and the following day, Mace introduced her own censure resolution against Mills. The Florida congressman made a motion to refer Mace’s proposal to the ethics committee rather than bring it up for a vote, which succeeded with the support of many Democrats. That prompted some Republican women to allege that House leaders brokered a deal to protect Mills in exchange for voting down the censure of Plaskett. “This backroom deal shit is swampy, wrong and always deserves to be called out,” Florida Republican Kat Cammack later said.",Chris Stein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/27/london-eye-architect-proposes-14-mile-tidal-power-station-off-somerset-coast,London Eye architect proposes 14-mile tidal power station off Somerset coast,2025-12-27T11:07:04.000Z,"West Somerset Lagoon would harness renewable energy for UK’s AI boom – and create ‘iconic’ arc around Bristol Channel The architect of the London Eye wants to build a vast tidal power station in a 14-mile arc off the coast of that could help Britain meet surging electricity demand to power artificial intelligence – and create a new race track to let cyclists skim over the Bristol Channel. Julia Barfield, who designed the Eye and the i360 observation tower in Brighton, is part of a team that has drawn up the £11bn proposal. It would curve from Minehead to Watchet and use 125 underwater turbines to harness the power of the second-highest tidal range in the world. The proposal comes amid growing concern that rapidly rising use of AI in Britain will drive up carbon emissions unless more renewable energy sources are found. The AI boom is expected to add to sharp increases in demand for electricity across the UK, which the government this month could more than double by 2050. “If the decision is to go ahead with adopting more and more AI – which I am surprised is not being questioned more at a time of climate emergency – then it is going to be better with a renewable energy source,” said Barfield. “Datacentres could double energy demand and this is a predictable and reliable source.” The barrage would not cross the full breadth of the channel but would instead curve to and from the Somerset coast with a 2.5GW maximum output – not far short of the peak energy that will be created by the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station just 12 miles east. It would be enough to power 2m homes. The vision includes a path along the top of the semi-circular barrage for walkers and cyclists willing to brave the south-westerlies, a water-sports marina, a lido and an observation tower. Local MP Rachel Gilmour, who is backing the plan, said the pathway “will become absolutely iconic”. The designers have tentatively suggested it also might be possible to install datacentres within the structure, allowing them to benefit from cheap seawater cooling. There are hopes for oyster and mussel beds, arrays of floating solar panels and a coastal amphitheatre to boost the economy of Minehead, once a popular holiday resort and now The latest UK energy policy states that tidal and wave energy could play a role “if their costs can be reduced”. “We have got people who want to fund it but they will only do so if the government is supportive,” said Aidan Clegg, chief executive of the consortium. “They need to take this seriously. This is not hypothetical – we have a strong plan in place.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are open to considering well-developed proposals for harnessing the tidal range energy in the bays and estuaries around our coastlines, which demonstrate strong value for money. The is bringing together the likes of [the National Energy System Operator], EDF, Microsoft and Google in solving the energy demands of AI, exploring opportunities to attract investment and support the development of low carbon power for datacentres.” Tidal power is more predictable than wind and solar, even though there are several hours when tides turn each day with little or no power. The backers of the project believe it would last 120 years and would therefore produce power more cheaply than nuclear power. It was first conceived several years ago with the aim of reducing the UK’s carbon footprint. Since then, the AI revolution began and is now on course to dramatically increase energy demand. Britain’s national energy system operator, Neso, has electricity demand for datacentres will treble by 2035. The vast racks of microprocessors needed to train and run AI models and store the ever-increasing mountains of data on which the tech-enabled 21st-century economy relies will account for the largest part of the overall increase in electricity demand in the commercial sector. The West Somerset Lagoon is the latest in a line of proposals to harness the tidal power of the Severn estuary. In the 1980s, other lagoons were proposed in the narrower part of the estuary, closer to Bristol, while was suggested more recently, raising concerns about large-scale and irreversible change to the estuary system. The latest sponsors of the idea say the lagoon will not interrupt navigation channels to the ports of Bristol and Cardiff, and is outside protected areas such as local nature reserves and special areas of conservation. “Minehead and that whole area of West Somerset is an area of deprivation and this project will drive positive transformation,” Barfield said. “It will create skilled full-time jobs, an area for water-sports, a lido, a visitors’ centre, an observation tower and cultural facilities. It could also become a hub for marine farming mussels, seaweed and oysters. These are the types of businesses that local young people could develop because the tidal range would be more controlled.”",Robert Booth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/british-egyptian-activist-alaa-abd-el-fattah-arrives-in-uk-after-travel-ban-lifted,British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah arrives in UK after travel ban lifted,2025-12-26T17:57:22.000Z,"Family say campaigner, who has a son in Brighton, will be able to travel freely between UK and Cairo months after his release from Egyptian jail The British-Egyptian dissident Alaa Abd el-Fattah has arrived in London after the Egyptian government lifted a travel ban that it had imposed on him despite Abd el-Fattah had been held in jail nearly continuously for 10 years, mainly due to expressing his opposition to the treatment of dissidents by the Egyptian government. He had been detained in jail two years beyond his five-year sentence as the Cairo authorities refused to recognise the period he held in pre-trial detention as part of his time served. A previous attempt by Abd el-Fattah to leave Cairo for London in November after his release from jail, was blocked by the security forces a month ago. He has since been trying to negotiate an agreement whereby he is allowed to travel freely between Cairo and London and not be permanently excluded from Egypt if he came to the UK. His arrival in London was announced by his mother, Laila Soueif, on Facebook. His sister Mona Seif said: “I can’t believe it’s finally happened and Alaa has made it to London. We thought it was impossible, but here he is. Hundreds of people around the world did so much to help bring this moment about. Alaa is free and we can finally begin to heal as a family.” The family believe the agreement will allow him to travel back and forth between the UK and Egypt. James Lynch of FairSquare, a human rights organisation that has worked alongside Abd el-Fattah’s family for several years, said: “I’m delighted that Alaa has safely returned to the UK to be reunited with his son after such a lengthy ordeal lasting well over a decade. After everything Alaa and his family have been through, I’m hopeful this marks the beginning of a new chapter for them.” His mother twice came close to death when she was admitted to hospital during an extended designed to put pressure on the UK Foreign Office to do more to secure his release. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, , Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end his detention. But the Egyptians never allowed British consular visits to jail, saying they did not recognise his dual citizenship status. Changes in the Egyptian embassy in London may have helped produce a less inflexible stance. Abd el-Fattah, from a family of human rights activists, became a leading voice during the Arab spring. He has a direct, perceptive, non-sectarian writing style that has won him awards. He has a teenage son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton and attends a special educational needs school. The boy visited him in Cairo soon after his release, in what was regarded as a successful reunion. Abd el-Fattah’s sister, Sanaa, explained at the time he had been blocked from flying out of Cairo: “We’re really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly.” “Khaled needs his father. My nephew … is very, very comfortable in his school and his setup in Brighton. We can’t change. We can’t keep creating instability.” He had already served a five-year jail sentence passed in September 2019 on charges of “spreading false news” after a much-criticised trial, yet last year his family were told he would not be released until January 2027. Starmer made no criticism of the justice of Abd el-Fattah’s sentencing. “I’m delighted that Alaa is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief,” the prime minister wrote on social media. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment. “Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office. I’m grateful to President Sisi for his decision to grant the pardon.”",Patrick Wintour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/27/alps-france-skiing-snow-warming-resorts-closing-ceuze-landscape,"‘Ghost resorts’: as hundreds of ski slopes lie abandoned, will nature reclaim the Alps?",2025-12-27T06:48:56.000Z,"With the snow line edging higher, 186 French ski resorts have shut, while global heating threatens dozens more hen Céüze 2000 ski resort closed at the end of the season in 2018, the workers assumed they would be back the following winter. Maps of the pistes were left stacked beside a stapler; the staff rota pinned to the wall. Six years on, a yellowing newspaper dated 8 March 2018 sits folded on its side, as if someone has just flicked through it during a quiet spell. A half-drunk bottle of water remains on the table. The Céüze resort in the southern French Alps had been open for 85 years and was one of the oldest in the country. Today, it is one of scores of ski resorts abandoned across France – part of a new landscape of “ , raising questions about how we leave mountains – among the last wild spaces in Europe As global heating pushes the snow line higher across the Alps, thousands of structures are being left to rot – some of them breaking down and contaminating the surrounding earth, driving debate about what should happen to the remnants of old ways of life – and whether to let nature reclaim the mountains. Snowfall at Céüze started becoming unreliable in the 1990s. To be financially viable, the resort needed to be open for at least three months. In that last winter, it only managed a month and a half. For the two years before that it had not been able to operate at all. Opening the resort each season cost the local authority as much as €450,000 (£390,000). As the season got shorter, the numbers no longer added up. To avoid a spiral of debt, the decision was made to close. “It was costing us more to keep it open than to keep it closed for the season,” says Michel Ricou-Charles, president of the local Buëch‑Dévoluy community council, which oversees the site. Even under the most optimistic projections, the future looked bleak. “We looked into using artificial snow, but realised that would delay the inevitable,” he says. It was seven years before the trucks and helicopters came in to begin removing the pylons. Still, the local community grieved for the small, family-oriented resort, which was host to generations of memories. As demolitions began, they came to take nuts, bolts and washers as mementoes of what they had lost. that have been abandoned, nearly three-quarters of them in protected areas. It is not just ski infrastructure. The Mountain Wilderness association estimates that there are more than 3,000 abandoned structures dotted around French mountains, slowly degrading Europe’s richest wild terrain. This includes military, industrial and forestry waste, such as old cables, bits of barbed wire, fencing and old machinery. Céüze ski resort is fast becoming one of these pollutants. The little wooden cabin at the bottom of the first button lift is shedding insulation. Ropes once used to mark out the piste hang in tatters and bits of plastic are falling off a pylon. The old sheds at each end of the ski lifts often still contain transformers, asbestos, motor oils and greases. Over time, these substances seep into the soil and water. Corrosion and rust from metal structures left over from the second world war, such as anti-tank rails and metal spikes, have led to changes in plant species in the surrounding area, potentially offering a vision of what could happen if pylons are left to rust over the coming decades. – remember that you are mortal. Don’t think that you are making eternal things; they will end up becoming obsolete,” says Nicolas Masson, from Mountain Wilderness, which is campaigning for old ski infrastructure to be dismantled to make space for nature. “When you make them, ask yourself the question: what will remain?” Some believe the resorts should remain memorialised landscapes, honouring generations of people who lived and skied here; others believe they should be returned to wild landscapes with their disintegrating machinery removed. Céüze’s deconstruction started on 4 November 2025, a month before the ski season would once have kicked off. The resort’s ski lifts were airlifted out using a helicopter to minimise environmental disturbance and compression of the earth. French law requires ski lifts to be removed and dismantled if they are no longer in use. The law , however. Most last for 30 years, so no lifts would be considered obsolete until at least 2047. The process is also expensive: dismantling Céüze will cost €123,000. This means most abandoned ski infrastructure is left to disintegrate in situ. What is happening in Céüze is rare. With pylons cleared and the resort already closed for seven years, early signs of ecological recovery are already visible. A red haze floats over the white snow: winter berries of the dog rose are sprouting where the piste is no longer mown. The berries are important winter food for birds such as the rare red-billed chough, and their thorny stems are used for nest-building come spring. In the summer, orchids and yellow gentians bloom over these hillsides. The hills surrounding the site are classed as , meaning they are home to Europe’s rarest and most protected wildlife. The trees are coming back too. “I don’t know if it would take 10, 20 or 50 years, but this is becoming a forest,” says Masson. Wild boar and roe deer living in these forests will benefit from quieter winters. Birds such as grouse shelter from severe cold in winter by digging into the snow, and prefer deep powdery snow – just like skiers. The species is endangered in all the mountain ranges of The dismantling of Céüze comes at a time when many spaces for nature are shrinking. Pierre-Alexandre Métral, a geographer at the University of Grenoble Alpes, who studies abandoned ski resorts, says: “There is a lot of debate about the nature of this dismantling – is it just removing mechanical stuff, or are we attempting to put mountains back into a kind of original state?” Ecological recovery can be filled with surprises, he says, noting that the maintenance of pistes can be beneficial to some alpine flowers. “If we let nature come back spontaneously – in a wild, uncontrolled way – there are also risks that some invasive species that tend to be stronger could colonise faster,” says Métral. There is scant research in this area, but studies from the in Madrid’s Sierra de Guadarrama in 1999 show it led to significant recovery of native vegetation and cleaner waterways, while reducing soil erosion. “These are laboratories of what the mountain could be like in the future with new closures,” says Métral. The question of what to do with these places will play out across Europe’s mountains, and around the world. Skiing is many alpine landscapes. “Many lower ones are already closed,” says Masson. “A fraction of a degree changes everything in the mountain environment. It’s the difference between having snow and no snow.” that with 2C (3.6F) of global heating, more than half of existing resorts risk having too little snow. Higher altitude resorts are vulnerable to the , threatening pylons that have been drilled into it. Some resorts, such as St-Honoré 1500, were . Even bigger resorts, which typically have funds to invest in new pistes and artificial snow, For some, the loss of Céüze feels premature. Richard Klein,who lives in Roche des Arnauds, near Céüze, feels the ski resort could – and should – have been saved. “It’s a wonderful place to learn to ski – it’s the best. I think it’s really stupid they closed it,” he says. “There were always loads of people.” Klein believes the local authority should have begun using artificial snow, adding: “Now it’s too late.” Yet life has not disappeared from Céüze. In October 2025, the resort’s Hotel Galliard is being sold to a developer looking to open it for events, according to Ricou-Charles. A property developer has bought the children’s holiday residence, and a carpenter has moved into the building where the old ticket office was. The rooms used as a holiday camp for children have cracks appearing down the side, but might open again in the future. “Céüze will continue to live, despite the loss of the resort,” says Ricou-Charles. “We are not mourning Céüze because it is not dead.” On winter weekends dozens of cars still gather in the car park, with people enjoying quieter activities on the hillside, such as walking, snow-shoeing, cross-country skiing and sledging. Masson does not like the term “ghost resort” because it suggests total abandonment when what is happening in his area is more complicated. “People continue to come,” he says. “We don’t need large machines to make mountains attractive.” What happens at Céüze is a glimpse into a future that faces dozens of other small resorts, and mountain landscapes, across . “What is our heritage that we will want to keep,” asks Masson. “And what is just a ruin we want to dismantle? That is a question we have to ask every time, and it requires some reflection.”",Phoebe Weston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/older-swedes-reap-benefits-late-life-education,‘Keeps your mind alert’: older Swedes reap the benefits of learning for pleasure,2025-12-26T05:00:06.000Z,"Retirees with ‘fantastic hunger for education’ taking part in university organised events in record numbers Record numbers of Swedish retirees are enrolling in a university run “by pensioners for pensioners” amid increased loneliness and a growing appetite for learning and in-person interactions. Senioruniversitet, a national university that collaborates with Sweden’s adult education institution Folkuniversitetet, has about 30 independent branches around the country which run study circles, lecture series and university courses in subjects including languages, politics, medicine and architecture. The Stockholm branch, which is Sweden’s largest, has become so popular since it was founded in 1991 that it is now run across multiple venues across the capital by about 100 volunteers. Its most popular event, the Tuesday lectures, gets about 1,000 people each week. Recent Stockholm lectures have included “The art of awarding Nobel prizes” by a former member of a Nobel committee, “Disinformation and AI – the threat we invented ourselves” and “From soap to cultural heritage/canon and vice versa.” Inga Sanner, chair of Senioruniversitetet in Stockholm, said membership nationally was at an all-time high. “We had a dip during the pandemic, of course, but we have come up again to the same number and increased even more. Our membership is the highest ever.” In 2023 there were 2,099 events held across Sweden attended by 161,932 participants, according to Folkuniversitetet. This year, that number is projected to increase to 177,024 participants across 2,391 events. Gunnar Danielsson, secretary general of Folkuniversitetet, said: “The desire to learn for pleasure’s sake, or for the sake of learning as such, is a joy to experience in a society which is increasingly obsessed with learning and education as preparation for work.” The increasing popularity of Senioruniversitetet was not reflected by the level of government funding, though, he said, which had “significantly decreased” over the past few years. “More likely it reflects a desire to actually meet other people in real life rather than on the internet.” Sanner, a retired history professor, said older people were “more and more alert” and that there is a “fantastic hunger for education”. She added: “It’s totally fascinating that there are so many who want to learn more and learn more about the world. It is so very needed in our time.” The wider societal role that Senioruniversitetet plays is becoming increasingly important, she said, and the learning and wellbeing of its members has a knock-on effect to their families and beyond. “It is to do with democracy issues and education. Senior citizens don’t live in a vacuum. If nothing else, it has an effect on children and grandchildren,” she said. “You are an example. Not just sitting rocking in a rocking chair, but you are out and want to learn more. Then you can share that with your grandchildren and children.” She added: “The lectures are fantastic. You become completely fulfilled when you have been to an event and then it bubbles over when you meet others.” For many of their volunteers, their office in central Stockholm is like a workplace. “It is very meaningful work, but also you have such a lovely time and meet others.” Sanner said the demographic of its membership does, however, tend to be “too homogenous”, adding that they need to do more to extend their reach to a more diverse audience. Susanne Abelin, 66, a former journalist from Norrtälje, near Stockholm, volunteers on the university’s newsletter and is learning Italian. Ageism is rife in Sweden, she said, and palpable in day-to-day life. “You are seen more or less as an idiot. Maybe it’s because we have had it so materially well over generations that we don’t need each other so much – for good and for bad.” But Senioruniversitetet, where over-55s can learn for a relatively low fee, is “a bit of the Swedish welfare system that is still left”. Her Italian class has a WhatsApp group so they can stay in touch outside lessons and last year she went to Italy with one of her classmates. “I’m absolutely not fluent in Italian and will never be, but it is inspiring and it keeps your mind alert. Instead of doing crosswords and suduko you can study some verbs.” Joachim Forsgren, 71, a former physician who now volunteers for the Stockholm branch, has given lectures on “man and drugs” and tuberculosis. Volunteering, he said, gives people a “sense of meaning and that they are contributing still”. He added: “People can get the feeling that they are not contributing once they leave their jobs. Pensioners is a word I hate.” By volunteering, he said, “we are contributing to some kind of democracy project. This is really trying, especially in this day and age, to get people interested in what is going on”. Amid the rise of online disinformation and populism, the university helps people to “look critically at the amount of information we are almost drowning in every day”.",Miranda Bryant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victoria police said the pair set out from Portarlington on the Bellarine peninsula about 3pm on Thursday but drifted out into the bay when conditions deteriorated and were swept all the way to Wyndham harbour in Melbourne’s outer west. They were among six people rescued in three separate potential drowning incidents in Victoria on the same day, police said. The two paddle boarders were a 51-year-old woman and her 17-year-old stepson, After their family raised the alarm just after 5pm, ground police officers, air wing police helicopter officers, Life Saving Victoria and Queenscliff coast guards went looking for them. Police said at about 6.20pm air wing officers spotted the pair, who were not wearing lifejackets, lying on their paddle boards and waving for assistance. Apart from being exhausted and cold they were not physically injured, police said. In a statement released through police, the pair said they wanted to express their sincere thanks to everyone who was involved in their rescue. “We are so grateful for the outcome but still trying to come to terms with how quickly a beautiful, carefree afternoon turned into an almost tragedy,” they said. “We are exhausted, very shaken and feel so lucky we were able to stay together. We commend the efforts of all the agencies involved. “The decisive and quick action led not only to our rescue, but our survival. Thank you so much.” In another Christmas Day incident, police said they were called to Lake King in Paynesville following reports a kayaker was in trouble about 1.30pm. Police said officers were told the man was seen struggling before his kayak rolled and had not been seen for about two hours. Water police, air wing and the coast guard searched for the Hoppers Crossing man, who was spotted by the police helicopter just before 3pm, picked up by the coast guard and returned unharmed to shore, police said. Police said they were also called out to Westernport Bay after a mother and her two teenage daughters got into difficulty while kayaking near the Corinella jetty about 2.10pm. The trio had attempted to retrieve an adrift kayak when the current and strong winds swept them a significant distance from shore, police said. They were all wearing lifejackets. The woman and girls had ended up about 1km from the shore line and police said local officers coordinated with the Westpac rescue helicopter to winch them to safety. They were dropped back to Corinella without injury, police said.",Catie McLeod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Residents who evacuated their homes ahead of an out-of-control bushfire near Boddington, 130km south-east of Perth, were able to return home on Saturday, Western Australian fire authorities said. The fire has burned through more than 4,000 hectares and caused significant damage to the Newmont Boddington goldmine. Many residents were forced to spend Christmas night in an evacuation centre. On Friday evening, 18 people were still at the evacuation centre. It was downgraded to a watch and act level on Saturday morning, with WA’s Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) announcing people could return home on Saturday morning. “Residents can return to Boddington, Ranford, and surrounding areas however, please prioritise safety and stay cautious of your surroundings,” DFES said. “The evacuation centre is now closed.” Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Jonathan How said a cool change would help to ease the fire danger but there were still eight fires burning. The milder conditions across the rest of the state will persist through Sunday but more heat is on its way, with large parts of WA expected to see temperatures remain above 30C. Meanwhile, large parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory are expecting monsoonal rain, with the possibility of thunderstorms and floods. “We have seen the monsoon trough develop across northern Australia and with that we are expecting very widespread monsoonal rain and storms,” How said. The flood watch currently sits over “a very large area”, from the Mackay coast up towards Townsville, and then inland all the way to the west and south-west of Queensland, through to the NT into Tennant Creek. North-west Queensland, particularly around the Gulf Coast, is expected to be hit with between 300 to 500 millimetres of rain – enough to cut off roads, isolate communities and halt travel. A flood warning has also been issued for areas between Townsville and Cairns, with forecast rainfall of 50 to 100 millimetres, increasing to 150 millimetres early next week. Most of the rest of the country is expected to have warm weather for the next few days, with temperatures in the mid to high 30s for Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra.

The mistaken release of the body by the hospital to the undertakers was only discovered after the funeral service and the cremation had taken place. The error also meant another family were prevented from having their relative’s remains at their funeral. NHS bosses have apologised to the two families affected by the mistake at Queen Elizabeth university hospital in Glasgow, the largest hospital in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which runs the hospital, said the incident was a result of human error after admitting that procedures for identifying and labelling bodies before transfer from the mortuary had not been followed. A full investigation has been launched into the incident, reported to have taken place last month. Meanwhile, the staff involved have been suspended. Dr Scott Davidson, medical director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, offered “sincere apologies” to both families. “We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker,” he said. “It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time. “We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied.” Queen Elizabeth university hospital is subject to a public inquiry after a series of infection outbreaks and concerns about water and ventilation systems emerged just three years after it was built in 2015.

The electoral council proclaimed a winner before completing the review of all tally sheets under a “special scrutiny” launched last week earlier to recount votes flagged as “inconsistent”. The decision was criticised by defeated candidates and , which sent an observation mission to the election held on 30 November but whose vote count Asfura has already declared himself president-elect. “Honduras, we now have the official declaration from the CNE [electoral council]. I recognise the great work carried out by the councillors and the entire team that ran the election. Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down. God bless Honduras,” he alleging fraud in the counting process, including “forgery of public documents”, claiming that “the data from the original tally sheets were altered”. Nasralla urged his supporters to remain calm and refrain from any acts of disruption or violence, adding this was “the saddest Christmas for the Honduran people.” The head of the Honduran Congress also rejected the results. “This is completely outside the law. It has no value,” Congress president Luis Redondo, of the ruling Libre party, wrote on X. The electoral council is made up of three councillors: one aligned with Asfura’s party, one with Nasralla’s, and one with the party of the leftist president, Xiomara Castro, whose candidate finished third. Asfura’s victory was declared only by the first two councillors. The representative linked to the president’s party refused to recognise the result, alleged that an “electoral coup” was under way and filed a complaint with the public prosecutor’s office, raising the prospect that the outcome will be challenged in court. In its statement, the council said: “By the majority will of the Honduran people, expressed sovereignly at the ballot box, the full council of the CNE declares Nasry Juan Asfura Zablah constitutional president of the Republic of for the four-year term beginning on 27 January 2026 and ending on 27 January 2030.” The declaration before the end of the recount was the latest in a string of controversies that marked the Central American country’s presidential race, starting with what many saw as open interference by the US president. Days before the vote, Trump publicly backed Asfura, said the US would support the next government only if he won, and attacked the other leading candidates, calling them communists or allies of Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro. On the eve of the election, the US president also for the former Honduran president and Asfura ally Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/26/trump-supporters-nigeria-airstrikes,Trump supporters hail US strikes in Nigeria as ‘amazing Christmas present’,2025-12-26T17:50:21.000Z,"Some even celebrated ‘mass killing’ and the president’s ‘resolve’ in attacking Islamic State targets have been met with praise by supporters who for months had been agitating for the president to respond forcefully to the killings of Christians in the country. “I can’t think of a better way to celebrate Christmas than by avenging the death of Christians through the justified mass killing of Islamic terrorists,” the far-right political activist Laura Loomer posted on X. “You’ve got to love it! Death to all Islamic terrorists! Thank you.” Loomer said she had been informed by the US defense department – which the calls the war department – that the American cruise missile strikes carried out with the Nigerian government’s cooperation had been “a direct response to [IS] jihadi terrorists killing Christians in Nigeria”. The US House member Randy Fine, a Florida Republican who in November supported a congressional calling for Nigeria to be designated a “country of particular concern” due to its religious violence, described Thursday’s strikes as an “amazing Christmas present!” “With Muslim terrorists attacking Christians in Nigeria, Syria, and even Europe – simply for refusing to submit to Islam – the president is showing that we will no longer tolerate these barbarians,” , after suggesting earlier in December that “mainstream Muslims” should be “destroyed”. The uniformity of the Republicans’ response comes in contrast to a campaign involving economic pressure as well as airstrikes on alleged drug boats that the Trump administration is waging on Venezuela to oust its president, Nicolás Maduro. Some have warned that the history of US “regime change” efforts are not promising and have warned against direct military strikes on Venezuela. Attacks on Christians by Islamic extremist groups in such as Boko Haram had been drawing increased attention from US Christian groups that are generally aligned with Trump. “Do not test President Trump‘s resolved [sic] in this matter,” said from the Republican US House member Riley Moore of West Virginia, who introduced the Nigeria-related congressional resolution in November. “Tonight’s strike in coordination with the Nigerian government is just the first step to ending the slaughter of Christians and the security crisis affecting all Nigerians.” In further comments on Friday, other Republican lawmakers praised Trump for carrying out the strikes. North Carolina senator Ted Budd, a Republican, that IS “is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Christians & religious minorities in Nigeria”. Budd wrote that Trump’s “decisive strikes will save lives & protect religious freedom. May God bless our brave men & women in uniform.” Congressman Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who recently led a delegation to Nigeria, said that attitudes within the Nigerian government were “beginning to turn in favor of protecting Christians – in addition to taking actions against those terrorizing Christians and moderate Muslims”. Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, that he commended the Trump administration as well as American troops for “these strikes against bloodthirsty [IS] savages who are not only persecuting Christians, but also have killed many Americans”. Pressure on the administration to act in Nigeria had been building since July, when the US Commission on International Religious Freedom issued an that said the Nigerian government was “often unable to prevent or slow to react to violent attacks by Fulani herders, bandit gangs, and insurgent entities such as JAS/Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)”. In October, Ted Cruz – a Republican senator from Texas – said the US was able to identify the perpetrators of anti-Christian violence in Nigeria “and I intend to hold them accountable”. Cruz said that since 2009, “over 50,000 Christians in Nigeria have been massacred, and over 18,000 churches and 2,000 Christian schools have been destroyed”. At the recent AmericaFest, a four-day gathering of US conservative organized by Turning Point USA, the Trinidadian rap star spoke with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, on the oppression of Christians in Nigeria. She said she loved Nigeria in part because her pastor is Nigerian. “Hearing that people are being kidnapped – while they’re in church, people are being kidnapped, people are being killed, brutalized, all because of their religion – that should spark outrage in America, and that’s what it’s doing,” Minaj said. on Friday that the Christmas strike was originally to take place on Wednesday, but the president had the operation delayed until Thursday for symbolic reasons. “I said, ‘Nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” Trump remarked to the outlet. “They didn’t think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.” Thursday’s strikes in Nigeria come less than a week after the US hit more than 70 Islamic State networks and infrastructure in Syria in response to an attack that killed two American military service members as well as a civilian. Adm Brad Cooper, commander of the American military’s Central Command (Centcom), said the Syrian strikes were “critical to preventing [IS] from inspiring terrorist plots and attacks against the US homeland”.

What we know on day 1,403 In the message, published by the state-run KCNA news agency, Kim said 2025 was a “really meaningful year” for the bilateral alliance that was consolidated by “sharing blood, life and death in the same trench”. North Korea confirmed in April that it had deployed troops to support Russia’s military campaign against Ukraine and that its . Earlier this month, Pyongyang acknowledged that it had sent troops to clear mines in Russia’s Kursk region in August 2025. “Explosions in the capital. Air defence forces are operating. Stay in shelters!” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote on Telegram. Ukraine’s air force also announced a countrywide air alert in the early hours of Saturday and said on social media that drones and missiles were moving over several Ukrainian regions, including the capital. Agence France-Presse journalists in Kyiv heard several loud explosions, some accompanied by bright flashes that lit the horizon orange. A military Telegram channel said cruise and ballistic missiles were being deployed in the city. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said on Russian television. “Especially in a context where Kyiv and its sponsors – notably within the European Union, who are not in favour of an agreement – have stepped up efforts to torpedo it.” Ryabkov added: “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord.” He said any deal had to “remain within the limits” fixed by Trump and Putin when they met in Alaska in August, or else “no accord can be reached”. “We note that the Russians are trying to bypass our defensive interceptor positions through the territory of neighbouring Belarus,” the Ukrainian president wrote on Telegram. He said Ukrainian intelligence had observed that Belarus was deploying equipment to carry out its attacks “in Belarusian settlements near the border, including on residential buildings”. “Antennae and other equipment are located on the roofs of ordinary five-storey apartment buildings, which help guide Shaheds [drones] to targets in our western regions. This is an absolute disregard for human lives.” Jeffrey Lewis and Decker Eveleth said they based their finding on imagery from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, that showed features consistent with a Russian strategic missile base. Lewis and Eveleth said they were 90% certain that mobile Oreshnik launchers would be stationed at the former airbase near Krichev, 307km east of the Belarus capital, Minsk. The researchers said reviews of the Planet Labs imagery revealed a hurried construction project that began between 4 and 12 August and showed features consistent with those of a Russian strategic missile base. One “dead giveaway” in a 19 November photo is a “military-grade rail transfer point” enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train, said Eveleth. The ministry wrote on Telegram it had seized the village of Kosivtseve, north of the town of Huliaipole, which has come under severe Russian pressure in recent weeks. It said Russian troops had taken more than 23 sq km of territory in securing the village, giving the “east” group of forces “a base for further offensive actions”. The defence ministry said its forces had deployed drones to prevent fresh Ukrainian troops from entering Huliaipole.",The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/27/grannies-catalan-chefs-preserving-traditional-cuisine,"No gels, no foams: Catalonia turns to grannies to teach traditional cooking",2025-12-27T07:00:32.000Z,"Region famed for molecular gastronomy begins video project to collect and share rustic recipes atalonia’s avant garde chefs have made a name for themselves with their revolutionary techniques and molecular gastronomy, yet they are fond of saying they are merely paying homage to the simple dishes served at their grandmother’s table. Maybe so, but now the grannies have been given a chance to show off the real thing under a Catalan government initiative called Gastrosàvies. A double play on the Catalan words for wise and grandmother, Gastrosàvies provides a platform for more than 100 women of a certain age to share videos cooking traditional dishes “with a view to preserving and communicating traditional Catalan cuisine for future generations”. No spherification and liquid nitrogen for these chefs – just some basic ingredients, a sharp knife and a couple of pots and pans. The project has collected more than 300 recipes from all over Catalonia, and videos of home cooks preparing 12 of them These simple creations such as rice with cabbage and peas, thyme soup, chicken with apple, duck with turnips or pork chops with chestnuts hark back to an era where people cooked with what was at hand and in season, using basic equipment and techniques handed down over generations. While these rustic dishes can still be found in bars and restaurants in rural Catalonia, they are increasingly hard to come by in Barcelona where they have been usurped by pizza, kebabs, ramen, sushi and the ubiquitous Argentinian empanadas. Working in her farm house kitchen in the village of Santa Margarida i els Monjos in Penedès, a region 45 minutes south of Barcelona, Maria Antònia Udina, 76, prepares a Penedès cockerel with dried fruit and nuts and a dash of cognac, a dish characteristic of Catalan cuisine. “Catalonia is small but we have mountains and sea and we like mixing the two,” she says. “That’s why we cook meat with fruit or meat with fish in dishes such as meatballs with cuttlefish, chicken with prawns or xató, a salad made with frisee, salt cod, tuna and romesco sauce.” Udina’s mother cooked for her and her five siblings, “simple dishes with local products, a lot of potatoes, a lot of rice. We did the dishes and laid the table but my mother did the cooking. I didn’t really know how to cook. I wasn’t a good eater as a child but I loved mashed potatoes with a bit of oil poured over them.” She is also a champion of local produce such as the Penedès cockerel that she and her husband farmed until a few years ago. She says the Penedès variety has more flavour and a better texture than supermarket chicken because it’s reared for twice as long and is fed on grape seeds from local vineyards. She lists what in her view are Catalan cuisine’s three essential characteristics: the sofregit made with olive oil, onions, tomatoes and sometimes peppers or carrots, which is the ground zero of dozens of dishes; the use of herbs such as rosemary, bay and thyme, and finally the picada, a paste made from olive oil, ground almonds or hazelnuts, garlic, parsley and fried bread, served as an accompaniment to many dishes and a key ingredient in suquet de peix, the Catalan version of bouillabaisse. Although Udina has a reputation as an excellent cook, she has never worked as a professional chef. However, she has dined in some of the region’s most famous restaurants, among them Can Fabes, the first in Catalonia to be awarded three Michelin stars, and El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world. She admires these avant garde chefs and accepts that their cuisine is rooted in tradition. However, she is sceptical about the claim that it’s simply a homage to their mother’s and grandmother’s tables. For example, Udina says, wild mushrooms are a staple of Catalan cooking but at Can Fabes, “we had six or seven dishes that were all made with wild mushrooms, including an ice-cream”. “That’s nothing like what their mothers would have cooked,” she says, adding that she believes there’s a move back towards simpler, less innovative cuisine and hopes that Gastrosàvies will encourage “our children and grandchildren to cook traditional food instead of pizza, hamburgers and Pot Noodles”.",Stephen Burgen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As much as 12in of rain fell across the area on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, triggering flooding and washing out roads. Local authorities issued an evacuation warning for Wrightwood, California, a town of just under 5,000 people around 80 miles (130km) north-east of Los Angeles, as images showed mud and debris engulfing homes and vehicles. The San Bernardino county fire department that one person was injured in the slide, but that weather conditions were expected to improve and there was no ongoing safety threat. The town remained under an evacuation warning on Friday morning with some surrounding roads closed, according to the county’s emergency service system. There was still a risk of more flash flooding and mudslides on Friday around Los Angeles, the National Weather Service warned, even as the rain began to ease up. “Still not quite out of the woods, but for the most part, the worst is over,” said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Los Angeles. Firefighters rescued more than 100 people Thursday in Los Angeles county, with one helicopter pulling 21 people from stranded cars, officials said. LA police also responded to more than 350 traffic collisions, the mayor’s office said. The storms, a result of atmospheric rivers carrying plumes of moisture from the tropics, hit during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The immense rainfall was also a stark shift from last winter, when created conditions for the rapid spread of devastating wildfires across the region. The system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said. since the storms began earlier this week. A motorist was killed in the northern California city of Redding during a flood. Farther south, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy in what appeared to be a weather-related crash. And in San Diego, a man In Wrightwood, the storm knocked out power and left a gas station and coffee shop that ran on generators to serve as a hub for residents and visitors. “It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo. Lopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard, but they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and an e-bike. “We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said. Davey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (2.4km) through rain and flood water up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence on Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house. “I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said on Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all OK – just a little bit scared.” Arlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged. “It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.” With more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said Shawn Millerick, San Bernardino county fire department spokesperson. “We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.” Areas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3-2.5cm) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8in, with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. More wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous. Elsewhere across the US, millions of additional residents were bracing for extreme weather. Forecasters said that a weekend storm could bring New York City’s biggest snowfall in three years. Freezing rain was falling Friday in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in New York, an emergency was declared for much of the state before widespread snowfall expected on Friday night into Saturday morning. In Connecticut, people were encouraged to avoid travel as a winter storm approached the north-east on Friday. This article was amended on 26 December 2025.

After initially announcing plans to implement the scheme earlier this year, the government has now confirmed that about 150 under-25s will be recruited for the pilot programme, which is due to start in March 2026. These will be paid, two-year placements, although it has not been revealed how much each participant will be paid. After the scheme’s launch, the government plans to expand it to more than 1,000 per year, according to the i paper. It would not involve deployment to active operations, and there would be no obligation to stay in the military after completing the scheme, as it aims to teach transferable skills that can be used in other industries. John Healey, the defence secretary, told the i paper that the scheme would “give Britain’s young people a taste of the incredible skills and training on offer across the army, Royal Navy and RAF”. He added: “As families come together at this time of year, and young people think about their futures, I want the outstanding opportunities on offer in our armed forces to be part of that conversation in homes across the UK.” Under the current plans, the army scheme involves 13 weeks of basic training as part of a two-year placement, while the navy scheme would last one year and provide “profession agnostic” training for sailors, according to reports. The RAF’s scheme is less developed, although options are reportedly being explored. It comes after the chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Rich Knighton, said Britain’s “sons and daughters” should be “ready to fight” and called for a “whole of society” effort to defend the country in the face of Russian aggression. The British army already runs an internship scheme, formerly known as gap year commissions, but it had a low uptake in 2024/25 , with only 10 people enrolling.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/cape-froward-new-national-park-patagonia-chile,"‘It’s the wildest place I have walked’: new national park will join up Chile’s 2,800km wildlife corridor",2025-12-25T12:00:42.000Z,"Government poised to officially protect 200,000 hectares of remote Patagonian coastline and forest Chile’s government is poised to create the country’s 47th national park, protecting nearly 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) of pristine wilderness and completing a stretching 1,700 miles (2,800km) to the southernmost tip of the Americas. The Cape Froward national park is a wild expanse of wind-torn coastline and forested valleys that harbours unrivalled biodiversity and has played host to millennia of human history. “I have been to many exceptional places, and I can tell you that the Cape Froward project is the wildest place I have walked through,” said Kristine Tompkins, the renowned US conservationist at the heart of the project. “It’s one of the few truly wild forest and peak territories left in the country, and the richness of the Indigenous history in the region makes a case for these territories to be preserved for all time.” It is the 17th national park created or expanded in Chile and Argentina by Tompkins Conservation and its successor organisation, Rewilding Chile. The groups have spent the best part of a decade knitting together a In 2023, they signed an agreement with the Chilean government to donate the land to become Cape Froward national park. In February, a population of 10 huemul, an endangered deer species, was found in the park, and a network of cameras regularly captures wild pumas and the endangered huillín, a river otter. The area also encompasses 10,000 hectares of sphagnum bogs, a spongelike moss which stores carbon deep below the ground. Benjamín Cáceres, the conservation coordinator in the Magallanes region for Chile, is a native of Patagonia who first visited Cape Froward at the age of 12 with his conservationist father, Patricio Cáceres. “My father was always a dreamer,” he said. “When he found out about an abandoned lighthouse all those years ago, he brought us here as a family to dream with him – and that’s where this story began for me.” The San Isidro lighthouse is one of seven designed and built by the Scottish architect George Slight along the treacherous strait of Magellan. It was abandoned in the 1970s and itinerant fishers would come by to salvage wood until the roof collapsed. Now, Patricio and Benjamín’s vision for the restored lighthouse is becoming a reality. It has been converted into a museum of the natural and human history of the area and – together with a cafe on the beach below – will become the entry point for the new national park. Dotted along the shoreline are delicate archaeological sites that enshrine the history of the Kawésqar, a nomadic Indigenous people who navigated fjords, rocky beaches and forests in canoes carved from trees. “This mosaic of ecosystems is tremendously important,” said Cáceres. “The bogs and subantarctic forests are incredibly fragile, and the cultural legacy of the Kawésqar territory, the era of explorers, then whalers; all of this history and biodiversity will be preserved in some form in the future national park.” In among shells buried in silty mud at Kawésqar campsites are bird and dolphin bones from feasts. There are even circles of stones set out as fish traps on the beaches, and trees stripped of their bark to line the hulls of Kawésqar canoes. “The area was widely inhabited by nomadic canoeists who lived by fishing and gathering food,” said Leticia Caro, a Kawésqar activist who belongs to the Nómades del Mar community. “For our community, it is very important to protect this area, where you can also see the different ways of inhabiting the land and seas, and the interaction with other peoples like the Long after Indigenous communities had settled in the area, the waters of the strait of Magellan, which the Kawésqar call the , became the link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Charles Darwin stepped off the Beagle to climb nearby Mount Tarn on his voyage along the coast of Chile and the strait was one of the world’s most important shipping routes until the Panama canal opened in 1914. The murky depths have claimed many lives and spawned legends. Treasure troves lie in the depths, and sealed bottles of rum have washed ashore over the centuries. Timber from the forests has been taken as far afield as the Falkland Islands and Buenos Aires for construction and, in 1905, the Magallanes Whaling Society was formed. Eleven years later, with the whale population decimated, an auction was held to sell off the society’s land and equipment. All that is left at Bahía el Águila, where the carcasses were processed, is the footprint of the factory and a few rotting wooden stumps. Adolf Andresen, the society’s Norwegian founder, died poor and forgotten in the saloon bars of Punta Arenas in 1940. But there are still a number of steps before the national park officially comes into existence. An Indigenous consultation process, a legal requirement for large-scale projects in Chile, was held in September but fell flat. Chile’s environment ministry said it would make “every effort” to advance with plans for the park by March. But if no progress is made after two years, the lands revert to the ownership of Tompkins’ organisations. “Each of the park projects we have developed has specific reasons for being considered essential for conservation,” said Tompkins, who was the chief executive of Patagonia outdoor clothing for 20 years until 1993. “And in this sense Cape Froward is a piece of an ecological puzzle that, over time, should ensure that key biodiversity sites within Chilean Patagonia are permanently protected.”",John Bartlett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intense overnight strikes lasted 10 hours and killed one person and wounded two dozen others. They came as for a face-to-face meeting on Sunday with Donald Trump, who has proposed a plan to end nearly four years of fighting that has killed tens of thousands. Zelensky said he was en route to the US and would stop in Canada, where he and the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, would speak by video call with European allies later on Saturday. European and Canadian politicians and diplomats have sought to help Zelenskyy deal with Trump during negotiations. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will take part in the call with Zelenskyy , a commission spokesperson said. Key sticking points include and reconstruction, plus territorial discussions regarding the Donbas region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskyy said the overnight bombings showed international pressure on Russia was insufficient. “If Russia turns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burned apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,” he said. “The United States has this capability. Europe has this capability. Many of our partners have this capability. The key is to use it.” meeting with Trump in Florida is “specifically intended to refine things as much as we possibly can”. Speaking on Friday, he added that a proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”. “Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.” Zelenskyy has reportedly said he would need to seek approval of the Ukrainian public if he failed to secure a “strong” position on territory. After the strikes on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s “only response to peace efforts” was “brutal attacks using hundreds of drones and missiles against Kyiv and other cities and regions”. The minister said that a third of the capital was without heating. The temperature in Kyiv was about 0C (32F). The Russian strikes forced Polish fighter jets to scramble, and two airports in south-eastern Poland – Rzeszów and Lublin – were temporarily closed. last weekend in Miami, where Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met separately with Russian and Ukrainian representatives, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin’s demands. Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato’s article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms. on Friday, Trump said he anticipated a “good” meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy’s plan. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told the news website. “So we’ll see what he’s got.” The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, used a Russian television appearance on Friday to criticise Zelenskyy and European allies on their work on the peace plan. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said. He said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord,” Ryabkov added.",Oliver Holmes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/20/who-traditional-medicine-alternative-remedies-mainstream-healthcare-evidence,‘A potential treasure trove’: World Health Organization to explore benefits of traditional medicines,2025-12-20T13:00:31.000Z,"UN body to study possibility of integrating centuries-old practices into mainstream healthcare rom herbalists in Africa gathering plants to use as poultices to acupuncturists in China using needles to cure migraines, or Indian yogis practising meditation, traditional remedies have increasingly being shown to work, and deserve more attention and research, according to a A historical lack of evidence, which has seen traditional practices dismissed by many, could change with more investment and the use of modern technology, according to Dr Shyama Kuruvilla, who leads the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre. Earlier this year, countries agreed the WHO should adopt a for the next decade that “seeks to harness the potential contribution of TCIM [traditional, complementary and integrative medicine] to health and wellbeing based on evidence”. It includes plans to establish a robust evidence base for traditional medicine practices, develop regulation of treatments and practitioners and, where appropriate, integrate the practices into mainstream biomedical healthcare. “It’s super-exciting,” says Kuruvilla. “I’m not saying we know what works and what doesn’t work at scale – but I think there’s this opportunity [to find out] right now.” Traditional medicine, defined as systems for health and wellbeing that predate “biomedicine”, comes in many guises ranging from herbal tea to India’s Ayurvedic medical system. Many of these centuries-old practices have “huge potential”, says Kuruvilla, and can now be explored in new ways by technologies including artificial intelligence, genomics and brain scans. Kuruvilla says Thailand is a good example of a country embracing traditional medicine, with researchers observing and documenting traditional practice, and performing randomised trials to get herbal treatments on to the country’s essential medicines list. In May, Thailand’s health ministry recommended doctors for certain conditions including muscle pain and constipation. There have been some concerns that the WHO strategy could create a backdoor for unscientific systems such as homeopathy to enter the mainstream but Kuruvilla points out that homeopathy does not fit the WHO’s definition of traditional medicine – it was only created in the late 18th century – and that there is not strong enough evidence for the practice. But, she says: “With all of these – with biomedicine, homeopathy, traditional medicine – if the evidence changes, I think it’s our responsibility to be open to that.” In some countries homeopathy is used as a complementary medicine “and that’s up to the countries”, Kuruvilla says. “We have to, as WHO, just stick to the evidence. “So I think that’s our bottom line: is this supported by robust reliable evidence, especially on safety and efficacy? And if it’s not, WHO is not supporting it, whether it is biomedicine or traditional medicine.” suggest that in most countries, the majority of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine services are not part of the formal health system and are paid for by patients. They are less likely to be subject to official quality checks but are hugely popular. “Not engaging wasn’t an option, because that would mean everything goes on without any safeguards,” Kuruvilla says, pointing to a burgeoning trillion-dollar wellness industry ranging from yoga studios to “ New methods let scientists study traditional medicine “in a way that wasn’t possible before”, Kuruvilla says. Genomics might prompt new understanding of the properties of a plant, while modern scanning equipment can pick up changes in the brains of people meditating. “Meditation was all this ‘woo-woo stuff’ but now, seeing all these advances in neuroscience and showing changes in brain waves from functional magnetic resonance imaging, which we couldn’t do before – actually being able to trace the pathways that lead to changes in health measurements – I think this is really, really exciting,” she says. A new WHO strategic technical advisory group for traditional medicine was launched this week at a global summit in India. “This is a pivotal moment for traditional medicine. It embodies cultural heritage and national health identities, and increasingly, it constitutes a vital component of primary health care strategies,” Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO’s assistant director-general for health system, access and data, told the summit. The idea, Kuruvilla suggests, is to “build a bridge” between traditional medicine and biomedicine. It is important to “find commonalities”, she says. “Showing that the science can be robust is really, really important, and especially on the patient safety aspect.” Traditional medicine has the potential to be a “treasure trove”, Kuruvilla says. The vast numbers of people working in the field – including university-educated professionals accredited to work in clinics in China and India – could ease global workforce shortages and make a “huge contribution” to universal health coverage, she says. In the context of aid cuts forcing countries to rethink health provision, traditional medicine could be “a way for countries also to be more self-reliant and then share those resources with each other”. The risk of failing to invest, she says, is leaving people unable to access their preferred type of healthcare in a safe way and “the world not being able to use our shared heritage here in a way that allows us to find new holistic solutions for health and wellbeing of people and planet”.",Kat Lay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/27/trump-republicans-midterm-elections-approval-rating,"Dragged down by an unpopular president, Republicans are bracing for a midterm trouncing",2025-12-27T06:00:34.000Z,"As Americans tire of Donald Trump, a Democratic midterm ‘tsunami’ could sweep the GOP out of power It was a wake-up call for America. In January, “saved by God to make America great again” and issued a barrage of executive orders. In the ensuing months the US president and his allies moved at breakneck speed and seemed indomitable. But as 2025 draws to a close with Trump at meetings, the prevailing image is of a driver asleep at the wheel. Opinion polls suggest that Americans are turning against him. are heading for the exit ahead of congressional contests next November that look bleak for the president’s party. “He came into office and, like a blitzkrieg, was violating laws and the constitution,” said , director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. “The American political process is slow-moving and so he was able to do things that were extraordinary “But this is a guy whose legacy may well be the political collapse of in this era. Put another way, rather than asking who is going to be the inheritor of the Trump mantle and the so-called Maga movement, we may be talking in a year or so about which candidates can escape the odious distinction of having been connected with Trump.” Emboldened by his political comeback in the 2024 election, Trump hit the ground running. On his first day in office he involved in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and launched a radical expansion of executive power, a systematic retribution campaign against perceived adversaries, and a sweeping overhaul of domestic and foreign policy. A government-wide restructuring under the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) was led by the billionaire Elon Musk and resulted in mass federal layoffs and the dismantling of agencies such as USAID. But Trump and Musk fell out and Doge burned itself out. The president’s domestic agenda included a hardline immigration crackdown featuring mass deportations and the deployment of the national guard and other federal forces to US cities, often against the wishes of local authorities. was invoked to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador. , a political scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “He promised to secure the border but the deportations have gone too far. City after city, community after community has expressed frustration and dismay at the tactics.” Trump had also promised to fix the economy but his signature legislation, the “one big, beautiful bill” – rebranded as the – will, critics say, transfer wealth from the poor to the rich and strips healthcare from millions of people. Meanwhile the president’s disruptive policy centred on aggressive tariffs that caused market volatility and fuelled higher prices for consumers. Schiller added: “The greatest self-inflicted wound that the president has brought on himself and the Republicans are the tariffs. In the first administration, they were primarily directed at China and you can make an argument about that. “In this administration they are so much broader and more sweeping and it’s showing in supply chains, in consumer purchasing, in pricing, in every corner of people’s lives. Whether it’s a supermarket or it’s holiday gifting or whatever it is, they’re feeling it.” Trump’s appointment of Robert F Kennedy Jr helped fan anti-vaccine sentiment, leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases and a politicisation of the . He withdrew the US from the Paris agreement and systematically dismantled climate science infrastructure. At his political zenith, Trump’s embrace of authoritarianism appeared unstoppable. He quickly fired 17 independent inspectors general in apparent violation of federal law. He ordered the justice department to investigate perceived enemies including James Comey, the former director of the FBI, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general. The administration targeted law firms that represented adversaries, stripping contracts and security clearances to extract multimillion-dollar settlements. Billions in federal funding including Harvard and Columbia, leveraging antisemitism and DEI policies to force changes in curricula and leadership. Trump also pursued an aggressive campaign against mainstream media, suing news organisations such as , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, pushing the Federal Communications Commission to revoke broadcast licences and restricting access for some outlets while promoting “Maga media”. In 11 months he signed 225 executive orders, 56 memorandums and 114 proclamations. Many mirror proposals from the conservative policy document and have been met with significant legal challenges, with numerous actions deemed illegal and unconstitutional by federal judges. Skye Perryman, president and chief executive of , a national-legal organisation that has filed numerous lawsuits against the administration, said: This administration has been ruthlessly breaking the law, disregarding the protections that are provided through American law for people and communities. It has been governing in a way that is on a collision course with the constitution.” She gave examples including infringement of free speech, disregard for due process, an effort to replace civil servants with political loyalists, and a federal funding freeze that threatened food and nutritional assistance for 42 million Americans. But Perryman also finds hope in the way that people have responded. The American people have been pushing back. There have been nearly 500 lawsuits filed in federal court over the course of these first 11 months of the administration. The administration is losing in court before judges that were appointed by Republicans, One of the most unexpected developments of Trump’s second term is how much political time and capital he has invested in foreign policy. His relationships in the Middle East and cryptocurrency ventures prompted ethical concerns. His intention to for use as Air Force One drew rare bipartisan criticism as a “bribe”. Trump brokered a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas but gave the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while rolling out a red carpet for Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska. He ordered military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, leading to allegations of potential war crimes. , a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: “The focus on foreign affairs has surprised me. It’s not just the ongoing question of Ukraine. This has been a first year that has been much more defined by what he’s doing overseas than what he’s doing at home and I did not expect that. “I also expected more of what we saw during the campaign, which was a Trump that didn’t use social media in an explosive way on a regular basis, and instead we’ve returned significantly to the first term, where the language and the surprising use of social media is a defining feature of his presidency. People didn’t like it in term one and then they seem not to like it in term two. For months Trump appeared unassailable as the opposition Democratic party struggled to find its feet and protests appeared muted compared with his first term. staged in June to coincide with Trump’s 79th birthday and a rare military parade in Washington attracted 5 million people. This was followed by another No Kings protest in October, where the turnout of 7 million was said to be the biggest civic action in the US for more than half a century. Democrats also appeared to regain their mojo. Against the backdrop of the longest government shutdown in history, the party stormed to victory after victory in elections for governor of New Jersey and , mayor of New York, and other offices. The central theme of their campaign was affordability as millions of Americans struggle to make ends meet. Like Joe Biden before them, Republicans’ insistence that the economy is strong does not tally with many people’s daily experience at the supermarket. The president’s efforts to dismiss affordability as a “con job”, “hoax” and “scam” by the Democrats have rung hollow as he plans a $400m ballroom at the White House. With the Jeffrey Epstein files also casting a long shadow, Trump appears increasingly out of touch. For years he travelled the country drawing big crowds to rollicking campaign rallies where he would meet local officials. This year he has held only seven rallies, focusing his travel instead on overseas trips and his own luxury golf courses. The Atlantic magazine described him as “ showed Trump’s job approval rating down to 36%, the lowest of his second term, while disapproval had risen to 60% (his all-time low was , at the end of his first term after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol). Notably his approval rating was underwater on crime (43%), foreign affairs (41%), foreign trade (39%) and immigration (37%). The polls suggest that groups who moved towards Trump in 2024 – including young voters and Latino voters – are now deserting him and returning to the Democratic fold, animated by jobs, inflation and healthcare. Schiller of Brown University said: “This is getting into territory that is Biden numbers and the question is why. The president and his team have taken the signals from the voters on particular issues – for example, immigration and bringing manufacturing home where voters said, yes, we want a change in our policies – but they took it to the extreme. They overreached. “America, at the end of the day, is not an extremist country. If you go too far left, voters are unhappy; if you go too far right, voters are unhappy. This has been true for quite some time so what we’re seeing is voters expressing a sense of frustration, trying to send a signal, at least to the Republican party if not to the president: we’re not happy with the direction you’re taking us The omens for November 2026 are grim. History shows the party that holds the White House always tends to suffer losses in midterm elections. Democrats appear galvanised and determined to curb Trump’s power. Some Republicans are already deserting what they may fear is a sinking ship. Several Republican senators have announced they will not run for re-election next year: Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, , Joni Ernst of Iowa and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. Meanwhile, more than two dozen Republicans in the House of Representatives have announced they will not try to retain their seat. , a former assistant to Barack Obama and director of the White House office of political affairs, said: “Trump has run out of runway on Joe Biden. For the first few months of the presidency, he was given this allowance to blame everything that people are experiencing on Joe Biden. “But now, by a margin of two to one, voters hold Trump rather than Biden responsible for the outcomes in the economy and that’s got to be pretty scary for [House speaker] Mike Johnson and company.” Gaspard, now a distinguished senior fellow at the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington, added: “I would place the odds at 70% that Democrats are going to recapture the House in a massive tsunami. Republicans are losing every moment they’re talking about something other than the economy and forces them to talk about anything but the economy.” The midterms typically fire the starting gun for the next presidential election, consigning the incumbent to lame duck status. It is not a position that Trump – who continues to drop dark hints about running for an unconstitutional third term – is likely to relish. , a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “With Donald Trump, ‘lame duck’ may just be another word for nothing left to lose. He will still have vast, unchecked powers, which he’s already made clear that he will exercise in the rawest, most reckless way possible. “He’s figured out what he can do with the power of pardoning – for my friends everything, for my enemies the law. He’s pardoning major drug kingpins and corrupt politicians right and left before he’s officially a lame duck. How does Donald Trump behave when he has nothing politically left to lose? That’s a question I’m not sure that we’ve gotten our heads around.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Thomas Massie then successfully sought donations for his run for another term in the 2026 midterm elections against an opponent that Trump – his fellow Republican – has already endorsed. The back-and-forth illustrated a deepening divide between Trump and Massie. Massie earned the president’s disdain by working to pass a bipartisan congressional bill demanding the full release of documents pertaining to , the former friend of Trump who once pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor and then evidently died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on child sex-trafficking charges. on his Truth Social platform that dismissed Congress’s interest in Epstein as a “scam” while referring to Massie – the only lawmaker named in the post – as “one lowlife ‘Republican’”. on X: “Imagine celebrating a blessed Christmas with your family … suddenly phones alert everyone to the most powerful man in the world attacking you … for fulfilling his campaign promise to help victims!” Massie’s account cited the “one lowlife ‘Republican’” phrase in the post’s text, highlighted it in screenshots of Trump’s tirade – and asked X users to “please support me” while providing a link to his campaign donations site. More than 40 people had donated nearly $3,000 within the first two hours of the fundraising plea, Massie’s account said in separate follow-up posts. One user replying to Massie’s account described having just made “one of the few Republican contributions in my life”. “I really appreciate it, especially the day after Christmas,” the congressman’s account said. Massie has served in the US House since 2012. He has become a thorn in Trump’s side after the president’s administration failed to deliver on his promises of complete transparency with respect to Epstein’s case. He not only co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act that sailed through Congress in November. Massie also all those with connections to Epstein must face “the same kind of consequences” as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who lost his British royal title as the Duke of York over his ties to the sex offender financier. Furthermore, Massie at the time alluded to Peter Mandelson, the UK’s ambassador to the US before his firing over his association with Epstein. “There’s becoming a reckoning in Britain that needs to happen in the United States,” Massie said then. “A prince lost his title. The ambassador to the United States lost his job. We need to see those … kind of consequences here.” Trump’s justice department failed to meet the Epstein Files Transparency Act’s 19 December deadline in full, though it did release a number of materials that day. On Wednesday, the justice department said it had discovered more than a million more documents related to Epstein, and it could take “a few more weeks” to process those files for public release. Trump has endorsed a retired US Navy Seal, Ed Gallrein, to run against Massie in the Republican primary for the incumbent’s seat ahead of the 2026 midterms. that Gallrein is a “failed … establishment hack” whom Trump endorsed out of panic.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/27/mel-gibson-denies-climate-breakdown-home-burns-joe-rogan,A conversation between Joe Rogan and Mel Gibson summed up 2025 for me – and not in a good way,2025-12-27T08:00:34.000Z,"From merrily dismissing climate science, to promoting irresponsible health claims, the podcast was an unintentional warning for our times ooking back on this crazy year, one event, right at the start, seems to me to encapsulate the whole. In January, recording his podcast in a studio in Austin, Texas, the host, Joe Rogan, and the actor Mel Gibson . At the same time, about 1,200 miles away in California, Gibson’s $14m in the Palisades wildfire. In this and other respects, their discussion could be seen as prefiguring the entire 12 months. The loss of his house hadn’t been confirmed at the time of the interview, but Gibson said his son had just sent him “a video of my neighbourhood, and it’s in flames. It looks like an inferno.” According to World Weather Attribution, January’s fires in California were made by climate breakdown. Factors such as the extreme lack of rainfall and stronger winds made such fires both more likely to happen and more intense than they would have been without human-caused global heating. There’s a widespread belief that people will wake up to climate breakdown when disasters affect them. It’s equivalent to the claim that “there were no atheists in the trenches” of the first world war (if you believe this, you haven’t read Siegfried Sassoon’s Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man: Standing in that dismal ditch, I could find no consolation in the thought that Christ was risen”). For some people, disaster seems to provoke a . If your entire worldview is challenged by events, it’s tempting to conclude the events are at fault. Halfway through the interminable interview, Gibson, while disputing evolution, launched a typically detailed attack on the scientific method. “Yeah, well, there’s a lot of money in, you know, claims, and I don’t know.” Anyway, he mused: “What difference is it going to make to me?” Then he suddenly swerved to climate science, and started reciting one of the oldest denialist tropes. “Ever have a glass full of ice and watch it melt? Did you ever see the glass flow over?” “No.” “Takes up less room, you know.” In reality, sea levels are rising not because sea ice is melting, but through the , and meltwater flowing off the land. But Rogan happily took up the theme. “Well, there’s a lot of horseshit that’s involved in climate change for sure … a narrative gets established and then there’s a profit attached to the solution.” He referred to , claiming it shows “the temperature on Earth is plummeting”. As the authors keep pointing out, . But that seems to make no difference. So what did they blame for the fires? Mostly Gavin Newsom, governor of California. Rogan remarked: “How crazy it is that they spent $24bn last year on the homeless, and what do they spend on preventing these wildfires?” “Zero.” “Zip.” “He didn’t do anything.” Needless to say, this is completely untrue: California spending between 2016 and 2024. The true figure it spent on homelessness in 2024-25 was . But who gives a damn? Here we see another of the grand themes of 2025: everything is now a partisan issue, and no fact can stand in the way of polarisation. This became even starker when they turned to one of Rogan’s favourite themes, the former US chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, who has been by the radical right for a remarkable range of ills, from to the Covid pandemic. Rogan suggested Fauci’s actions were “evil”. In response, Gibson said something to the tens of millions of listeners that, in Fauci’s position, I would find highly threatening: “Well, I don’t know why Fauci’s still walking around.” “How is that guy still walking around?” Rogan echoed. This theme led to another of the year’s motifs: the whining self-pity of powerful men. Talking of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s book The Real Anthony Fauci, Rogan remarked: “They kept that book off bestseller lists … they hid it. That’s when you find out that bestseller lists are actually curated.” “Yeah,” Gibson replied, “it’s censored. It’s all censored. Everything’s censored.” In truth, depressingly enough, Kennedy’s rubbish book spent 20 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Alongside their dismissal of science-based medicine was the usual catalogue of quack cures. Gibson claimed that he had “holes” in his head, which he appeared to suggest were caused by PTSD. But he was given “a very miraculous and great remedy for it which was to eat a bunch of fish oil, vitamin B complex and get into a hyperbaric chamber for 40 sessions”. Rogan asserted that hyperbaric chambers are “phenomenal for … everything”, and can “decrease your biological age”. He gave no warning of , which can be very great. The two men promoted , “hydrochloride something or other” and and irresponsible claims that could cause Early in the interview, Rogan asked Gibson what he would do if his house had indeed burnt down. “Oh, I don’t know,” Gibson replied. “I got a place in Costa Rica. I love it there … it’s in a real nice spot.” For the very rich, it sometimes seems, even the consequences have no consequences. It now appears that Gibson has decided to . While I feel bad for the loss of his belongings, his ability to start again contrasts with the position of many poorer California residents , some of whom might have swelled the ranks of the . Gibson appeared to agree with Rogan that the state should not be spending so much on them. For now, the very rich have options. They can rebuild or move somewhere they haven’t yet wrecked, while others languish in places that might come to look like the set of Mad Max, with which, of course, Gibson is not unfamiliar. Those who rack up vast impacts then walk away, and those who spread misinformation freeload on the rest of us. They are always leaving other people to live with the consequences. There was, however, one thing Gibson said that hit home. It was while he was dismissing evolution, and claiming that everything was “ordered” by God: “I think anything left to itself without some kind of intelligence behind it will devolve into chaos.” It could be seen as a warning for our times.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/israel-first-country-to-recognise-somaliland-sovereign-state,Israel becomes first country to recognise Somaliland as sovereign state,2025-12-27T02:14:22.000Z,"Diplomatic breakthrough criticised by African Union, which said it could have ‘far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent’ Israel has become the first country to recognise as a sovereign state, a breakthrough in its quest for international recognition since it declared independence from Somalia 34 years ago. The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced on Friday that and Somaliland had signed an agreement establishing full diplomatic relations, which would include the opening of embassies and the appointment of ambassadors. The recognition is a historic moment for Somaliland, which declared its independence from in 1991 but until now had failed to be recognised by any UN member states. Somaliland controls the north-west tip of Somalia, where it operates a de facto state, and is bordered by Djibouti to the north-west and Ethiopia to the west and south. The Israeli prime minister’s office said the declaration was “in the spirit” of the Abraham accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and mostly Arab states signed in 2020. It posted a video of Benjamin Netanyahu speaking via video call with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, in which he invited him to visit Israel and described the friendship between the two countries as “historic”. Abdullahi said he would be “glad to be in Jerusalem as soon as possible”. Donald Trump said he opposed US recognition of Somaliland in an interview with the New York Post published on Friday, adding: “Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” The US administration is reportedly split over the recognition of Somaliland, with some fearing such a move could endanger military cooperation with Somalia. The US has troops deployed there, where it supports Somali forces in their fight against the Islamist movement al-Shabaab. Somalia’s foreign ministry said in statement the decision was a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty that would undermine peace in the region, a sentiment echoed by the African Union (AU). The AU said it “firmly rejects” Israel’s move, warning: “Any attempt to undermine the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Somalia ... risks setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent.” The pan-African body’s head, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, said Somaliland “remains an integral part of the Federal Republic of Somalia”, which is a member of the AU. Israel’s move was also condemned by Egypt and Turkey, which said in a statement: “This initiative by Israel, which aligns with its expansionist policy and its efforts to do everything to prevent the recognition of a Palestinian state, constitutes overt interference in Somalia’s domestic affairs.” Sa’ar said the recognition came after a year of talks between the two countries and that he had instructed Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to immediately “institutionalise ties between the two countries”. Israeli analysts have said recognition of the breakaway state could be in Israel’s strategic interest, given Somaliland’s proximity to Yemen, where Israel has conducted extensive airstrikes against the Houthi rebels over the past two years. in November by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli thinktank, said: “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base for multiple missions: intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and their armament efforts; logistical support for Yemen’s legitimate government in its war against them; and a platform for direct operations against the Houthis.” The Somaliland authorities already host a military base operated by the United Arab Emirates in Berbera, which has a military port and an airstrip for fighter jets and transport aircraft. Analysts have suggested that the base is a key part of the UAE’s anti-Houthi campaign in Yemen. in May that US military officials, including the most senior officer in the Horn of Africa, had visited Somaliland and that another US delegation was expected to visit soon. “It’s a matter of time. Not if, but when and who will lead the recognition of Somaliland,” Abdullahi told the Guardian. Project 2025, which was published in 2023 and is alleged to have guided much of the doctrine of Donald Trump’s second administration, called for the recognition of Somaliland as a “hedge against the US’s deteriorating position in Djibouti”, where Chinese influence is growing. This August, the Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote to Trump asking him to recognise Somaliland. Cruz said Somaliland was an ally of Israel and that it had expressed support for the Abraham accords. Somaliland has a population of a little more than 6.2 million. The breakaway state has a democratic system that has had peaceful transfers of power, though the Washington-based non-profit organisation Freedom House noted an “erosion of political rights and civic space” in recent years, with journalists and opposition figures facing repression from authorities.",William Christou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/27/its-frightening-how-far-right-is-infiltrating-everyday-culture,‘It’s frightening’: How far right is infiltrating everyday culture,2025-12-27T11:00:36.000Z,"Extremist messaging now woven into music and YouTube videos, with one expert saying: ‘You can be radicalised sitting on your couch’ The two men chop peppers, slice aubergines and giggle into the camera as they delve into the art of vegan cooking. Both are wearing ski masks and T-shirts bearing Nazi symbols. The German videos – titled Balaclava Kitchen – started in 2014 and before YouTube took down the channel for violating its guidelines. But it offered a glimpse of how far-right groups have seized on cultural production – from clothing brands to top 40 music – to normalise their ideas, in a process that researchers say has hit new heights in the age of social media. “It’s frightening, honestly,” said Katherine Kondor, a researcher with the Norwegian Center for Holocaust and Minority Studies. “You can be radicalised sitting on your couch.” In affiliation with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX), Kondor is leading a six-country project the extreme right uses aesthetics, from fitness influencers to memes and stickers, to spread their views across Europe. From Sweden to Spain, researchers found that extremist messaging was woven through cultural aspects of everyday life, both online and offline. “In Hungary we have some examples of extreme right bands becoming mainstream because they’re on the top 40 chart. I mean, what’s more normal than being on the top 40?” Kondor said. “I have a stepson who sometimes sends videos and then I go down the rabbit hole to see who created them and it turns out it’s a far-right influencer.” , referring to female content creators who promote traditional gender roles on social media, are another example. As the numbers of women embracing the concept online surges, the content’s have been increasingly obscured. Even so, the views they often promote – from anti-feminism to a nostalgia for an imagined past – continue to boost far-right aims. These cultural elements serve as gateways, at times helping to reel people into extremism, Kondor said. “I think there’s a mistaken idea that people join the far right because they believe in that ideology and want to meet like-minded people,” she said. “But that’s not how it works.” While there are some who are driven by prejudices against certain groups or specific beliefs, or others who tag along with friends who are already involved, many are lured by the subcultures that encase these movements, she said. “They start listening to a band that they really like and start going to concerts of that band. Then they start meeting people there and it can escalate in that way,” Kondor explained. “When people find things that work for their aesthetic or their vibe, or they find music that they really like, that can really influence a person.” The link between extreme ideas and the cultural tools they opt to use is not always straightforward, she added, citing the example of a group of far-right extremists in the Netherlands with a penchant for hosting wine-tasting events. “They’ve also started their own food delivery,” she said. “It’s just wild that you can be ordering food from the far right and not know.” Extremists have long used culture to foster a sense of belonging among its members and gain attention among the wider public, said Greta Jasser, a research associate at Germany’s Institute for Democracy and Civil Society, which is also part of the six-country project. Previously, however, their strength in doing so relied on the talent pool of their members, as musicians, artists and camera operators were needed to create content. With the advent of generative AI, this is no longer the case. “Now there’s technology that we can use to generate an image or video in an instant or music within just a couple of minutes,” said Jasser. “So the playbook is old, but the speed is much faster.” The economics of social media have also transformed the process, leading to questions regarding who is creating far-right content and their motivations. “It could be posted by a bot. It could be anyone and anything wanting to generate income from producing as many AI videos and images as possible,” said Jasser. “Which then interestingly calls into question how ideologically driven many of these accounts are, or if it’s a way to generate revenue.” As the research continues, Kondor and her team have been weighing how best to educate the public about their findings, mulling strategies such as online content or tools that could help people better recognise the far right and the myriad of cultural elements they’re producing. “I think it’s often shocking to people,” said Kondor. “Right now it’s dangerous because we’re seeing a steady rise of the far right in every aspect of society. It’s more important than ever to figure out how to mitigate this.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.
