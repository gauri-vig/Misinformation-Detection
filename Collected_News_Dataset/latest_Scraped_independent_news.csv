Read our after less than a year in the job. Meredith Maines, who started working for the Sussexes in March 2025, is believed to be the eleventh publicist in five years to exit the role after the couple stepped back from their roles as working royals and relocated to California in 2020. A statement from Ms Maines read: “After a year of inspiring work with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of , I will be pursuing a new opportunity in 2026. I have the utmost gratitude and respect for the couple and the team, and the good they are doing in the world.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have also parted ways with Method Communications, a US-based PR firm, after they announced a partnership seven months ago with the organisation that brands itself as a company that “challenges the status quo”. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said: “Meredith Maines and Method Communications have concluded their work with Archewell. The Duke and Duchess are grateful for their contributions and wish them well.” Harry and Meghan are reportedly not looking to hire a replacement for Ms Maines, as it is understood that the UK and Europe director of communications, Liam Maguire, will take the lead instead. This departure comes on the heels of last week’s announcement that Meghan and Harry’s Archewell Philanthropies, formerly known as the Archewell Foundation, would cut staff as it closes down. “The move toward a fiscal sponsor operating model does mean that some staff “We will not be discussing these personnel details further, other than to say that we are honored to have worked with incredibly talented and caring people who dedicate themselves to helping others.” Ms Maines was spotted in July speaking with senior aides working for the King outside a Mayfair private members’ club, as the Royal households appeared to take steps towards repairing their relationship. A Stanford graduate with a background in venture capitalism, Ms Maines has previously worked for Hulu, GOOP and Google. It is unclear what she will do next. Three communications officers stopped working for the Sussexes this summer, including Charlie Gipson and Kyle Boulia. Ashley Hanson, former global press secretary, stepped down a year ago to start her own consultancy firm after two years running the couple’s PR.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our In the UK and US, more than half of the average diet consists of A previous BMJ study in 2024 linked UPFs to 32 harmful health effects including a higher risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, adverse mental health and early death. , the most common cancer in the world, according to the World Cancer Research Fund. There were an estimated 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from the disease worldwide in 2020, behind the study published in the respiratory journal But limiting consumption of these foods may help curb the global impact of the disease, the Although there is no exact definition of a UPF, these foods typically undergo multiple processing steps, contain long lists of additives and preservatives, and are ready-to-eat or heat. Researchers drew on data from the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trials, involving 155,000 participants aged 55 to 74 who were randomly assigned to either a screening or comparison group between November 1993 and July 2001. Cancer diagnoses were tracked until the end of 2009, and cancer deaths until the end of 2018. A total of 101,732 people (50,187 men and 51,545 women, with an average age of 62) who completed a questionnaire on their dietary habits upon entry to the trials were included in the study. Foods were categorised as: unprocessed or minimally processed; containing processed culinary ingredients; processed; or ultra-processed. The researchers focused in particular on UPFs that included sour cream, as well as cream cheese, ice cream, frozen yoghurt, fried foods, bread, baked goods, salted snacks, breakfast cereals, instant noodles, shop-bought soups and sauces, margarine, confectionery, soft drinks, sweetened fruit drinks, restaurant/shop-bought hamburgers, hot dogs, and pizza. The three types of food that featured the most were lunch meat (11 per cent), diet or caffeinated soft drinks (just over 7 per cent) and decaffeinated soft drinks (nearly 7 per cent). Participants were tracked for 12 years and in that time, 1,706 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, including 1,473 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 233 of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). After accounting for potentially influential factors, including smoking and overall diet quality, participants who ate the most UPFs were 41 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than those who ate the least. Overall, they were 37 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with NSCLC and 44 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with SCLC. Because it was an observational study and no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, researchers acknowledge that they weren’t able to factor in smoking intensity, which may have been influential. Dietary information was collected only once, so they could not account for changes over time, and the number of cancer diagnoses was small. But researchers do highlight the low nutritional value of UPFs and the excessive amounts of salt, sugar and fats they contain. “The rise in UPF consumption may have driven global increases in obesity, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, cancer and mortality, as these foods are confirmed risk factors for such conditions,” the researchers suggested. “Industrial processing alters the food matrix, affecting nutrient availability and absorption, while also generating harmful contaminants,” they added, highlighting acrolein, which is found in grilled sausages and caramel sweets and is a toxic component of cigarette smoke. Packaging materials may also have a role to play, they suggested. “You can’t say from this study that UPFs cause cancer as it’s observational, so we’re looking at associations, not direct effects. But it does strengthen the case for looking more closely at the food environment many people are living in, where UPFs are cheap, convenient, and heavily marketed, making them a go-to for many,” Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author of He suggested, rather than “pointing figures at individual foods”, to instead make small shifts towards a healthier diet. “That might mean cooking more from scratch where possible, adding in more whole foods like vegetables, beans and grains, or just becoming more aware of how often UPFs show up in your day,” he said. “It’s not about being perfect, it’s about balance and understanding how your food choices could be supporting or undermining your long-term health.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our n a strip of calm blue water in the , a fisherman pulls a fluorescent orange stick from the We are in a boat in the waters off of Llança, a town near the Spanish-French border that heaves with British tourists in the summer months. But far from the luxury hotels and restaurants, and marine biologists are battling to save corals, sponges and other creatures from the damage caused by Rising temperatures in the sea caused by climate change are decimating the , sponge and other marine creatures which live 50 metres below the surface, where the mercury can reach 25C. Pollution caused by clumps of wet wipes and other plastics has also accumulated in some areas. Overfishing has had a dramatic effect on complex habitats, and some species, such as the precious red coral, which is commonly used for jewellery, have largely disappeared from the western Mediterranean. In a bid to fight back, fishermen on the Costa Brava are saving any corals which come up in their nets as part of a new scheme started in 2022 with the help of marine biologists. “If I want the sea to have any future, it makes sense to put something back, like these corals,” says Franc Ontiveros, a lifelong fisherman taking part in the project. “Poor management of fishing stocks has been a problem but if I can do something to help then I would like to. I am not sure fishing has a future but at least if I do this, I will be trying to do something about it.” Mr Ontiveros, 50, fishes for monkfish, mullet and hake but can haul tens of corals every day that he goes to sea. After they are plucked from the water, they are put in a bucket before being handed over to marine biologists. They are then kept in special aquariums, where they are assessed to see if they will survive. The lucky ones are returned to the seas along the Catalan coast in special “no take” zones, where authorities track the activities of boats to make sure they do not fish. Mr Ontiveros’s boat, which is based in Palamos, a Catalan fishing town famous for its prawns, is one of about 48 along this stretch of Spanish coastline that have joined this effort to protect threatened species. The haul of corals depends on the type of fishing, boats and habitat. Those who go out for red shrimps catch very few, but fishermen who trawl for fish on sea shelves have a large haul. Jordi Grinyó Andreu, a researcher at the Institute of Sea Sciences in Barcelona and an expert in seafloor ecology, has been working on the €3.6m (£3.15m) project since it started in 2022. It is partly funded by the European Union, with the rest of the funds coming from the Spanish government. “These creatures are being decimated by climate change and the destruction of their natural habitats,” he says. “We have encouraged the fishermen to take part. As one said: ‘If I want my son to be a fisherman one day, I have to act now’.” Mr Grinyó is passionate about the orange, pink and black corals he helps save with the fishermen. “The coral populations in the Mediterranean have been under high threat. Some populations are stable, others are declining and some are critically endangered, like red coral and Isidella bamboo corals,” he adds. Sadly, the fate of corals and sponges in the western Mediterranean is not an isolated one. Mr Grinyó says that seafloor ecosystems around the world face the same daunting future. But researchers hope the knowledge gained from the scheme will help save these beautiful seafloor dwellers in other parts of the sea. New projects are expected to start in the Balearic Islands, near Cadiz and in Sicily. Mr Grinyó says the cooperation between fishermen and marine biologists has given him hope for the future. “This project shows that once fishermen and scientists work together, we can achieve great goals towards preserving marine ecosystems. “In this sense, fishermen are a key component of the success of this project and they are working towards achieving a more sustainable form of fishing. Eventually the whole of society will benefit.”",The Independent,The Independent

The protesters — who were chanting “Free Palestine” and calling Trump “Hitler” — were eventually escorted out. “These people were allowed to get within arm’s length of the sitting president with knives and who knows what else in the restaurant available to them,” Fitton told the newspaper. “I’m just really concerned about the president’s safety,” Fitton added. “He was almost killed twice supposedly under the protection of the Secret Service and then they walked him into a potentially dangerous ambush,” he said of the September incident, which took place at Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. The protesters were not violent, but Fitton expressed worry that they had apparently been able to obtain accurate information about Trump’s private dinner. Fitton, whose watchdog group has over 2 million followers on social media, isn’t the only one to criticize the Secret Service over Trump’s brush-in with Code Pink.

On December 18, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in federal court attempting to obtain access to “all internal emails and text messages among USSS officials in the Presidential Protective Division regarding the presence of Code Pink protestors” at the restaurant. It also seeks any correspondence between the Secret Service and accounts affiliated with Code Pink, a feminist, anti-war organization.

The trade union boss has said that the and his cabinet need to stop playing games and be focused on the cost of living crisis in 2026. According to the findings of the poll commissioned by the TUC and and campaign group 38 Degrees, one in five (21 per cent) are skipping meals every day or most days because they cannot afford to eat or are making sacrifices for their children. More than one in three (36 per cent) are cutting back on their heating every day or most days. Four in five (79 per cent) say their financial circumstances are either stagnant or getting worse. Mr Nowak warned: “The government needs to focus relentlessly on the cost of living and then the polls will look after themselves.” Suggesting that there is too much attention to weekly polls in Downing Street, he added: “Politicians are focused on the minutiae of polls while ordinary people are focused on the minutiae of their bank accounts.” The TUC leader has applauded the workers’ rights package passed just before Christmas, adding that it was trade unions who forced a “reluctant” Labour government to ditch the two-child benefit cap. But he has insisted “there is more that needs doing”. He also warned that a failure to “deliver the ‘change’ that was on the front of the Labour manifesto” means people are turning to Reform in what he believes is a mistaken view that Mr Farage will solve their problems. The Reform UK leader has flirted with left-wing voters with promises of nationalising steel production and water companies as well as scrapping the two-child benefit cap before Labour relented on the issue. Mr Nowak said: “A lot of our [union] members vote Reform. But we should not be going around calling them racists though.” Instead he wants the Labour government to expose what a Farage-led government would really do while dealing with the actual day-to-day problems people have. He said: “A Farage-led government would be a disaster for workers. Those new rights that we’ve just secured would be under attack, a return to austerity, privatisation of our NHS, you know, his big economic reset speech where, you know, delivered it in the City of London and talked about the need to deregulate the finance sector, because that worked so well the last time round. “Obviously, trashing the relationship with our closest trading partner in terms of the European Union. So, you know, I mean, we’ve got no doubt reform would be a cul-de-sac.” But instead, Mr Nowak, like many others in the trade union movement, is concerned about the amount of infighting within the cabinet and manoeuvring by rivals to replace Sir Keir. He said: “When a government is trailing so far behind in the polls, and the PM’s personal approval ratings are low, there’s always going to be some sort of speculation. “I think it’s incumbent on everybody, the prime minister, the cabinet, the Labour government, the entire parliamentary Labour Party, you can’t afford to take your eyes off the day job, which is delivering on living standards, and indulge in the sort of internal naval gaze here, who’s up and who’s down in the cabinet.” He added: “I think there are some people who see politics as a game. I don’t think for our members, politics is a game. “I mean, this, this is the difference between, you know, for some people, it is at the sharp end about whether they are turnding on the heating or, you know, God forbid, missing a meal, because, you know, they’d rather the kids have tea, rather than, you know, them.” And while trade unions remain Labour’s biggest donors, there have been a number of larger unions which are now questioning their ongoing relationship with Labour under Sir Keir’s leadership. Unison, the biggest trade union, just elected Corbynista Andrea Egan, who wants to reduce support for Labour, while the second biggest union, Unite, is discussing disaffiliating from the party. Mr Nowak said: “Our job is not to be passive cheerleaders on the sideline, applauding everything the government does. I think our job is to work with the government to deliver on the issues that really matter to our members and their families and their communities, to call the government out when they get it wrong.”",The Independent,The Independent

With a rooftop pool, cosy outdoor and indoor eating areas, characterful period features and plenty of musical touches – including three pianos and a 16th-century harp – this hotel is a special stay in the historic centre. A smaller alternative to Malaga, Nerja lies around 30 miles to the east, perched on a section of cliffs that overlook the Alboran Sea. The town begins on the shores of Salon and Calahonda, rising steadily up through a sea of white-washed, low-lying buildings and palm-tree-filled gardens. Within the narrow, cobbled streets, a plethora of independent shops, restaurants and plazas await. Just above the beach sits the Balcon de Europa, an impressive viewpoint that gives sweeping sea views. One of the town’s most visited sites is its extensive network of caves, which stretches for over three miles and is adorned with paintings thought to date back 40,000 years. The Hotel Balcon de Europa is built into the rock face in one of the best areas of Nerja for visitors. The hotel offers comfortable, modern rooms, direct beach access and some of the best views in town. When competing alongside Gran Canaria for the second Canary recommendation on this list, comes out on top due to its amazing natural sites and charming capital. The main city of Arrecife may be smaller than Las Palmas, but its city-side beaches, colonial architecture and lively nightlife make it a worthy competitor. At the Timanfaya National Park, the sea of red rock and volcanic soil appears almost extra-terrestrial and guided hikes or bus tours are the only ways to explore. Alongside the beaches and the Hervideros cliffs, the Jameos del Agua, an oasis-like landscape that contains a cave network and cultural centre, is the other must-see. is a vast, 335-room complex with four outdoor pools, six restaurants and various sports facilities, alongside an extensive spa offering everything from a hairdresser to lava and aloe vera treatments. Andalusia’s primary seaside destination is another great alternative to Seville for a dose of winter sun. Average highs hit 18C, and though the sea may be too cold for most, both the port and the long stretch of city beach, which includes Malagueta and Caleta, are great places to walk, cycle or enjoy a laid-back afternoon meal. The historic centre demands an afternoon spent wandering its wide boulevards, narrow alleys and churro cafes, while La Concepción Historical Botanical Garden and Gibralfaro Castle offer some of the best views. Art lovers will enjoy the Thyssen Carmen Museum, which showcases a host of 19th-century Spanish art, while the birthplace of Picasso also has a fantastic museum containing over 200 of his works (part of which lies within the house where the famed artist was born). answer to Granada’s Alhambra, is the architectural highlight, where stone palaces with horseshoe arches contain gardens and courtyards lined with orange and palm trees.

Read our beach vacation is of jam-packed strips of sand lined with faceless mega-resorts. But savvy travelers can swap sprawling hotel hubs for beach towns that offer more authentic and soulful experiences. Something altogether prettier. Stretches of coast such as Puerto Escondido and La Paz shouldn’t be seen as detours, rather as destinations in their own right. To help you choose which Mexican beach town to explore, we’ve chosen eight which each have something unique to offer. There’s the castaway, car-free island on the north coast of the where you can snorkel with whale sharks; the town with nine bays and 36 ; plus one that has even been officially declared by the Puerto Escondido is a former sleepy coffee-shipping village that has transformed into a premier surf destination, but resisted going down the mega-resort route: high-rise chains are strictly banned here. The result is somewhere ideal for adventurous types, but also great for relaxing. It’s also where you’ll find one of Mexico’s prettiest beaches — Playa Carrizalillo, a perfectly formed slice of creamy sand sloping into emerald-tinted waters you can reach by descending 167 stone steps. Post-sunset, be sure to take a boat tour to the Manialtepec Lagoon where glowing plankton turns the water electric-blue. Back in town, treat yourself to fine Pacific seafood at the regionally renowned Almoraduz restaurant, then hit the sandy streets of the La Punta neighborhood for drinks in thatched-roofed bars, or head to Cactus Beach Club to sip a beer to the soundtrack of rolling waves. (rooms from $200) is a colonial-style beachfront retreat with three outdoor pools and lush tropical gardens. Colorful and carefree Sayulita, on the Pacific coast, is quiet enough to feel refreshingly different to mega-resorts like Cancun or Cabo, but has enough infrastructure for a stress-free vacation experience. It’s quintessential laid-back Mexico, where life unfolds gently and the atmosphere is welcoming. Aside from soaking up the rays — Sayulita gets 320 to 345 days of sunshine a year — the number one activity is surfing on the gently rolling waves of Sayulita Beach. There are dozens of surf schools to choose from. Another “must” is hiking the short jungle trail to shop-free Playa Carricitos for a wild-feeling sunset. For exceptional eats, there’s La Rustica, which specializes in wood-fired pizzas and seafood, while Escondido Bar is a seductive, chic venue for a post-dinner cocktail. (rooms from $220) has mesmerizing minimalist-boho interiors, an ocean-front pool and direct access to Sayulita Beach. Welcome to Sayulita’s even more laid-back neighbor, officially called San Francisco, but known almost universally among locals and travelers (and many hotels) as San Pancho. This soulful destination is where you can soak up the sun without the crowds by day, then watch it disappear in near-silence at night. In fact, watching the sun dissolve into the horizon from the golden sweep of Playa San Pancho beach is one of the marquee activities here. Another feel-good experience is exploring the EntreAmigos Community Centre, a cross between a library, art space and fair-trade shop that’s often referred to as “the heart of the town”. Make time, too, for a guided estuary walk to the nearby La Patrona Polo & Equestrian Club wetlands, which sit on the edge of a tropical forest. Look out for American crocodiles, iguanas and the occasional armadillo. For food, Barracuda San Pancho offers the best dinner in town (think ceviche and grilled fish), while La Cervecería San Pancho is where you’ll find locals and long-stay travelers sipping small-batch Mexican beers and mezcal cocktails. (rooms from $190) has lush gardens, a small pool and is just 10 minutes away by foot from the beach. Isla Mujeres is the calm Caribbean counterpoint to constantly thrumming Cancun. The island is just a 15-minute ferry ride away from the city, but you’ll disembark into a far-less hectic haven of world-class beaches and all-round good vibes. One of the biggest draws is the waters that surround the five-mile-long strip of land. Don a snorkel mask to view a rich reef ecosystem that’s home to fish including sergeant majors, blue tangs and angelfish, as well as a spellbindingly surreal underwater sculpture museum. Other magnets for travelers include the stunning Playa Norte beach, with its velvety sand, and the island’s colourful streets, shops and restaurants, which can be explored by golf cart, rented from one of the many hire shops. (rooms from $150) has a prime position in front of the island’s signature Playa Norte beach and boasts two outdoor pools, plus rooms with air-conditioning and free wifi. The barefoot paradise of Isla Holbox stands in sharpest contrast to Mexico’s resort complexes. This 26-mile-long, one-mile-wide castaway car-free island on the north coast of the is where you can go to unplug from civilization, without being too far away from it. Fill your days here with watching the sun rise, flopping in a hammock, going for a swim, strolling the sandy streets, then watching the sun set from the wide west-facing beaches. Later, head to open-air bar Hot Corner for cocktails and live music. Create a window, too, for a whale shark boat tour if you visit between mid-May and mid-September. The gentle giants gather in the plankton-rich waters offshore during this period, and tourists are allowed to jump in and snorkel alongside them. It’s a (carefully regulated) experience that will long live on in your memory. (rooms from $280) has direct access to a postcard-perfect stretch of sand, and the all-important hammocks. Put under-the-radar-gem Huatulco firmly on your radar, because this is one of Mexico’s cleanest, safest and calmest coastal destinations. The signature experience here is exploring its nine protected Pacific Ocean bays (“Las Bahías de Huatulco”) and 36 beaches by boat. You’ll be able to leap into Instagrammable waters inhabited by dolphins and sea turtles and admire the area’s cove-cut cliffs. Also not to be missed is a guided nature walk into the Huatulco National Park, a world of mangroves and tropical forests that’s home to crocodiles, iguanas and armadillos, as well as a spectacular array of birdlife. Cure hunger pangs with a trip to Terra-Cotta restaurant, which is known for its coffee-rubbed meats and coconut shrimp. For a nightcap, head to La Crema Bar, which is decorated with colorful murals and serves tequila cocktails to customers perched on stiletto-shaped stools. (rooms from $325) is family-friendly with a kids-only pool and spacious suites. At La Paz, on the Sea of Cortez, the beaches set the rhythm of life. The standout is Balandra, which has blinding white sand and clear water that’s knee-to-waist-high up to 500 feet out from the shore at low tide. The ecosystem is fragile here, so visitor numbers are capped and you’ll need to book a slot. For a memorable meal, book a table at local-favorite Nim, where tuna tiradito and grilled octopus are among the house specialities. Then get your nightcap fix at La Miserable (don’t be put off by the name), which serves artisanal cocktails in a rustic lantern-festooned courtyard. rooms from $145) is located in the historic center and boasts a rooftop pool and smart, minimalist rooms. Loreto will hold you under a spell. And that’s official — the government of Mexico has designated it one of the Where does the enchantment lie? Certainly at the Loreto Bay National Marine Park, which you can explore via a boat tour. This Unesco-listed marine sanctuary is made up of five uninhabited islands in nutrient-rich waters where dolphins, sea lions and even blue whales and humpbacks can be spotted. Back on dry land, the 17th-century Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto, the first mission in all of Baja California, bewitches with its stone façade and fascinating museum next door. The enchiladas and homemade soups at restaurant Mi Loreto will be another memorable part of your trip.

Read our Hundreds of hunting supporters defied opposition from Chris Packham and the local council in Tiverton to gather for the - despite being told they are “not welcome”. The television presenter had branded the event “ethically and morally bankrupt” as he urged councillors in the Devon town to went ahead despite Tiverton Town Council voting to back a motion declaring: “The hunt meet is not welcome in Tiverton on Boxing Day, or any other day.” Hundreds turned out to support the Tiverton Foxhounds, who have met on Boxing Day outside the Half Moon pub in the town square for around 200 years. Addressing the crowd from horseback on Friday, Kelvin Thomas, of Tiverton Foxhounds, vowed to meet again next year and told Mr Packham to stay out of rural affairs. He said: “He’s been very, very vocal about joining the lobby who are not going to welcome us here today. So, despite the fact several of his bosses at the BBC have already jumped over the side, hopefully he won’t be too far behind. “Better if he just left rural issues to us and he got on with his job and the urban Government got on with theirs, we’d all get along, no issue. Apparently we’re not welcome and you’re not welcome – but nice to see you anyway.” Around 50 protesters, holding placards and a cardboard cutout of Mr Packham, also gathered in the town before the huntsman blew his horn at around 11am. It comes as hunt supporters vowed to fight Sir Keir Starmer’s as thousands attended traditional Boxing Day meets across the country on Friday. The government announced its plans to crackdown on the sport, claiming trail hunting – where packs of hounds follow a scent laid for them – was too often being used as a smokescreen for illegal foxhunting. The Countryside Alliance has defended trail hunting, introduced to comply with the Hunting Act 2004’s ban on pursuing foxes. The group claimed hunts contribute more than £100 million a year to the rural economy. The pressure group this week warned Starmer had “alienated rural people”, with a poll suggesting 65 per cent of voters think the Labour administration unfairly neglects country communities. Despite a partial U-turn, there is still lingering resentment among farming communities over changes to inheritance tax breaks. Will Bryer, joint master of the Duke of Beaufort Hunt, said the countryside was “under assault and siege”, and said the government would have a “fight” on its hands. Addressing thousands of spectators at the major trail hunting meet near Badminton, Gloucestershire, on Friday ,he said: “I just wonder whether our government would have made that announcement had they predicted a turnout like this. “It is somewhat ironic, is it not, that the government choose to announce their intentions to destroy trail hunting just at a time of year when we reaffirm our beliefs. “So just ask yourselves: Why did you come today? Was it because you believe in a connection to the land and to your farmers? “Was it because you believe in preserving British cultural heritage? Was it because you believe in hunting? “So, we’re under assault, we’re under siege and like all fights it’s going to get messy. But we must, we must stand united. “So, because of my age, I’m going to say take the words from that 1980s super-ballad, take the words from Journey’s song, Don’t Stop Believing. Hunting has a future, hunting will endure.” The Grove Rufford Hunt gathered in the main street in Bawtry, South Yorkshire, before more than 100 riders set out for the nearby village of Scaftworth. Speaking outside The Crown Inn, chairman and master Jane Bowen pleaded for the government to “please leave us alone”. She added: “We are misunderstood. They refuse to engage with us on any level. “And, if they come to visit the kennels, of which anybody is welcome at any time, and actually see and understand what we do, then I think they’ll have a different view. “We all have different views, that is the choice of a democracy, or was. And we choose to do this, and we do it legally, as we have for 20 years. So, please leave us alone.” The proposed ban, Labour election manifesto pledge, was celebrated by animal rights groups after years of clashes over whether genuine trail hunting takes place. A public consultation on the ban is due to launch in early 2026. Protect the Wild’s Rob Pownall said: “Boxing Day hunts are deliberately staged as tradition and spectacle, designed to normalise behaviour that would be unacceptable on any other day of the year. “Resisting them isn’t about disrupting celebrations, it’s about refusing to let cruelty towards wildlife be rebranded as culture. “When the law is weakly enforced and suffering is hidden behind ceremony, peaceful resistance becomes both legitimate and necessary.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Christmas Eve turned into a nightmare for one family after a 19-year-old woman vanished from her Camila Mendoza Olmos was last seen just before 7 a.m. Wednesday outside her home, according to the Authorities say she appeared to be heading out for what her family believed was just a routine walk. Surveillance video shows Camila wearing baby blue pajama shorts, a black hoodie and white shoes as she rummaged through her car before the footage cut off, officials said. Her vehicle was left at the home, and investigators believe she walked away carrying only her car keys and possibly her driver’s license. The morning she disappeared, Camila had been sleeping in the same bed as her mother, Rosario Olmos. She told that she felt her daughter get up but stayed in bed for about 90 minutes before checking on her. When she realized Camila was gone, Rosario tried calling her, but then found her daughter’s phone turned off and left on the bed. “I called her cell phone, but the cell phone was there on the bed and it was turned off,” Rosario said. “I put it to charge and went out to look for her. I thought I would find her like other times, walking, and we would come home together.” Rosario searched the neighborhood, believing she would spot her daughter on her usual route, but she was nowhere to be found. After contacting Camila’s boyfriend and father, both of whom said they had not seen or heard from her, she filed a missing persons report. A CLEAR (Coordinated Law Enforcement Adult Rescue) Alert was also issued for Camila, who is listed as missing and “possibly endangered.” Family and friends spent Christmas Day searching areas near the home but found no sign of her, Rosario said, adding that it is completely out of character for Camila to disappear without telling anyone where she was going. “I only ask God to please bring her back home,” Rosario told KENS5. “Bring her back to me. Friends said Camila regularly went on walks, but that she always stayed on the phone with someone during them. “It’s been very out of the normal,” her friend, Isabela told . “It’s not like her. She’s always been the one to always stalk on us and like, ‘why aren’t you doing this?’ [She would] make sure that her phone’s always charged.” As hundreds of loved ones and community members search for Camila, her family pleads for her safe return. “It’s been real hard,” Camila’s father, Alfonso Mendoza, told KSAT. “Please come home,” he added in a plea to his daughter. “Daddy’s missing you.” Her brother, Carlos Mendoza, flew back to Texas after learning she was missing and has been searching on foot with volunteers. “We’ve been searching on foot within a three-mile radius,” Mendoza said. “I want her to come back.” Anyone who may have seen or heard from her is asked to contact the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office at 210-335-6000.",The Independent,The Independent

Other must-visit Unesco landmarks include a causeway in formed by ancient volcanic activity, five villages in Italy worthy of a Disney movie, and a perfectly preserved old city in Croatia. These are seven of the most mesmerizing examples: Unesco sites that truly live up to the hype — and then some. A breathtaking series of turquoise lakes and waterfalls. Plitvice Lakes National Park is every bit the surreal, fairytale landscape you might imagine. It comprises 16 aquamarine, terraced lakes that stretch for around five miles through a narrow limestone valley, with over 90 waterfalls spilling over them. On paper, the math doesn’t add up — 16 lakes, 90 waterfalls — but a defining characteristic of the site is that the lakes are divided by hundreds of limestone dams formed over thousands of years from accumulations of minerals in the water. The water flows over, through and around these barriers at multiple points, creating dozens of individual cascades. The result is a landscape that’s constantly evolving — in fact, the barriers grow around 0.4 inches per year. So it’s not just Instagrammers who flock to this globally exceptional site, but scientists, too. Swimming is forbidden, but visitors can stroll along raised wooden boardwalks just inches from the water. Plitvice is located between Zagreb, Croatia’s capital city, and the coast, with the drive from Zagreb airport lasting around two hours and regular buses taking two and a half hours. (rooms from around $90) is the only hotel located within the park boundaries, making early park entry easy. It features an indoor swimming pool, rooms with free wifi and a complimentary breakfast buffet. This land of lofty sandstone columns up to 1,300ft in height and crowned with religious sanctuaries is as otherworldly as it looks in photographs. The improbable pillars, in the center of mainland , were formed over 30 million years through seismic uplift, with wind and rain eroding the softer rock around them. Drawn by the promise of complete solitude, monks began settling on top of the spires from the 11th century onwards, using ropes, pulleys, nets, and nerves of steel. At one point, there were 24 monasteries in the complex of Meteora — which means “suspended in the air” — with six active today. Thankfully, no ropes or nets are required. Visitors can ascend to the monasteries via staircases carved into the rock. But note, the climb could be a challenge for some. The sanctuaries, home to around 50 nuns and 17 monks, comprise frescoed chapels, compact museums and candle-lit courtyards, with heavenly views across the Thessalian plain guaranteed. Each monastery charges an entrance fee that’s typically around $3–$6 per person, payable in cash. Though each monastery has a car park, capacity is limited. It’s advisable to book a tour. The nearest airport is Thessaloniki, which is around three hours away by car. Trains from Thessaloniki to nearby Kalambaka town take up to four hours and offer scenic countryside views. From , it’s a four-hour drive, with direct trains taking roughly the same amount of time. (rooms from $90) is located in Kastraki village right at the foot of the Meteora rocks. Rooms have balconies with views of the rock pillars. The red-walled Alhambra palace complex in Granada, perched on a narrow promontory known as Sabika Hill, 2,500ft up, is like a fantasy made real. It dates back more than 700 years, a richly decorated, eye-opening legacy of the Nasrid Dynasty that covers roughly 35 acres and contains over 10,000 Arabic inscriptions, lush gardens, a fountain supported by 12 marble lions, reflective pools and stunning geometric tilework. The palace reached its architectural peak in the 13th and 14th centuries under Nasrid rulers including Yusuf I and Muhammad V. It fell into the hands of Catholic monarchs in 1492 and was revamped by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in the 16th century. Then during the Napoleonic occupation French troops attempted to blow it up. Fortunately, they were only partially successful. Booking tickets in advance is essential, as entry is strictly timed. The highlights are the Nasrid Palaces, the Generalife gardens, the former sultans’ summer retreat, and the viewpoints that offer mesmerizing views over From Madrid, hop on a high-speed train. The journey time to Granada is around three hours and 15 minutes. It’s a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Malaga Airport and up to a two-hour journey by train. (rooms from $220) is the only hotel within the Alhambra grounds, with guests allowed early morning and late-evening access to avoid the crowds. A stunning Gothic-style abbey perched on a rocky islet in the midst of vast tidal sandbanks, with a village in the shadow of its walls. One of Europe’s most famous silhouettes, Le Mont-Saint-Michel looks as though it has unfolded from the pages of a storybook. The Benedictine abbey at its center was built between the 11th and 16th centuries on a 260-foot-high outcrop, with monks stacking chapels and halls on top of each other and later adding fortified walls and ramparts to create a monastery-cum-stronghold. The village around grew from the Middle Ages onwards, erected by traders and craftsmen to serve pilgrims. Add in the monumental tides that ebb and flow around the outcrop and you’re left with a landmark that’s a must for any European vacation bucket list. Access used to be via a causeway, but a half-mile-long pedestrian bridge was built in 2014 that links Mont-Saint-Michel to the mainland. The most memorable approach is on foot, though a shuttle bus is available. Once there, wander the medieval village and admire the tour-de-force artistry of the abbey above. For the most magical experience, stay overnight. The nearest major airport is Rennes, which is an hour away by car. Paris is around a four-hours drive, and high-speed TGV trains taking up to three hours to reach Rennes. (rooms from $260) is on the island itself. It has a great omelette restaurant and allows you to experience a more monastic post-day-tripper atmosphere. A spectacular cluster of around 40,000 black basalt polygonal columns rising from the sea in tightly interlocking formations. A visitor attraction for over 300 years, and one that legend says was built by giants. The origins of the Giant’s Causeway may not lie with giants, but it’s none the less legendary. The columns, which rise to around 39ft, were formed when lava flows cooled some 60 million years ago, cracking into remarkably regular geometric shapes. This phenomenon, known as columnar jointing, is exceptionally rare at this scale, giving the site global geological importance. Explore the nearby clifftop visitor center, then either walk down the steep path to the stones or take the shuttle bus. You’re free to walk directly on the columns — a photo opportunity an epoch in the making — but spare time, too, for the clifftop paths, which deliver sweeping coastal views. The Giant’s Causeway lies on the north coast of Northern Ireland, around one hour and 15 minutes by car from (rooms from around $200) has open fires and cozy lounges, and sits just a few minutes’ drive from the Causeway. Five candy-colored cliffside villages that resemble scenes from a They truly are the stuff of make-believe — some of the most picturesque villages in the world. Cinque Terre means “Five Lands” in Italian, and refers to a quintet of historic coastal settlements that lie along a roughly nine-mile stretch of the eastern Ligurian coast between Levanto and La Spezia — Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. These hamlets first emerged clustered around tiny harbors and rocky inlets, then expanded vertically in tight formations, as there was no room to spread out horizontally. Linger. Take your time exploring the alleyways, impossibly cute restaurants, and small coves in each village, and try to visit outside the busy summer season (June to September) if possible. Driving between the villages is not recommended. There is no direct road linking them, and parking is very limited. Instead, take the Cinque Terre Express train, which stops at all five villages, or hike the coastal footpaths for dramatic views — and to work up an appetite for seafood lunches. The nearest major airport is Pisa International Airport. From there, take the train to La Spezia, then hop on local trains to each village. Cinque Terre is about two and a half hours by train from Florence. (rooms from around $200) is located in Monterosso al Mare, nestled in a pine forest just a short walk from the sea. It has 50 en-suite rooms and free wifi. One of the planet’s most perfectly preserved medieval cities, and a The “Pearl of the Adriatic” is indeed a jewel, a walled city dating back hundreds of years. It has somehow managed to keep its beautiful churches, monasteries, palaces and fountains intact, surviving an earthquake in 1667 and was rebuilt to Unesco specifications after suffering damage in the Croatian War of Independence in the 1990s. The city is enclosed by 1.2 miles of stone walls that make for a scintillating stroll. You can walk right along the top of them and drink in superb views of the city’s terracotta rooftops and the Adriatic Sea beyond. The nearest airport is Dubrovnik, which is around 30 minutes away by car. From the airport, visitors typically take a taxi or shuttle bus to the Old City gates. (rooms from $300) is housed in a historic villa built in 1913, and boasts sweeping views of the glistening sea and the Old City.

A third of the capital city was left without heat in sub-zero weather conditions as , and a nearly 10-hour air raid alert for the capital only ended at 11.20am (9.20am GMT). Authorities said two people were killed in Kyiv and the surrounding region, while at least 46 people were wounded, including two children. The intense bombardments come after Mr Zelensky said that the 20-point plan draft was 90 per cent complete ahead of his meeting with President Trump on Sunday. The Ukrainian leader told reporters on Saturday afternoon that he was en route to his US counterpart’s Mar-a-Lago Florida residence, making a stop in Canada on the way to meet his close ally Mark Carney, the prime minister. Security guarantees and territorial issues in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia are set to dominate discussions, as they remain key sticking points in ending the war. Mr Zelensky said the country has its “red lines”, but he remained certain a compromise could be found. President Zelensky said, shortly before boarding the plane to the US, that the massive bombardment spoke volumes about Putin’s “true attitude” towards peace. “There have been many questions over the past few days – so where is Russia’s response to the proposals to end the war offered by the United States and the world? Russian representatives engage in lengthy talks, but in reality, Kinzhals and ‘shaheds’ [drones] speak for them,” he wrote in a post on X. “This is the true attitude of Putin and his inner circle. They do not want to end the war and seek to use every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering and increase their pressure on others around the world. And this means that the pressure in response is still insufficient.” Moscow has demanded that Ukraine withdraws from a large, densely urbanised chunk of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to capture. Kyiv wants the fighting to stop at the current lines. A US compromise hopes to create a free economic zone if Ukraine’s troops pull back from parts of Donetsk, although details remain a grey area. Mr Zelensky has said the shape of US security guarantees is crucial to peace, and these would depend on what Mr Trump is “ready to give, when he is ready to give it, and for how long”. earlier this week that the US had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression. If unable to push the US to support Ukraine’s position in terms of land, Mr Zelensky has said he is willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum. In order to allow for the democratic process, Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote. Mr Trump said the US was the driving force behind the process, but that he believed Sunday’s meeting would go well. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” the US president told He also said he expected to speak with Mr Putin “soon, as much as I want”.",The Independent,The Independent

While inflation recently came in lower than expected — it was up 2.7 percent year-over-year in November — experts said many firms continue to shoulder added expenses to avoid raising prices for consumers. “These companies are acutely aware of the affordability crisis confronting the average American,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale University’s school of management, told the outlet. “They are doing their best to offset the cost of tariffs and higher interest rates but can only do so much. Those with pricing power will pass on the costs over time … others will fold.” The White House, however, has lauded tariffs as a net positive for the country. , and unprecedented National Security for the USA,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. “Trade deficit has been cut by 60%, totally unheard of. 4.3% GDP, and going way up. No inflation!!! We are respected as a Country again.” The increase in bankruptcy filings was most notable among industrials — firms linked to construction, manufacturing and transportation, the noted. The industry ranks among those hit hardest by Trump’s tariffs, with the manufacturing sector posting 70,000 job losses year-over-year in November. Consumer-oriented companies offering “discretionary” services or products, including those in home furnishing or fashion, made up the second-biggest group. There was also a sizable surge in “mega bankruptcies” — filing by firms with over $1 billion in assets. Among the businesses that filed for bankruptcy in 2025 was , a low-cost carrier. The Florida-based company filed for Chapter 11 in August, marking its second filing in less than 12 months. PosiGen, a solar company headquartered in Louisiana, followed suit in November, blaming the decision on the administration’s renewable energy policies, including tariffs on imported materials and cuts to tax incentives that had made solar panels more affordable. Federal data analyzed by Jason Miller, a business professor at Michigan State University, showed the effective tariff rate on solar materials imported into the U.S. rose to about 20 percent after May, up from less than 5 percent in previous years. “That places a lot of strain on cash flow, especially for smaller importers,” Miller told the . “You then combine this with reduced federal incentives that have to be negatively impacting demand, and you have a perfect storm for elevated rates of bankruptcy.” Martin-Schoenberger, a KPMG economist, added that the surge in bankruptcies highlights contradictions in the U.S. economy. Data published by the government this week revealed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the fastest rate in two years. But economists warned that this growth is not evenly spread out, arguing its largely fueled by spending from wealthier consumers and corporate investments in “We have an economy that looks strong on paper, but that might not necessarily be reflected in every single industry,” Martin-Schoenberger said.",The Independent,The Independent

Silvinei Vasques, the former director of Brazil’s Federal Highway Police, was extradited to Brazil on Friday night, after he had secretly entered Paraguay and attempted to board a flight to using Paraguayan documents.

Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison in September for attempting a coup to remain in office despite his 2022 electoral defeat.

Read our back in the 1970s, a teenage girl was gunned down on a street – and now, a retired detective believes her killing could be linked to Berkowitz, as he calls for the case to be reopened. Mike Lorenzo, whose father worked the Berkowitz investigation, told that the 1970 murder of 16-year-old Margaret Inglesia bears striking similarities to the crimes that would later make Berkowitz one of the most infamous serial killers in “This is a case that needs to be reexamined,” said Lorenzo, who is working with Son of Sam expert Manny Grossman, to urge the to reopen the decades-old case. Lorenzo spent 20 years with the Yonkers Police Department before retiring in 2008. “This was Son of Sam before Son of Sam.” On October 18, 1970, around 2 a.m., Inglesia was walking home from a party when she was shot on East 169th Street between Morris and Grant avenues in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. She was shot once in the front and twice in the back as she lay dying, according to a witness report at the time. Her killing was the only fatal shooting in a string of six attacks carried out by an unidentified sniper on the same block over a two-month span that year. No arrests were ever made. But Lorenzo and Grossman believe Berkowitz, who was 17 at the time, could have been the one responsible. From June 1970 to June 1971, Berkowitz worked about a mile away from the attacks, at his father’s business, Melrose Hardware, before leaving to join the U.S. Army. They also point to evidence uncovered after Berkowitz’s 1977 arrest, including 100-yard shooting targets found in his home, as sign he may have been honing long-distance shooting skills before his notorious killing spree. “Why would he have 100-yard targets? He’s not a hunter,” Lorenzo pointed out. The theory comes with notable differences. Berkowitz’s confirmed attacks between 1976 and 1977 were carried out at close range, using a .44-caliber revolver, often firing through car windows. The Bronx sniper used a .22-caliber rifle. Still, Lorenzo argues the similarities outweigh the discrepancies. “It wasn’t right next door to the father’s shop but it wasn’t 20 miles away or in another borough and it fits his M.O.,” Lorenzo said. “It’s the same thing as the Son of Sam killings but just a different kind of gun. Shooting into a car is sniping too.” in the 1970s was already unraveling – financially strained, crime-ridden, and fearful. But between July 1976 and August 1977, that fear escalated when a faceless gunman stalked young women and couples across the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. Calling himself the “Son of Sam,” the killer taunted police and the media with handwritten letters and random violence. Berkowitz, a Yonkers postal worker, was eventually identified as the shooter who murdered six people and wounded seven others, including teenagers and young couples sitting in parked cars. After more than a year of false leads and mounting panic, a parking ticket near the scene of the final shooting led police to Berkowitz’s car and he was arrested on August 10, 1977. He was convicted in 1978 of six counts of second-degree murder and seven counts of attempted second-degree murder, and sentenced to 25 years to life. Now 72, Berkowitz remains incarcerated at Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Ulster County. Lorenzo said the Bronx sniper case had troubled him long before he began working with Grossman on other Son of Sam-related investigations. “I really think there’s something in those files,” Lorenzo said. The two have previously helped uncover a previously unknown Berkowitz victim – in the Bronx after being struck five times while sitting in her car. “I found out about Wendy because I found the sketch she did of her shooter that was an exact match of Berkowitz,” Grossman told “Then I found a police report that showed her shooting had all the characteristics of a Son of Sam shooting.” He then cold called Savino and says she told him that she had identified Berkowitz as her shooter in 1977 right after his arrest. “She never forgot his face,” he added. First Grade Detective Robert Klein, who concluded Savino had been shot by Berkowitz, despite Berkowitz denying the crime during a prison interview, police sources said. Interest in the Son of Sam case has surged again in recent years, fueled most recently by a Netflix that revisits Berkowitz’s crimes using never-before-heard prison recordings and archival footage. Grossman believes the Inglesia case deserves a closer look — whether or not Berkowitz ultimately proves to be the killer. “This is a major case that’s been forgotten,” Grossman said. “There’s a perp out there and we think it’s Berkowitz.”",The Independent,The Independent

It comes as the UN has warned the military-controlled ballot is unfolding amid “intensified violence, intimidation and arbitrary arrests, leaving no space for free or meaningful participation”.

A lawyer in Bangkok says she recently had dental trouble but did not receive proper medical assistance. Her family have not heard from her directly in two years . The 80-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has not been seen in public since the coup that overthrew the government in 2021. has been told that Ms Cooper is deeply concerned about the situation in the country and Ms Suu Kyi’s ongoing imprisonment. : “The UK government continues to condemn the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. The military regime must release her and all those who are arbitrarily detained. “The UK continues to shine a spotlight on Myanmar, including through our role at the UN Security Council.” Sean Turnell, Ms Suu Kyi’s former economic policy adviser, spent 650 days in custody after the coup and branded the election “an utter sham.” “It’s not even close to being a fair election,” he told . “I wish we were using a different word than ’election’ – a label that conveys nothing about this act of public intimidation that seeks to put lipstick on a particularly grotesque pig. “The military are planning to stay absolutely in control. It’s very important for the international community right at the get-go to call the election out for what it is. Because this is really nothing but theatre.” Ms Suu Kyi was sentenced to 33 years in jail after a series of show trials, later reduced to 27 years, and is being held in solitary confinement. A after refusing to speak out against her country’s extreme violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority, she is still seen by some as The junta has insisted, without providing evidence, that the former leader “is in good health”, but her family fear the worst. “She has ongoing health issues,” her son Kim Aris said in a recent interview. “Nobody has seen her in over two years. “She hasn’t been allowed contact with the legal team, let alone the family. For all I know, she could be dead already. I don’t think she would consider these elections to be meaningful in any way.” The first phase of the vote, scheduled for 28 December, comes amid a climate of armed conflict, mass displacement and economic collapse, the UN said. Since 18 August, when the junta announced the election dates, at least 862 airstrikes have been conducted in 121 townships. Most recently, a hospital in Rakhine state was bombed, killing more than 30 people, while 18 more were killed when bombs fell on a teashop in the central Sagaing region while they were watching a football match. The official election map shows large areas in the east, west and north where no polls will be held, while the entire map is dotted with large expanses where, the junta claims, “elections will take place at a later date”. “These elections are clearly taking place in an environment of violence and repression,” the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, warned this week. “There are no conditions for the exercise of the rights of freedom of expression, association or peaceful assembly.” Thousands of opponents were jailed after the coup, all protests have been criminalised, and dissenters face harsh punishment. Three young artists in Yangon who put up anti-election posters were sentenced to 42 and 49 years. Elsewhere, a man who tore down a candidate list was jailed for 17 years. A young man called Ko Nay Thway, in the city of Taunggyi, wrote on Facebook: “If [the junta] want the votes from the people, [they should] think of serving the people”. In response, he was sentenced to seven years under the new Election Protection Law. Hanthar Nyein, a Myanmar journalist released after four years in jail in Yangon, said: “The military has just three ways of getting and remaining in power: seizing power in a coup, establishing an appearance of legitimacy through a fake party, then ruling permanently from behind the scenes using a puppet parliament. “The 2008 constitution states that the army must play the leading role in national politics. The army claims that only its ‘guardianship’ prevents the nation, with its numerous ethnic minorities, from disintegrating.” Critics argue it is military rule itself which has shattered the nation. Sir John Jenkins, a former UK ambassador to Myanmar, told : “The generals may think they can solidify their tyranny on the back of a rigged win and perhaps even pretend to be magnanimous in the phoney aftermath. “I wish it could be an opportunity for international actors to refocus on what matters: justice for all the people of Burma.

Read our leaders and executives will feel it has been a particularly expensive year as the cost of employment shot up, inflation of raw materials impacted supply chains and both oil and tariff shocks hit in the first half of the year. But perhaps the biggest cost of all was one borne by companies hit by suggests that close to half of British businesses (43 per cent) and three in 10 charities (30 per cent) claimed to have suffered a type of cybersecurity breach or attack in the past year. These include anything from a phishing attack The list of those affected includes some of Britain’s biggest businesses. . Adidas. Co-op Group. Heathrow airport. Harrods. And, of course, (JLR). Each has suffered publicly confirmed cyber hacks. These attacks were not limited to companies either: the German parliament also suffered a breach and, in October, the UK government Organisations have to fight a moving target, one with seemingly limitless capabilities. This isn’t a foe a business and kill and move on from – cyber attacks come in all different ways, from all points of the earth and if one attempt doesn’t work, it just keeps coming. Jason Soroko, a cybersecurity expert and host of the podcast, put it bluntly: “For cyber attacks, 2025 was brutal. 2026 will be worse.” Attackers aren’t just looking to break into digital vaults and extract cash. Data has become incredibly valuable, while damage to economic or manufacturing operations can provide an opportunity for someone else to pick up the slack in demand, meaning state-level involvement is part of the picture at times, too. The truth is, for a business, lost sales are only part of the picture – there’s reputational damage to consider, possible reimbursement or lost opportunity costs, the loss of ongoing clients to rivals and, obviously, the amount spent to fix and then upgrade their own systems too. Cybersecurity Ventures, a noted source of data and research in the cybersecurity sphere, the entire “industry” was worth around $10.5 trillion (£7.8 trillion) this year alone. In country terms, this would make it the third-biggest economy in the world after only the US and China. For individual companies, the reliance is on their accountancy estimates being made public. M&S originally said the hit to its profits would be in the region of £300m, but in November JLR was not so fortunate as it had not renewed its cyber insurance specifically, meaning it would bear the brunt saw more than 6 million customers’ data stolen, with the final tally Elsewhere, the “cost” is more difficult to place a figure on, but is more wide-ranging and potentially damaging. JLR’s shutdown was big and prolonged enough to contribute towards an economic downturn: car production failed to rebound in September and October across the industry and was one of the big factors in UK GDP contracting by 0.1 per cent in the latter month. There are several good reasons why companies cannot keep cyber crime at bay. Attacks can be multi-pronged in style or timing and have the advantage of being proactive: those in defence must rely on seeing what the attackers are doing and respond accordingly. “Attackers now deploy AI at a speed defenders simply haven’t matched. It’s an asymmetry that widens by the month. Defenders have been slow to adopt stronger authentication, which is like failing to fit better locks on the doors. The attackers take advantage of this,” explained Mr Soroko, who works with online security firm Sectigo. Cybersecurity Ventures, meanwhile, estimates that the “frequency of ransomware attacks on governments, businesses, consumers, and devices will continue to rise [...] to hit once every two seconds by 2031.” It’s a lot to stop – and that’s just the digital version. What about when humans get involved? We know about through texts, emails and more. Why would it be any different for ordinary people at work? “We’re currently seeing youths socially engineer their way into global businesses. After online research and exploiting other breaches to obtain information, a single phone call to a help desk can be enough to persuade them to reset passwords or MFA [multi-factor authentication] tokens,” explained Tim Rawlins, security director at the cyber firm NCC Group. “This opens the door for criminals to move across systems and escalate their access until they have the same level of access as IT teams do.” Co-op notably opted to pull the plug, as it were, locking out those hacking them but also limiting its own initial powers of response as it was deemed that was the safest course of action. The government’s cyber report notes even the biggest firms don’t actually have a set course of action for if they are hit: 53 per cent of medium businesses and 75 per cent of large ones have “have an incident response plan”, it suggests. “Following breaches, organisations can’t afford knee-jerk fixes,” Mr Rawlins adds. “Organisations must work with cyber experts to rebuild their systems safely; seeing how the hackers were able to infiltrate, what they accessed, and how a breach is impacting critical business systems.” But this is a wide-ranging topic, a brand new area for many businesses to deal with and an area of high expertise needed. As such, many remain underprepared to deal with it. Research from compliance company IO suggests that a third of British and American companies don’t feel that governments are doing enough to support and protect them. The pace of technological change means firms are facing an awful lot of “the same, but different”. Hackers looking to exploit gaps in security, individuals unwittingly opening or accessing files, and even external or third-party contributors accidentally letting outsiders in have all been part of the equation this year. Companies essentially have to defend against what they cannot see coming – plus there’s no telling when attackers themselves might decide a particular target is now the ideal one. Moody’s, the global ratings firm, says cyber attacks on banks in particular “are rising and becoming more sophisticated”. If you thought being unable to order a click & collect from M&S for a couple of months was bad, try imagining not being able to make payments, withdraw cash or check your balance. Happily, it does note most banks have “robust defences”, though those financial institutions using technological infrastructure “developed decades ago” and simply building new apps and processes on top of it do present an ongoing concern. Simply put, it’s a race to a never-in-sight finish line to keep security systems updated. For some businesses next year, the question will at some stage inevitably turn to what the best method of containment is, rather than how to keep attackers out. Once the defences are breached, the answer to that question can be a difference worth many, many millions.",The Independent,The Independent

Redd — who has shared the stage with jazz greats like Charlie Byrd, Dizzy Gillespie, and Barney Kessel — confirmed that he pulled out of the event because he opposed the name change. “I did choose to cancel our Kennedy Center Christmas Eve Jazz Jam when I saw the name change happening last Friday,” Redd told in a statement. “I’ve been performing at the Kennedy Center since the beginning of my career and I was saddened to see this name change.” Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, complained in an email to the that artists who refuse to perform at the venue over political differences lacked principles. “Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn’t courageous or principled — they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,"" Daravi said. that he ""will not let"" artists cancel Kennedy Center shows ""without consequences.""

The center’s new, Trump-selected board of trustees voted last week to rename it, adding Trump's name before Kennedy's, but the move has already been challenged by Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. She filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming that an act of Congress is needed to officially change the center's name. Members of the Kennedy family — including the former president's niece, Maria Shriver, and former Democratic congressman Joe Kennedy — were critical of Trump tacking his own name onto their relative's memorial. “It is beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable,” Shriver It's not just musicians and Kennedy relatives who oppose Trump's meddling in the Kennedy Center.

Read our Barefoot children played on chilly sand as Gaza ’s thousands of displaced people prepared threadbare tents on Saturday for another round of winter rain. Some families in the central town of Deir al-Balah said they had been living in tents for about two years, or for most of the war between braced fraying tents with old pieces of wood or inspected the ragged edges of holes torn in tarps. Inside the dim homes, daylight through tiny holes shone like stars. Mothers battled the damp, slinging clothing over poles or cord to dry in the wind between the downpours that turn paths into puddles. One mother pulled a tiny child away from a mildewing patch of carpet. “We have been living in this tent for two years. Every time it rains and the tent collapses over our heads, we try to put up new pieces of wood,” said Shaima Wadi, a mother of four children who was displaced from Jabaliya in the north. “With how expensive everything has become, and without any income, we can barely afford clothes for our children or mattresses for them to sleep on.” Gaza’s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, has said dozens of people, including a two-week-old infant, have died from hypothermia or after weather-related collapses of war-damaged homes. Aid organizations have called for more shelters and other humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory. Emergency workers have warned people not to stay in damaged buildings. But with so much of the territory reduced to rubble, there are few places to escape the rain. “I collect nylon, cardboard and plastic from the streets to keep them warm,” said Ahmad Wadi, who burns the materials or uses them as a kind of blanket for loved ones. “They don’t have proper covers. It is freezing, the humidity is high, and water seeps in from everywhere.

Though the agreement has mostly held, its progress has slowed. The remains of the final hostage taken during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war are still in Gaza. Challenges in the next phase of the ceasefire include the deployment of an international stabilization force, a technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory. Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of truce violations. Gaza’s Health Ministry said that since the ceasefire went into effect, 414 Palestinians have been killed and 1,142 wounded. It said the bodies of 679 people were pulled from the rubble during the same period as the truce makes it safer to search for the remains of people killed earlier. The ministry on Saturday said 29 bodies, including 25 that were recovered from under the rubble, had been brought to local hospitals over the past 48 hours. The overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war has risen to at least 71,266, the ministry said, and another 171,219 have been wounded. The ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement Saturday that a military operation continued in a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank a day after police said a Palestinian attacker rammed his car into a man and then stabbed a young woman in northern Israel on Friday afternoon, killing both. The statement said the army had surrounded the town of Qabatiya, where Katz said the attacker was from, and was operating “forcefully” there. Authorities on Friday said the attacker was shot and injured in Afula. He was taken to a hospital. It’s common practice for Israel to launch raids in the West Bank towns that attackers come from or demolish homes belonging to the assailants’ families. Israel says that it helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevents future attacks. Rights watchdogs describe such actions as collective punishment. AP video on Saturday showed Israeli bulldozers entering the town and soldiers patrolling. “They announced a strict curfew,” resident Bilal Hanash said, as he and others described main roads being closed with dirt barriers, a practice that has grown during the war in Gaza. “So basically, they’re punishing 30,000 people.” Find more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.

Most of the figures are based on insured losses, which tend to be highest in wealthier countries with high property values and more widespread insurance coverage. in California caused more than $60bn (£47bn) in damage and were linked to more than 400 deaths, making them the single costliest disaster of the year. Asia, however, dominated the list overall. in November caused an estimated $25bn (£20bn) in damage and killed more than 1,750 people across Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Malaysia. Flooding in China caused $11.7bn (£9.2bn) in losses and killed at least 30 people, while and landslides across India and Pakistan killed more than 1,860 people and affected millions. Typhoons in the Philippines caused more than $5bn (£4bn) in damage and displaced over 1.4 million people. In many poorer countries, disasters with severe human consequences did not appear in global cost rankings at all. Flooding in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo killed hundreds of people, while a prolonged drought across Iran and West Asia has left up to 10 million people in Tehran facing the prospect of evacuation because of water shortages. “While wealthy nations count the financial cost of disasters, millions of people across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean are counting lost lives, homes and futures,” said Mohamed Adow, director of the Nairobi-based climate think tank Power Shift Africa. “These disasters are not ‘natural’ – they are the inevitable result of continued fossil fuel expansion and political delay,” said Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College London. “While the costs run into the billions, the heaviest burden falls on communities with the least resources to recover.” The findings come after the EU’s climate and space agency Copernicus said this month that 2025 is set to be the world's second or third-warmest on record, potentially surpassed only by 2024's record-breaking heat. According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the last 10 years have been the 10 warmest years since records began. At the same time, global emissions have continued to rise, driven largely by the burning of coal, oil and gas, even as renewable energy capacity has expanded rapidly.

Read our hunts gather under the shadow of a looming government crackdown. administration's intention to ban trail hunting, announced just days before these traditional events, has intensified existing tensions. This decision, alongside persistent resentment over inheritance tax changes despite a partial U-turn, has deepened discontent among farming communities. The Countryside Alliance pressure group contends the Government has ""alienated rural people"". A poll suggests 65 per cent of voters believe the Labour administration unfairly neglects country communities. The proposed ban on trail hunting – where hounds follow a laid scent – is part of the Government’s new animal welfare strategy, launched before Christmas. This measure addresses concerns that the practice is being used as a smokescreen for foxhunting. The Countryside Alliance defended the practice, introduced to comply with the Hunting Act 2004’s ban on pursuing foxes, and tens of thousands of people are expected to turn up at Boxing Day trail hunts. The group claimed hunts contribute more than £100 million a year to the rural economy. The Government will launch a consultation in early 2026 on how to ban trail hunting. Countryside Alliance chief executive Tim Bonner said: “When Keir Starmer said that he ‘wanted a new relationship with the countryside’ we all assumed he meant a better one, but in 18 months his government has alienated rural people and created the clear impression that it does not care about the countryside. “Its warped priorities have put taxing family farms, raising rates for rural businesses and banning trail hunting above policies that would benefit rural people. “While the partial changes to the family farm tax are a step in the right direction, the government must desperately learn the fundamental lesson of this policy debacle, which is that it needs to work with the rural community – not legislate against it. “The government has a very long way to go to rebuild trust.” A poll by ORB International suggested only 36 per cent of Britons agreed or strongly agreed the Labour government cares about people who live in the countryside, while 76 per cent said they believed the Government prioritised urban issues over rural ones. ORB surveyed 2,083 British adults online between December 12 and 14. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) defended its policies, pointing to its response to a review of the agricultural sector carried out by former National Farmers’ Union president Baroness Minette Batters. A Defra spokeswoman said: “This government is committed to banning trail hunting, which is too often used as a cover for illegal fox hunting, and has strong public support across the country. “This builds on previous animal welfare reforms delivered by this Government, including giving police greater powers to prevent dog attacks on livestock, protecting farmers and animals alike. “The Batters Review highlighted the need for greater collaboration between industry, farmers and government — and that is exactly what we will do. “We have increased the individual inheritance tax threshold from £1 million to £2.5 million, meaning couples with estates of up to £5 million will pay no inheritance tax.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Telluride, one of the best-known ski resorts in the Western U.S., plans to close in the coming days due to a labor dispute between its owner and the ski patrol union. The Telluride Professional Ski Patrol Association voted Tuesday to strike Saturday after contract negotiations since June failed to yield an agreement on pay. With no more talks planned before the weekend, Telluride Ski Resort said it will not open that day. “We are concerned that any organization, particularly one that exists to help people, would do something that will have such a devastating effect on our community,” owner Chuck Horning said Wednesday in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether the closure will last longer. Resort officials were working on a plan to reopen even if the strike continues, according to the statement. The patrollers are seeking to be paid more in line with their counterparts at other resorts in the region. The union wants starting pay to rise from $21 to $28 per hour, and for wages for patrollers with more than 30 years of experience to increase from $30-$36 per hour to $39-$48.60 per hour. While resort officials sought to lay blame for the impending closure on the union, Andy Dennis, interim safety director and spokesperson for patrollers’ association, said it lies with Horning. “He’s being a bully. This is what bullies do, take their toys and run,” Dennis said. “All he has to do is give us a fair contract, and this would all be over.” Ski patrollers sometimes argue for more pay on the grounds that the cost of living is high in ski towns and they are responsible for people's safety. Patrollers' duties include attending to injured skiers and the controlled release of avalanches with explosives when nobody is in range. Even without a strike, Telluride has yet to get going fully this season, with unusually warm weather meaning just 20 of the resort's 149 trails have been able to open. Patrollers around the Rocky Mountain region have been voting on unionizing recently. Last year an almost two-week strike closed many runs and caused long lift lines at 's Park City Mountain Resort. That strike ended when Colorado-based Vail Resorts acceded to demands including a $2-an-hour base pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Bolivia’s new government on Tuesday issued a decree that will allow global satellite internet companies such as Starlink or Kuiper to provide internet access across the Andean nation as it tries to upgrade its technology and speed up its notoriously slow connectivity rates. Bolivia’s centrist President Rodrigo Paz signed the decree, which waives the restrictions placed on international satellite companies by the socialist administration of his predecessor, Luis Arce. Last year, Arce’s government refused to grant a license to , which owns Starlink, to operate in Bolivia, citing data protection and national sovereignty concerns. For years, Bolivia has tried to improve internet access in remote areas with a satellite purchased from China during the government of left-wing leader . When the satellite was acquired in 2013, Morales promised it would “enlighten the people, after years of living in obscurity."" However, the Chinese satellite, known as the Tupac Katari, failed to significantly speed up internet connections on mobile phones or in homes, because it relies on geostationary technology and orbits at a distance of about 35,000 kilometers (about 21,800 miles) from the surface. In contrast, satellites used by Starlink orbit the planet at a distance of 550 kilometers (some 340 miles). Modern satellites used by Starlink and its competitors stay closer to Earth, which enables them to transmit data at faster rates. A report published in November by Ookla, a connectivity intelligence company, found that Bolivia had the slowest internet speed for mobile phones and fixed broadband in South America. On Tuesday, the Bolivian president said that by granting licenses to international satellite companies, he is hoping to “reduce the digital divide” and guarantee access to high quality connectivity for Bolivians. The slow connectivity rates in Bolivia stymie simple tasks such as conference calls, and also make it harder to conduct more complex operations online, including cloud computing. “We became spectators while the rest of the world advanced,” said Paz, who was elected in October. “But that is over. With new technologies we will be able to make up for lost time.” Paz also said international companies — including Tesla, Amazon, Tether and Orcacle — plan to invest in data centers that Bolivia will set up near the cities of El Alto and Cochambamba. The president has been trying to draw international investment to Bolivia, as part of an effort to overcome an economic crisis, characterized by severe shortages of U.S. dollars. Earlier this week, Paz signed a decree to eliminate fuel subsidies that had hobbled public finances and worsened the dollar shortages. Labor unions across the Andean nation took to the streets on Monday to protest the elimination of the fuel subsidies.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our guard Terry Rozier ’s lawyers are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season, arguing that the government overreached by turning a private dispute over bettors’ use of non-public information into a federal case. In a motion to dismiss made public on Tuesday, Rozier’s lawyers argued that the government’s theory of the case — that he prevented sportsbooks from making informed decisions about accepting certain bets — runs afoul of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the federal wire fraud statute. Rozier, 31, is accused of helped gamblers cash in by tipping off a friend that he would leave a March 2023 game early because of a supposed injury. The friend, Deniro “Niro” Laster, who is also charged, shared or sold the information to others, who placed more than $250,000 in prop bets, prosecutors said. “The government has billed this case as involving ‘insider betting’ and ‘rigging’ professional basketball games,"" Rozier’s lawyers, James M. Trusty and A. Jeff Ifrah, wrote in the motion. ""But the indictment alleges something less headline-worthy: that some bettors broke certain sportsbooks’ terms of use against wagering based on non-public information and ‘straw betting.'"" Hornets at the time and the information about his early exit was not listed on the team’s injury report, nor was it shared with the public or the sportsbooks that accept wagers on Rozier pleaded not guilty in federal court in on Dec. 8 to wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges. He was released on $3 million bond and is due back in court for a hearing before U.S. District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall on March 3. His charges were part of a sweep of more than 30 other people in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations: one that authorities said leaked inside information about NBA athletes and another involving rigged, Mafia-backed poker games. The charges have raised questions about the integrity of NBA games in an era of legalized betting and myriad prop bets, prompting the league to tweak its injury reporting requirements. A message seeking comment on Rozier’s motion to dismiss the case was left for federal prosecutors. In the motion, Rozier’s lawyers wrote that under the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in United States v. Ciminelli, prosecutors can't make a wire fraud case out of allegations that defendants conspired to deprive a person — or, in this case, sportsbooks — of the right to information needed to make discretionary economic decisions. They also questioned whether federal prosecutors have the authority to bring such a case, since sportsbooks are regulated at the state level, not the federal level. “This is not to say that sports betting platforms are without recourse when their terms of use are violated — they can void bets, pursue civil remedies, or seek state prosecutor involvement,” Trusty and Ifrah wrote in the motion, which was dated Dec. 12 but only posted to the case docket on Tuesday. ""But Ciminelli puts to rest the notion that federal prosecutors are here to enforce contractual agreements between bettors and platforms."" Rozier has earned about $160 million over a 10-year NBA career. He was a first-round pick for the Boston Celtics in 2015 after starring at the University of Louisville. Charlotte traded him to the Heat last year. In the game in question, Rozier played the first nine minutes and 36 seconds against the New Orleans Pelicans before leaving, citing a foot issue. He did not play again that season. Rozier’s lawyers noted that the indictment does not allege that he ever placed a bet on any NBA game, nor does it allege that he knew Laster intended to sell his tip to others or that using it to place wagers would violate the sportsbooks’ terms of service. And, they said, he really was injured. “The government’s cynicism as to whether Mr. Rozier was injured is belied by a variety of witnesses and medical professionals who were aware of Rozier’s injury, in many cases before the Pelicans game,” Trusty and Ifrah wrote.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our The American Dream typically includes a home with a white picket fence, but what happens when younger generations can only afford the fence? found the millennial generation is giving up on the thought of ever with experts estimating fewer will live out the American Dream of becoming homeowners. Economists Seung Hyeong Lee of Northwestern University and Younggeun Yoo of the University of Chicago recently published a paper looking at of Americans born in the 1990s and how their attitudes toward homeownership may affect their behavior. Lee and Yoo estimate just about 74 percent of people born in 1990 will become homeowners by retirement, a 9.6 percent decline from the nearly 84 percent of people born in 1950 who have bought a house. Millennials range in age from 29 to 44 years old and were born between 1981 and 1996, but this study focuses on those born in the 1990s. About 15 percent of the U.S. population has already given up on homeownership by the age of 30, the researchers found. in November was $433,275, which is up 0.7 percent compared to last year, according to real estate brokerage . The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as of last Thursday was 6.21 percent, down from 6.72 percent at the same time last year, according to mortgage buyer Lee and Yoo’s paper, fittingly called “Giving Up,” found that as the belief in being able to buy a house falls, respondents consume more relative to their wealth, put less effort into their jobs and make riskier investments. But just because millennials may be spending more, it doesn’t mean it’s all going toward avocado toast, something Australian real estate mogul Tim Gurner suggested in 2017. Stefanie DeLuca, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, said in a article about Lee and Yoo’s paper, “If you’re not saving and deferring to buy a house, you’re spending it on other kinds of enrichment activities for your kids, supporting folks in your family who are going through a tough time.” In their paper, Lee and Yoo propose the implementation of a subsidy “that focuses on households near the margin of giving up on homeownership.” There are already thousands of government assistance programs to help people struggling to afford buying a home, according to Down Payment Resource CEO Rob Chrane. “I don’t think we need more programs. I think we need a better job of communicating the programs,” he told Moody’s economist Cristian deRitis warned of a bigger problem at hand — there are not enough homes to go around. “By our calculation, we need to add 2 million housing units to the economy,” the expert told the publication.

Read our on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people. The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone’s gender expression doesn’t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final. Tuesday’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited. “Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors’ offices,” , who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday. The lawsuit alleges that HHS’s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy — neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued. HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria. The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility. Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people. The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers — and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide. HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules — one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures. The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children. Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Trump returned to office — even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law. Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court’s recent decision upholding Tennessee’s ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia.

In welcome news, inflation dropped sharply to 3.2 per cent in November, down from 3.6, helped largely by the falling cost of clothing and food. But this does just mean that prices are rising less quickly – not falling – and they remain persistently high in the face of stagnant wages. At the same time, exorbitant household bills mean millions are grappling with debts to afford the essentials. because they cannot afford it, recent research by the Trussell Trust found.

These include: However, there is one key bank holiday to be aware of: 1 January (New Years’ Day). Anyone due to receive a payment on this day should instead receive it on Wednesday 31 December (New Year’s Eve). There are some similar changes around Christmas. Anyone due a payment on Thursday 25 December (Christmas Day) should instead receive it on Wednesday 24 December (Christmas Eve). Likewise, anyone due a payment on Friday 26 December (Boxing Day) should also receive it on Christmas Eve. For more information on how and when state benefits are paid, The DWP is aiming to complete the migration of all “legacy benefits” to universal credit by January 2026. Those receiving tax credits, income support, jobseeker’s allowance, and housing benefit should have received a notice about moving to universal credit already. The basic state pension is paid straight into bank accounts, similarly to how benefits are paid. It is usually paid every four weeks, with the exact day you receive it corresponding to the last two digits of your national insurance (NI) number. Here’s when you should be paid based on those numbers: The same bank holiday payment date changes that apply to most benefits will also apply to state pension payments. In April 2026, all universal credit claimants will receive an above-inflation income boost of around 6.2 per cent to the standard allowance. For a single person over 25, this will be a £6 per week increase, rising from £92 to £98. For couples with one or both partner over 25, it will be an increase of £9 per week, rising from £145 to £154. should be uprated by September’s inflation rate alone, increasing by 3.8 per cent.

The rate for existing claimants will also be frozen until 2029. This is a reduction of over £200 a month, cutting the additional rate by around half.

This will bring the weekly amount to £241.05. For more information about the new benefit rates, The government offers a “budgeting advance loan” for people on universal credit who face an emergency lack of money. The loan has a maximum repayment period of two years. These loans are interest-free and are automatically deducted from universal credit payments. You can borrow an “advance” of up to: Following Labour’s 2024 Budget, a new cap was introduced on the amount the DWP can deduct from benefit payments to repay loans and debts, including budgeting advance loans. Beginning in April 2025, deductions from universal credit have been capped at 15 per cent of the standard allowance, down from 25 per cent. Households can apply to their council for a discretionary housing payment (DHP), which offers financial support to go towards rent or housing costs. You can only get a DHP if you are in receipt of housing benefit or the housing element of universal credit. It can cover housing costs for a rent shortfall, rent deposits and rent in advance if you need to move home. Exact eligibility and the funds available are decided on a council-by-council basis, so you will need to get in touch with your local authority to find out more. The household support fund (HSF), distributed by local councils, offers vital assistance to those facing financial hardship, complementing standard benefits and grants. As part of this government initiative, eligible households throughout the UK can access support such as essential appliances, contributions towards utility bills, and direct cash payments reaching up to £300. Local authorities are free to decide how to allocate their HSF funding to suit households in their area, so exactly what is available will vary. To apply, households need to contact their council (most offer an online form). This nationwide programme is set to run until March 2026. The government has committed £1bn in funding to transition it into a “Crisis and Resilience Fund” which will replace the DHP. If you are struggling financially, you may be eligible for certain charitable grants. There is a wide range of grants available depending on your circumstances.

To find out what support your water company offers, it is worth checking on its website or contacting the helpline. In all cases, households will need to be deemed to be on a low income and/or in receipt of certain benefits. Similarly, many broadband providers offer social tariffs to those on certain benefits like universal credit or pension credit. If you meet certain criteria or are on certain benefits, you may be able to apply for a discount on your council tax of up to 100 per cent (this is sometimes called council tax support). Your local council may still be able to offer you a discretionary reduction if you can demonstrate you are facing severe hardship and can’t afford to pay your council tax.

This concludes a gradual set of expansions that began in April 2024. Parents must apply online and reconfirm their eligibility every three months, in time for each school term. Working parents can also apply for tax-free childcare, giving back 20p for every 80p you put towards childcare, up to a maximum of £500 a year. Ofgem’s energy price cap rose by two per cent in October, from £1,720 to £1,755. The £35 rise comes after a more sizeable seven per cent decrease for July to September, from £1,849 to £1,720. For 1 January to 31 March 2026, it will go up to £1,758, Ofgem has confirmed – an increase of 0.2 per cent. The energy price cap is the maximum amount energy suppliers can charge you for each unit of energy if you’re on a standard variable tariff. That includes most households. It is expressed as an annual bill for an average home. Many experts – including Ofgem itself – are recommending households consider a fixed tariff energy deal, with many on the market offering lower than the price cap rate.

In one email, Maxwell, who was jailed for 20 years for her role in sex-trafficking Epstein’s victims, asked an acquaintance to introduce “Andrew” to “friendly and discreet and fun” friends and to “some 2 legged sight seeing”. The email added: “He does not want to read about any trip in the papers [describing] whom or what he saw.” In the latest document release, an email in August 2001 from “A” with the address “The Invisible Man” reads: “I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.” The writer claims to be “totally exhausted”, and asks Maxwell how she is. They add: “How’s LA? Have you found me some new inappropriate friends? Let me know when you are coming over as I am free from 25th August until 2nd Sept and want to go somewhere hot and sunny with some fun people before having to put my nose firmly to the grindstone for the Fall.” The email concludes: “Any ideas gratefully received! See ya A xxx” In response, Maxwell wrote: “So sorry to disappoint you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.” The individual “A” responded “Distraught!” and wrote that they had just lost their valet, who had been with them since they were two years old. “I am a little off balance as not only has my office been restructured, I have left the RN and now my whole life is in turmoil as I have no one to look after me,” they wrote. In March 2002, Maxwell forwarded another email. “I just gave Andrew your telephone no. He is interested in seeing the Nazca Lines,” she wrote, apparently referring to the archaeological site in southern Peru. “He can ride but it is not his favorite sport ie pass on the horses.” She added: “Some sight seeing some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy. I know I can rely on you to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun.” In another, the sender “A” said they would leave “the girls” to Maxwell and another individual, in response to an email in which the sender suggested they would try to find some. The latest Epstein documents shed further light on the extent of Epstein’s relationship with the royal family, and come after the former Prince Andrew was stripped of his title over his friendship with the late financier. In separate documents released last week, the then Prince Andrew was shown in photographs introducing Epstein to members of British high society, with one image showing the royal reclining across the legs of several people with his head near to one woman’s lap. The picture was reportedly taken at Sandringham, the King’s private estate in Norfolk, where the former prince will move to from Windsor in the new year. The former prince has always strongly denied any wrongdoing, and said in October: “As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.” Buckingham Palace and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor have been contacted for comment. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor stepped down from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous interview, but the recent publication of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir and the US government’s ongoing release of documents from Epstein’s estate have prompted further scrutiny of his relationship with the financier. It led to the King officially stripping his disgraced brother of both his HRH style and his prince title.

Read our has filed a lengthy appeal brief, arguing that the music mogul’s conviction and sentencing on prostitution-related charges were unjust. following an eight-week trial in New York earlier this year. Combs — who is now serving out his sentence at a low-security New Jersey prison — was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. The court heard weeks of testimony from Combs’s ex-girlfriends and former associates who detailed alleged abuse. Several witnesses also described Combs’s drug-fueled sex marathons, referred to as “freak-offs” or “hotel nights.” Combs’s attorneys have maintained that the sexual encounters described in the case were consensual. Now, Combs’s lawyers argue the court was “unjust” and heavily relied on “acquitted conduct” when he was sentenced. His legal team accused Judge Arun Subramanian of acting as a “thirteenth juror” when he sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. “He sits in prison today, serving a 50-month sentence, because the district judge acted as a thirteenth juror. The judge defied the jury’s verdict and found Combs ‘coerced,’ ‘exploited,’ and ‘forced’ his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy,” his attorneys wrote in an 84-page document filed Tuesday. Combs’s legal team also noted that he was convicted of “two lesser counts—prostitution offenses that didn’t require force, fraud, or coercion.” “Defendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses—even when coercion, which the jury didn’t find here, is involved,” the filing reads. Subramanian cited the alleged abuse described by witnesses before he sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. “A history of good works can't wash away the record in this case. You abused these women. You used that abuse to get your way, freak-offs and hotel nights,” Subramanian said during the October sentencing hearing. “The evidence of the abuse is massive. The drugs may have exacerbated your erratic and violent behavior over the years. However, the court has to consider all of your history here,” he added. In Tuesday’s filing, Combs’s team argue that his conviction should be reversed because he did not engage in prostitution. “Properly construed, paying for a voyeuristic experience—which is what Combs was convicted of doing—is not engaging in ‘prostitution,’” his lawyers wrote. They also argue that Combs’s “freak-offs and hotel nights” were protected by the First Amendment. “Second, freak-offs and hotel nights were highly choreographed sexual performances involving the use of costumes, role play, and staged lighting, which were filmed so Combs and his girlfriends could watch this amateur pornography later,” his lawyers wrote. “Pornography production and viewing of this sort is protected by the First Amendment and thus cannot constitutionally be prosecuted,” they added.

Read our drawing could add new meaning to holiday cheer as millions of players hope to cash in on the $1.7 billion prize, which comes after months without a jackpot winner. ' 4th-largest jackpot on record comes after 46 consecutive draws without someone claiming to have all six numbers. The last contest with a jackpot winner was on Sept. 6. The game’s long odds have people decking the halls and doling out $2 — and sometimes more — for tickets ahead of Wednesday night's live drawing. It's a sign the game is operating as intended. officials made the odds tougher in 2015 as a mechanism for snowballing jackpots, all the while making it easier to win smaller prizes. The Christmas holiday is not expected to impact the drawing process should there be a winning ticket, a Powerball spokesperson said. Here is what to know about Wednesday’s drawing: That ticket placed in a stocking or under the tree could be worth a billion bucks — but with some caveats. Powerball is played in 45 states, along with Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Most of those areas require players to be 18 or older, though some states have steeper requirements. In Nebraska, players have to be at least 19 years old, and in Louisiana and Arizona, people can't buy tickets until they are 21. Winning tickets also must be cashed in the states where they were bought. And players can't buy tickets in Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada or Utah. Other than that, lottery officials argue there is a chance a lucky Powerball ticket could be a gift that keeps on giving. Charlie McIntyre, the New Hampshire Lottery's executive director, said Tuesday: “Just think of the stories you can tell for generations to come about the year you woke up a billionaire on Christmas.” Wednesday's $1.7 billion jackpot has a cash value of $781.3 million. A winner can choose to be paid the whole amount through an annuity, with an immediate payment and then annual payments over 29 years that increase by 5% each time. Most winners, however, usually choose the cash value for a lump sum. The odds are high for the top prize, but there are smaller prizes players can reap. At the last drawing, players in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin each won $1 million. There are also prizes outside the jackpot, ranging from a few dollars to $2 million. One woman told Powerball officials that she already made plans for her $1 million win: “We’re going to pay off our cars and credit cards and get a bigger house!” , said he intended to use his $100,000 Powerball win from earlier this month to go back to school, according to Powerball. Lottery officials set the odds at 1 in 292.2 million in hopes that jackpots will roll over with each of the three weekly drawings until the pool balloons so much that more people take notice and play. The odds used to be notably better, at 1 in 175 million. But the game was made tougher in 2015 to create the out-of-this-world bounties. The tougher odds partly helped set the stage for back-to-back record-breaking sweepstakes this year. The last time someone won the Powerball pot was on Sept. 6, when players in Missouri and Texas won $1.787 billion, which was the second-highest top prize in U.S. history. The U.S. has seen more than a dozen lottery jackpot prizes exceed $1 billion since 2016. The biggest U.S. jackpot ever was $2.04 billion back in 2022. It’s hard to explain what odds of 1 in 292.2 million mean. Even if halved, they remain difficult to digest. In the past, one math professor described the odds of flipping a coin and getting heads 28 straight times. Tim Chartier, a Davidson College math professor in North Carolina, on Monday compared the odds of a winning lottery ticket to selecting one marked dollar bill from a stack 19 miles (31 kilometers) high. “It’s true that if you buy 100 tickets, you are 100 times more likely to win. But in this case, ‘100 times more likely’ barely moves the probability needle,” Chartier said. “Using the time analogy, buying 100 tickets is like getting 100 guesses to name that one chosen second over nine years. Possible — but wildly improbable.” Olivia Diaz is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Read our A baby boy who has spent the vast majority of his young life in hospital is finally preparing to celebrate his first Christmas at home after being discharged. Bertie Melly, born prematurely at just 24 weeks in May 2024, weighed a mere 1lb 10oz and has endured more than 500 days in medical care. Bertie's challenging start included five operations following a diagnosis of necrotising enterocolitis, a serious condition affecting the intestines. Now, after 547 days, he is home in Bromley with his parents, Phoebe and Callum Melly, who affectionately describe their son as a ""remarkable little human being."" The family is eagerly anticipating spending the festive season with loved ones. Born after a swift 17-minute labour at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, Bertie's first surgery on his bowel occurred at just 10 days old. He spent his initial six months in neonatal intensive care before being transferred to Evelina London Children’s Hospital, where his parents stayed at the nearby Ronald McDonald House to remain close. The Evelina’s neonatal team notes that the average NICU stay for a 24-week premature baby is typically around six months, highlighting Bertie's extended journey. Despite the immense challenges, Bertie's father, Callum Melly, 37, shared with the Press Association that his son is the ""happiest child you will ever meet."" He elaborated: ""Considering everything he’s been through – if you see his hands, his hands are covered in scars from the amount of cannulas he’s had, he’s got gaping scars all over his his abdomen – and he wakes up beaming, goes to bed, beaming. He’s a remarkable little human being."" Bertie’s mother, Phoebe Melly, 34, attributes her son’s joyful disposition to the ""love and affection"" he received from the dedicated medical staff. She told PA: ""In the NICU and in the paediatric ward at the Evelina, everyone just loved him and genuinely really cared for him, which was so nice, and I think that’s really helped him to get to where he is today."" Since his discharge in November, Bertie is ""thriving,"" according to Mrs Melly. She noted his rapid physical development: ""He’s physically developing really well, I think he’s not that far off walking now. He’s climbing up the stairs, on and off the sofa, and getting a bit more confident with his standing."" Mr Melly added that being home feels ""so normal"" and that the hospital stay is ""almost a distant memory now,"" despite only being home for four weeks. The family has already taken Bertie to meet Father Christmas, though Mrs Melly joked he was ""more interested in all the decorations."" She is particularly looking forward to buying him presents this year, a luxury limited by hospital space. Medically, Bertie is ""making some really good progress,"" though Mrs Melly acknowledged ""there is always a risk that he could get a bowel obstruction"" later in life, though it is not a certainty. Following his operations, Bertie lives with a ""short gut,"" having lost approximately 70 per cent of his small intestine. He is currently tube-fed milk and receives essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids directly into his bloodstream via an IV line. The family's immediate goal is to increase his intake of solid foods, aiming to eventually wean him off both lines. Mr Melly hopes the IV nutrition line, which goes straight to Bertie’s heart, can be removed within six months to a year. ""If he can get that line out, then it means we can have a pretty much normal life until he’s eating enough to get the milk pump removed as well,"" he explained. Recalling the initial stages, Mrs Melly described being ""very relaxed"" when she went to hospital in May 2024 with bleeding, as an assessment indicated a low risk of immediate birth. She was told she might stay for a week of bed rest before returning home. ""We didn’t know what was ahead, and I actually think that was probably a good thing, because we literally just took each day as it came,"" she reflected. ""We didn’t think too far ahead. We tackled one problem at a time."" Bertie’s ""biggest"" health issue at birth was his bowel, but the family also ""went through a lot"" with his breathing. Mrs Melly recounted: ""He was intubated for a long time, and there was times when his lungs were fully about to give up."" She added: ""You just can’t think too far ahead – there were times I wouldn’t have even thought we’d be sat here today, and we’re at home with him. “So in that sense, it’s comforting to know that, although you’ve got those dark fears, actually, we’ve made so much progress in 18 months, so who knows where we’ll be in a year’s time as well."" The couple expressed their ""eternal gratitude"" to the Evelina team for their unwavering support. Mr Melly emphasised: ""They saved his life at the end of the day, on countless occasions."" Iain Yardley, a consultant paediatric and neonatal surgeon at Evelina London involved in Bertie’s care, praised the family: ""Bertie has faced many, many challenges in his short life. “He and his parents have faced these challenges with extraordinary grace and courage. Seeing him go home is what we all have been working for and we could not be more pleased for him and his family.""",The Independent,The Independent

Authorities said the millions of people expected to travel across the state will likely meet hazardous, if not impossible, conditions as several atmospheric rivers were forecast to make their way through the state, the “If you’re planning to be on the roads for the Christmas holidays, please reconsider your plans,” said Ariel Cohen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned about flash flooding, mudslides and debris flows in areas scorched by last January's wildfires. officials said they were knocking on the doors of some 380 particularly vulnerable households to order them to leave. Much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area were under a flood watch and a high wind warning through Friday. Forecasters warned heavy snow and gusts were expected to create “near white-out conditions” Wednesday in parts of the Sierra Nevada and make it “nearly impossible” to travel through the mountain passes. There's also a risk of severe thunderstorms and a small chance of tornadoes along the northern coast. Heavy rain and flash flooding already led to water rescues and at least one death in Northern California, local officials said. Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson on Monday declared a state of emergency to prepare for more rain and allow the state to help with hazard mitigation and search and rescue operations. Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. It could be even more in the mountains. Gusts could reach 60 to 80 mph (96.5 to 127.8 kph) in parts of the central coast. Officials expect multiple road closures and airport delays during the storms. Downed trees and power lines are also possible. Parts of Los Angeles are under evacuation warnings this week. The county put up K-rails, a type of barrier, around the burn scar to help catch sliding debris during rainstorms. Residents could also pick up free sandbags to protect their homes, said Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles County supervisor representing Altadena. Many people in burn scar areas decided not to leave after receiving the evacuation notification, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said. He urged them to reconsider. “The threat posed by this storm is real and imminent,” he said. Local and state officials are gearing up to respond to emergencies through the week. The state has deployed resources and first responders to a number of counties along the coast and in Southern California. The California National Guard is also on standby to assist.

Read our A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona. Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family’s tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband. An attorney for Michael Abatti didn’t immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment. on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death. El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers. His father, , helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups. Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010. Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children. Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles (305 kilometers) northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri’s forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name. The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death. The Abattis were sparring over finances with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said. After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn’t maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple’s three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings show. “I am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,” she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles (450,600 kilometers) on it and sorely needed repairs. Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn’t afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter. He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700, and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full. “The income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,” Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti’s family law attorney, wrote in court papers. Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show. He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled “The Morality of Deceit.” In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",The Independent,The Independent

I have wondered for most of my I was brought up in a Jewish home in east London. We weren’t much fussed about religious observance or about Israel, and once or twice at this time of year, we had a Christmas tree alongside a Chanukah menorah. At my happy little primary school, there were a few Jewish kids, and nothing was made of it. But soon it would be. Aged 11, I won a scholarship to a fancy school, Bancroft’s, a bus ride away in a better area. It was a minor public school, with about a quarter of the boys boarders from all over London and beyond, the rest of us more local day boys. Bancroft’s was on a par with Dulwich College in south London, with whom we played rugby. So while my best-known near-contemporaries are the likes of the lawyer Lord David Pannick, Mike Lynch, the late tech billionaire, and the comedian Alan Davies (who loathed the school); over at Dulwich, their star turns are the novelist Michael Ondaatje, the comedian Richard Ayoade and the UK’s probable next prime minister, Nigel Farage. From day one at Bancroft’s, I discovered something wholly new. In my little neighbourhood, being Jewish was no big deal. But transferred to this bigger school in a fancier catchment, it suddenly was. Suddenly, a small core of my schoolmates were obsessed with “Yids” and “Jew boys”. We were only a handful, but this snarling bunch couldn’t pass any of us in the corridor without rubbing their noses, putting on Fagin-like voices and muttering about Hitler having had the right idea. The amusing ruse of hissing to signify gas chambers, of which there has been much in the news recently, had not quite yet caught on. Our tormentors would throw down pennies and joke about us using our apparently oversized noses to pick them up. Jews were somehow accused of being miserly and extravagant at the same time – a simplified version of the antisemites’ complaint about the Jews for a century, that we are apparently both communists and capitalists simultaneously. I was twice physically beaten up for walking around while Jewish, but there was one tormentor who was never violent, but was incredibly persistent. He was called Johnnie Dickens, a big, tough boarder, a scholarship boy like me, who had a kind face and was very funny – other than when he broke off to have yet another tedious go at the Jew boys. I avoided Dickens and barely saw him, but I have wondered about him a lot over the subsequent decades. He came from the east end of London and his father had reputedly been a docker. I speculated that perhaps his dad had been a follower of Oswald Mosley, the pre-war British fascist leader. A lot of old dockers had been in Mosley’s gang. I had no idea what had become of Johnnie Dickens. Pals told me he softened and became a rather nice young bloke. Decades later, when Facebook started, I was amused to find he was a clearly much-loved headteacher at a junior school in Hampshire. That was a surprise. However, with accusations of Farage being an antisemitic bully at school dominating the headlines – allegations he has denied – my curiosity about Johnnie Dickens was suddenly piqued again. I tracked him down online and sent a message. If he ignored me, or sent back an insulting reply, I would have an answer of sorts. He didn’t respond. But then I found a phone number for him, and after procrastinating over it for days, I rang him. Dickens’ response was one of the most extraordinary – and heartening – things I can remember in 45 years as a journalist. He hadn’t seen my message, so I explained again why I was contacting him, and asked if I could buy him lunch and have a chat for an article I had long wanted to write about my experiences at school. I would promise him total anonymity. “No,” he said, “I don’t want to be anonymous. I want to come right out, publicly and say how embarrassed and ashamed I am about how I was back then; how regretful I am about the stupid, vicious things I used to say.” This kind of thing never happens. People, many of them in the public eye, never take responsibility for anything that’s inconvenient or embarrassing to them. Dickens could have said it was all “banter” from a long time ago and he didn’t remember it, but instead, here was a prominent citizen in his area – he’s still a supply teacher and a popular funeral celebrant locally – being what in Yiddish, I’d call a So, why did he say such vile things? “My only excuse is that I was a totally ignorant little d***, but I was also old enough to know better. I had no hatred whatsoever in my heart, and I was basically doing it to look cool to other people. I’m extremely sorry, and please do come over any time you like. Even just speaking on the phone like this is very cathartic.” I was completely taken aback, and expected him to change his mind, and I would have understood if he had. But he didn’t, and a week ago, I met Johnnie Dickens in a pub by Swindon station. A grandfather now, like me, he was a thoroughly delightful, gentle and thoughtful guy. “I really was a little sh**, wasn’t I?” he said. His father, Fred, had, indeed, been a docker, then a lorry driver. They had lived in a council house in the East End, but he’s from a background of solid, if currently disappointed, Labour voters. His family disliked Enoch Powell, and today, he particularly despises politicians weaponising the small boats issue to gain power. In the course of a blokey two hours in the pub, he quoted Robert Frost, Shakespeare, Laurie Lee and Virgil. And explained how brutal life as a public school boarder in the 1960s had been. (I should say that the school now is very different – highly multicultural and academically outstanding). I realise now that the real Johnnie Dickens as a boy was not even remotely an antisemite “I felt physically sick often because of the unfairness of it all,” he admitted. “It was very much the older ones picking on the younger ones, a pecking order thing. There was no support. You couldn’t say a word to the masters because you would get your head kicked in by the boys. “I might have been big, but I would cry incessantly when I first went to Bancroft’s because I’m quite a softie. I still cry when there’s a lovely song in a film.” Dickens explained how when we were 16, long after I’d begun shunning him, he’d been taken during a school trip to Belsen concentration camp, and it changed his life and his outlook. “One thing I will admit,” he said, laughing. “I was jealous of you guys having barmitzvahs. Nobody gave me a load of Parker pens when I was 13. I couldn’t understand how you all suddenly got all this expensive stuff.” Charitable, well-travelled and cultured, this Johnnie Dickens v2.0 was a revelation. He goes into villages in Gambia to help people out with things like football kit they can’t afford. He is not religious, he says, but sometimes prays and adds: “I’d love to go to a synagogue some time.” As a successful teacher – Dickens became a head at 32 – he is appalled that when we were growing up, the school had no comparative religion classes. “If someone had explained to me the differences and commonalities between Christians, Jews, Muslims, it could have made all the difference.” It’s an interesting point. In spite of the horrors of the Manchester synagogue attack and the Bondi massacre, I’m not one of those who believe there’s an unstoppable flood of Jew hatred. What I do see is a massive amount of ignorance, especially among Gen-Zers, that has made a dislike of Jews this year’s fashionable look. Legitimate protest against a nasty strain of crude and shameful nationalism among some Israelis has been exploited across the world by a small but virulent number of true Jew haters, with a truly genocidal agenda. We see it time and again – young people, often at good universities, who chant “from the river to the sea” and “globalise the intifada” while knowing as much about what those slogans mean as my cat. I realise now that the real Johnnie Dickens as a boy was not even remotely an antisemite – just a clever young lad led astray in a demanding new school environment and showing off to gain status. How refreshing for him to admit as much, and if only people in public life were as upfront about their past behaviour too and apologise for it instead of dismissing it as banter from a different age, or, even worse, denying it had happened in the first place. To be upfront and explain doesn’t make someone look shady or weak. If anything, it can be something to be admired. Corny as it is on Christmas Eve in a troubled year to proclaim peace and brotherhood among men, the real Johnnie Dickens is welcome at our house any time. We may even try to rustle up a traditional Friday night dinner to honour him and his inspirational honesty.",The Independent,The Independent

However, while temperatures are predicted to fall to as low as 2C in the south west and Scotland, forecasters have warned there are “currently no strong signals for significant or widespread ” - meaning a white Christmas is unlikely for most. Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly, said: “After a spell of unsettled and wet , we’re expecting a gradual shift to more settled conditions as high pressure builds into next week. “This will bring drier and colder weather for many over the Christmas period, with the risk of overnight frost and fog where skies clear.” He added while there is a good chance of showers, these are unlikely to turn to snow. “While there will likely be some showers, more especially in eastern and southern areas, these perhaps wintry over higher ground, there are currently no strong signals for significant or widespread snowfall,” he said. “As always, we advise everyone to keep up to date with the latest Met Office forecasts and warnings, especially if you’re making plans over the festive period.” Weather maps show temperatures remaining mild at around 10C on Monday before dropping slightly to 8C on Tuesday. Forecasters are predicting a sharp drop to around 5C on Christmas Eve, with the mercury falling further to 3C on Christmas Day. This is a colder Christmas than the UK has seen in recent years. But forecasters said any winter flurries are likely to be limited to the south coast of England. Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna said: “By Christmas Day, (temperatures will be) no better than 5 to 7C across the UK, so quite a drop from what we’ve seen of late, and feeling cold in that wind, as well. “On Christmas Day, we need to keep an eye on the far south of the UK, particularly the south coast of England. There’s just a chance we could see one or two wintry flurries developing. “There’s only a 10 per cent chance of anything significant developing there, but all we need, of course, is for a flake of snow to fall anywhere across the UK for it to technically be termed a ‘white Christmas’, so something to keep an eye on across the far south of England.” Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to see outbreaks of rain, which will slowly ease into this afternoon.

Read our Turkey, chocolate and sparkling wine - all things many Britons are sure to be indulging in over the festive period. and indigestion risks getting in the way of Christmas cheer, with GP Dr Hilary Jones saying there is a hit on the website every 13 seconds on 25 December of people asking for advice about Heartburn is a burning caused by stomach acid travelling up towards the throat, also It's usually felt directly in the chest, but can also rise to the throat and result in an acidic or bitter taste in the mouth. The pain is often worse after eating, when lying down, or in the evening, and although it is typically not a cause for concern, it can be very uncomfortable. Here we have a look at what heartburn is, and how to avoid it: According to the NHS, heartburn is a burning feeling in the chest caused by acid reflux, which tends to happen after meals or at night. This is when stomach acid travels up towards the throat. If it keeps happening, it may be called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The main symptoms of acid reflux are a burning sensation in the middle of your chest and an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid. You may also have a cough or hiccups that keep coming back, a hoarse voice, bad breath, or feel bloated or sick. Symptoms are often worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over. The NHS says that while there’s no obvious reason behind heartburn, it can be made worse by certain food and drink. This includes coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods. Other factors include, being overweight, smoking, pregnancy, stress and anxiety and an increase in some types of hormones, such as progesterone and oestrogen. Some medicines such as ibuprofen can also make heartburn worse. Other reasons include a hiatus hernia, which is when part of your stomach moves up into your chest, a stomach ulcer or a bacterial infection in your stomach. There are some simple ways to avoid heartburn, including which foods to eat and avoid and even which side to sleep on. Speaking to Lorraine Kelly on Thursday, Dr Hilary Jones advised people to try to avoid too many fry ups, and to opt for a yoghurt bowl instead. “All that grease, all that fat, means that your stomach stays fuller for longer with lots of acid in it,” he said. His second piece of advice was to swap acidic bubbles such as Champagne for more stomach-friendly festive tipples, such as red wine or gin. Eating earlier could also help with heartburn, Dr Jones said: “Your stomach takes two to three hours to empty, so best to go to sleep on an empty stomach rather than a full one.” When you do go to bed, Dr Jones said it is best to sleep on your left side: “Using gravity and anatomy, you’re less likely to get heartburn on your left side because your stomach is more on your left side.” The NHS says recommend medicines called antacids or alginates can help ease your symptoms. These are taken with food or soon after eating, as this is when you're most likely to get heartburn.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Search and recovery teams on Wednesday intensified their operations at the site of a plane crash that killed Libya’s military chief and other high-level officers, working to secure the area and locate the aircraft’s flight recorders after a night of heavy rain and fog, Turkey’s state-run news agency said. The private jet carrying Gen. Muhammad Ali Ahmad al-Haddad, four other officers and three crew members crashed in Turkey on Tuesday after taking off from the capital, , killing everyone on board. Libyan officials said the cause of the crash was a technical malfunction on the plane. The Libyan delegation was on its way back to after holding high-level defense talks in Ankara aimed at boosting military cooperation between the two countries. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah confirmed the deaths, describing the incident on as a “tragic accident” and a “great loss” for Libya. Al-Hadad was the top military commander in western Libya and played a crucial role in the ongoing, U.N.-brokered efforts to unify Libya’s military, which has split, much like Libya’s other institutions. The four other officers who died in the crash were Gen. Al-Fitouri Ghraibil, the head of Libya’s ground forces, Brig. Gen. Mahmoud Al-Qatawi, who led the military manufacturing authority, Mohammed Al-Asawi Diab, advisor to the chief of staff, and Mohammed Omar Ahmed Mahjoub, a military photographer with the chief of staff’s office. The identities of the three crew members were not immediately released. Turkish officials said the Falcon 50 type business jet took off from Ankara’s Esenboga airport at 8:30 p.m. and that contact was lost some 40 minutes later. The plane notified air traffic control of an electrical fault and requested an emergency landing. The aircraft was redirected back to Esenboga, where preparations for its landing began. The plane, however, disappeared from the radar while descending for the emergency landing, the Turkish presidential communications office said. The wreckage was found near the village of Kesikkavak, in Haymana, a district some 70 kilometers (about 43.5 miles) south of Ankara. At Haymana, gendarmerie police sealed off the area where the plane crashed, while the Turkish disaster management agency, AFAD, set up a mobile coordination center, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Specialized vehicles, such as tracked ambulances, were deployed because of the muddy terrain. Anadolu said Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya is expected to visit the site along with prosecutors assigned to lead the investigation. Libya was also expected to send a team to Ankara to work with Turkish authorities investigating the crash. While in Ankara, al-Haddad had met with Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler and other officials. Libya plunged into chaos after the country’s 2011 uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The country split, with rival administrations in the east and west, backed by an array of rogue militias and foreign governments. Turkey has been allied with Libya’s government in the west, but has recently taken steps to improve ties with the eastern-based government as well. Tuesday’s visit by the Libyan delegation came a day after Turkey’s parliament approved to extend the mandate of Turkish troops serving in Libya for two years. Turkey deployed troops following a 2019 security and military cooperation agreement that was reached between Ankara and the Tripoli-based government.",The Independent,The Independent

With a small detail of security forces standing guard outside, members of Mar Elias Church held on Tuesday evening and lit an image of Christmas tree made of neon lights on the wall of the courtyard outside. The tree was hung with pictures of those who were killed in the attack. They include three men the congregation hails as heroes for tackling the bomber, potentially averting a much higher death toll in the June 22 attack. A man opened fire then detonated an explosive vest inside the Greek Orthodox church in Dweil’a on the outskirts of Damascus as it was filled with people praying on a Sunday. Before he detonated the vest, brothers Boutros and Gergis Bechara and another congregant, Milad Haddad, tackled the shooter and pushed him out of the center of the church, congregants said. “If it weren’t for the three of them, maybe not one person would remain out of 400 people,” said Imad Haddad, the brother of Milad Haddad, who attended Tuesday's Christmas tree lighting. He hasn't decorated for Christmas or put up a tree at home, but gathering at the church was “is a message of peace and love” and a message that “we are believers and we are strong and we are steadfast in spite of everything,"" he said.

There have been several deadly outbreaks of sectarian violence in the country in the past year. While the new government has condemned attacks on minorities, many accuse it of failing to act to control the armed factions it is trying to absorb into the new state army and security forces. The June attack was blamed on an Islamic State cell, which authorities said had also planned to target a Shiite shrine. IS did not claim responsibility for the attack, while a little-known group called Saraya Ansar al-Sunna said one of its members had carried out the attack.

Now many are once again seeking to leave. Since losing her husband in the church attack, Juliette Alkashi feels numb. The couple had been sweethearts before she left Syria with her mother and brother to emigrate to Venezuela. In 2018, when Emile Bechara asked her to marry him, Alkashi moved back to Syria even though it was still in the midst of a civil war. “Whatever is going to happen will happen, and I’ve surrendered to it,"" she said.

He believes today that even the seemingly senseless violence was part of God's plan. “Our God is present, and He was present in the church,” he said. Yohanna Shehadeh, the priest of Mar Elias church, acknowledged many in the congregation are afraid of more deadly violence. “Fear is a natural state.

Carol Howle, BP’s interim chief executive, said the agreed sale of Castrol was “a very good outcome for all stakeholders”. “The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy,” she said. “We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.” BP announced last week the appointment of Meg O’Neill as its new chief executive after the abrupt departure of boss Murray Auchincloss. Mr Auchincloss was in the top job for less than two years, overseeing the company’s decision to “reset” its strategy by scaling back renewables projects and renewing its focus on oil and gas. Ms O’Neill will be the first woman to run BP and the first outsider to take up the post, having headed up oil and gas firm Woodside Energy since April 2021.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our A man has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for Liu Ming, 26, boarded the Dubai to Singapore flight on 7 August and attempted to steal items from the bag of an Azerbaijani man and his wife in the business class cabin. Liu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to one charge of theft. The court was told that Liu boarded the flight specifically with the aim of stealing high-value items from fellow business class passengers. Liu was seated five rows in front of an Azerbaijani business class passenger, 52, and one row in front of his victim’s wife. In the early hours of 8 August, Liu tried to act after the dinner service had finished and the cabin lights had been dimmed. The victim was asleep, but his wife woke up from a short nap to see Liu walking to her husband’s seat and taking the victim’s luggage from the overhead compartment, carrying it back to his seat. The victim’s wife confronted the man and alerted the cabin crew after she did not understand his response. After realising he was in trouble, Liu returned to the victim’s seat and replaced the luggage in the compartment from where he had taken it. Liu told the cabin crew that he had taken the luggage by mistake after confusing it with his own bag. The cabin crew informed group staff at Changi Airport, and Liu was arrested upon arrival at the airport. The victim’s bag contained items with a value exceeding S$100,000 (£57,625). The items included cash and a Huawei laptop worth about S$2,100, 56 cigars worth more than S$5,400, a Chopard watch worth more than S$35,000, and an Audemars Piguet watch worth more than S$51,000. No items were found missing, the court heard, because the victim’s wife confronted Liu soon after he took the luggage from the compartment. Police said Liu was uncooperative during investigations and continued to deny the theft and maintain that it was a mistake. However, Liu’s bag was entirely different from the victim’s bag, differing in both appearance and material. Deputy public prosecutor Cheah Wenjie sought up to 20 months in jail. “The proliferation of theft offences on board Singapore’s national carrier would tarnish its reputation, and that of Singapore’s tourist industry,” he said.

There are no major chains, no advertising billboards, and only a few basic shops in the sleepy main town of Santo António. colonisation, when the islands served as a base for trading slaves, the ruins of sugar cane and cocoa plantations have since been reclaimed by the jungle. Residents have admirably chosen to reject palm oil cultivation projects in favour of ecotourism, guided by the pioneering enterprise HBD, which manages three properties on Principe and recently acquired the only other hotel in operation. The backstory for HBD (Here Be Dragons) is an unusual one. Making history by being the first African to enter space in 2002, entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth had an epiphany while staring down at our tiny blue planet. By the time he’d landed back on Earth, he was determined to do whatever he could to protect it. Initially, he looked at Principe as a private island investment but soon realised the population – the true custodians of the wild environment – would benefit from tourism. His intention was to create jobs by opening the destination up to the rest of the world, without disrupting the natural beauty at its core. Set on a remote peninsula at the northern tip of the island, Bom Bom, a former fishing lodge, was the first hotel to open. A smart but unassuming collection of bungalows with two beachfronts – for sunset and sunrise – it’s since achieved accidental cult status.

Although there have been several enhancements to Bom Bom, including a recently opened restaurant and a beach bar in the pipeline, growth is still refreshingly slow. Even getting here is a journey, requiring a flight via But distance and difficulty are in part responsible for preserving this time-frozen patch of paradise. In 2012, thanks partly to the efforts of HBD and rallying from members of the local community, the entire island and its islets were declared a Unesco World Biosphere.

During the years of Portuguese rule, a cocoa industry thrived on the island. HBD has revived production on a small scale at heritage property Roca Sundy, a former plantation open to guests. A small shop sells edible and cosmetic products. Beyond the beach, the mountainous interior is well suited to hikes. One of the most popular routes is to the top of Pico do Papagaio (Parrot Peak), one of several phonolitic towers. HBD is in the process of launching a new Natural Dividend project which will financially reward islanders for their efforts in protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.

Read our Although most of us will be exposed human papillomavirus (HPV) at some point in our lives, it remains widely misunderstood. result can be worrying and confusing, yet the link between HPV and cervical cancer is more nuanced than many people realise. We spoke to Miss Adeola Olaitan, consultant gynaecological oncologist at , part of HCA Healthcare UK, who explained what HPV is, how it relates to cervical cancer and addressed some common myths around this topic. “HPV is a family of viruses that infect the skin and the mucosal tissue,” explains Olaitan. “There are different subtypes of HPV which are denoted by numbers.” You can get HPV from any skin-to-skin contact of the genital area, vaginal, anal or oral sex or through sharing sex toys, according to the Most of the time HPV does not cause any problems, highlights the gynaecological oncologist. “In most cases, HPV is a transient, harmless condition, and most people clear it without even knowing that they had it,” says Olaitan. “It will usually clear naturally within two years.” “I think the biggest misconception about HPV is the stigma surrounding it,” says Olaitan. “Because it’s a sexually associated infection, people think it has connotations of promiscuity, which it doesn’t. You can have sex once and get HPV.” There are over 200 types of HPV, according to , and they are split into two groups: low-risk HPV and high-risk HPV. Around 14 types of HPV are considered high risk for cervical cancer and two of these types (HPV 16 and HPV 18) cause about 70 out of 100 (70%) of all cervical cancer cases, according to “HPV 16 and HPV 18 can infect the cervix, and if the infection persists then they can increase the risk of cervical cancer,” explains Olaitan. “There are usually no symptoms of HPV, so if you don’t go to a cervical cancer screening, you won’t know you have it,” says Olaitan. “The knowledge of whether you have HPV or not is only important because it marks people out as having a greater risk of having abnormal cells, which if left undetected or untreated can increase the risk of cervical cancer.” Everyone with a cervix should be invited for screening by the every five years from the age 25 to 64, according to the . It also states that during the screening appointment, a small sample of cells is taken from your cervix and the sample is checked for high-risk HPV types that can cause changes to the cells of your cervix. “If the initial screening finds high-risk HPV, a reflex cytology test would be conducted on the same sample to look for abnormal cells,” explains Olaitan. “If that finds no abnormal cells, you will be told to come back for a screening at a shorter interval. However, if abnormal cells are found you will be referred for a colposcopy to have a closer look at the cervix.” “The HPV vaccine is very effective at protecting people against HPV,” says Olaitan. “It’s typically given to children between the ages of 11 and 13 and is licensed to the age of 45, but it’s less effective the older you are. “But you can have it even if you’ve been exposed to HPV or you have a current HPV infection, and it gives immunity that’s stronger and longer lasting than natural immunity alone. So, it’s still good to have it, but it’s better to have it when you’re young.” “The most common symptoms of cervical cancer are bleeding after sex, bleeding in between periods, bleeding after the menopause, or an offensive, persistent vagina discharge,” highlights Olaitan. “Most of the time these symptoms are indicative of benign conditions, but it’s important that they’re not ignored and that you go and get them checked to exclude anything more serious going on.” “Remember that cervical cancer is preventable, and people who go for regular screenings are unlikely to get cancer,” says Olaitan. “ and being vaccinated are two of the most important things you can do for your health.”",The Independent,The Independent

The star, best known for her portrayal of Ellen Ripley in Ridley Scott’s Alien franchise, made it clear that she and Champion did not actually kiss for the scene, stating: “Obviously, I wasn’t going to kiss Jack, who was 14 or 15, in real life. Instead, Cameron asked Champion, now 21 years old, to “pick someone [Weaver] could kiss and he did”. Similarly, she said, “I imagine when I wasn’t there, they picked someone appropriate for Jack”. Speaking about the age gap between them, Weaver continued: “That concern about all of that, which is quite legitimate, was going on. And I’m glad the scene survived, because when I saw it, I believed it. “It’s so genuine between the two of them, and any concern about Jack’s real age and my real age, I think there’s no room for it there,” she added.

She praised Jack’s portrayal of Spider – a “human boy” who connects with the Na’vi species – saying that he breathed life into this “interesting role”. “I thought Jack was just terrific in the film. It just drives the whole film,” she said, “that incredible tension in a mixed-race family where the parents have completely opposite feelings and the children don’t have those feelings. I thought it would really resonate in our complicated world.” , Champion shed some light on their dynamic, revealing that when he and Weaver first met they only had one scripted scene. “But then for the next like 30 minutes, Sigourney and I just literally riffed,” he recalled. “We really just used our imagination, and it was fun. Really, since the very beginning, Sigourney and I have been so locked in imaginatively that I’ve always been able [to] see Sigourney, then see Kiri.” ’s film critic Clarisse Loughrey notes: “James Cameron’s blue epic remains visually impressive, but it’s frustrating how little he gives his actors to do.”",The Independent,The Independent

But it’s , and indulging in a treat or two can be a fun and healthy part of life – especially when this classic biscuit includes many nutrients that may benefit your health. Gingerbread is believed to have originated in its earliest form in 2400BC ancient Greece. Surprisingly, this at all – and was actually a honey cake. But the version of gingerbread we know and love today didn’t start to take shape until the 11th century when in the Middle East with ginger in hand. Ginger was first cultivated in ancient China, where it was commonly used as a medical treatment. This led to the cooks of nobility in Europe to begin experimenting with ginger in their cooking. As ginger and other spices became more affordable to the masses in the mid-1600s, gingerbread caught on. The original term “gingerbread” referred to preserved ginger, which was developed into a confection made with honey and spices. Later, the term was used to refer to the French confectionery pain d'epices (spice bread) and the German But the gingerbread house, which is now a staple of modern Christmas traditions, is believed to have been invented in 18th-century Germany, thanks to the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. The practice then spread to England at some point during the 19th century. is credited with creating the first gingerbread men. She would delight visiting dignitaries with gingerbread figures baked into their likeness. Despite its ancient origins, baking gingerbread during the holiday season remains a celebrated tradition in many parts of the world. For example, in Sweden, designing and building gingerbread houses is traditional during the Christmas season and symbolises holiday spirits, family bonding and Swedish heritage. Bergen, in Norway, is said to have the largest gingerbread town in the world. Every year since 1991, local businesses and thousands of volunteers help to make the “pepperkakebyen” (gingerbread town).

These biscuits come in various shapes and varieties and have been a tradition in the city of Torun since the 14th century. Several towns and villages in the UK are associated with gingerbread – including Gasmere, Whitby, Preston and Ormskirk. Gingerbread was incredibly popular in the north of England thanks to the gingerbread ladies of Ormskirk, who began making it as early as 1732. It was so popular, in fact, that King Edward VII would have the royal train stop at Ormskirk on the way to Balmoral to stock up on gingerbread. Gingerbread is enjoyed in many countries. But while each place may have its own take on the confection, the one thing that remains consistent is the spices they include – the key ingredient being ginger. Ginger has a long history of use in various forms of traditional and alternative medicine. Research shows it , reduce nausea and help fight the common cold and flu. It’s also believed ginger may support weight management, help manage arthritis and may also alleviate menstrual symptoms. Molasses is another ingredient sometimes found in gingerbread. It’s made by refining sugarcane or sugar beet juice. Molasses is naturally rich in antioxidants, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous and vitamin B6. All of these important vitamins and minerals may help relieve constipation, treat anaemia and support bone and hair health. Cinnamon is another key ingredient of gingerbread. It’s a particularly versatile spice with . It has antimicrobial properties and is also rich in antioxidants – natural molecules that may help protect against diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Cinnamon may also help lower inflammation and can be a useful anti-ageing ingredient for the skin. Research has also shown that it may improve dental hygiene, reduce cholesterol and lower blood pressure. Similarly, nutmeg – another common ingredient in gingerbread – is associated with reduced inflammation and may benefit heart health. While, of course, gingerbread also contains ingredients that aren’t good for your health if you eat too much of it (such as sugar), at least you can feel a little less guilty if you indulge in a gingerbread biscuit this holiday season as it contains some beneficial ingredients. But for those who feel they need to watch their diet, there are ways you can make gingerbread healthier. For example, use almond flour instead of regular flour. This gives a boost of protein, which may make you feel fuller and help stop over-eating. Almond flour is also a great gluten-free option. You can also swap butter with coconut oil or olive oil, which may have less of an effect on cholesterol levels compared to butter. Adding nuts, seeds and raisins to decorate can also be an easy way to add nutrients (such as vitamin E, magnesium and selenium) and fibre.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our The United States and Ukraine have reached a consensus on several critical issues aimed at bringing an end to the nearly four-year conflict, but sensitive issues around territorial control in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, along with the management of the nuclear power plant, remain unresolved, Ukraine’s president said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke as the U.S. showed the 20-point plan, hammered out after marathon talks in in recent days, to Russian negotiators. A response is expected from Moscow on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian president briefed journalists on each point of the plan on Tuesday. His comments were embargoed until Wednesday morning. The draft proposal, which reflects Ukraine’s wishes, intertwines political and commercial interests to safeguard security while boosting economic potential. At the heart of the negotiations lies the contentious territorial dispute concerning the regions, known as the Donbas. This is “the most difficult point,” Zelenskyy said. He said these matters will be discussed at the leaders level. Russia continues to assert maximalist demands, insisting that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory in Donesk that it has not captured — an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk. In a bid to facilitate compromise, the United States has proposed transforming these areas into free economic zones. Ukraine insists that any arrangement must be contingent upon a referendum, allowing the Ukrainian people to determine their own fate. Ukraine is demanding the demilitarization of the area and the presence of an international force to ensure stability, Zelenskyy said. How the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest plant in Europe which is under Russian occupation, will be managed is another contentious issue. The U.S. is proposing a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, with each party having an equal stake in the enterprise. But Zelenskyy countered with a joint venture proposal between the U.S. and Ukraine, in which the Americans are able to decide how to distribute their share, presuming it would go to Russia. “We did not reach a consensus with the American side on the territory of the Donetsk region and on the ZNPP,” Zelenskyy said, referring to the power plant in Zaporizhzhia. “But we have significantly brought most of the positions closer together. In principle, all other consensus in this agreement has been found between us and them.” Point 14, which covers territories that cut across the eastern front line, and Point 12, which discusses management of the Zaporizhzhia plant, will likely be major sticking points in the talks. Zelenskyy said: “We are in a situation where the Russians want us to leave the Donetsk region, and the Americans are trying to find a way so that it is ‘not a way out’ — because we are against leaving — they want to find a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone in this, that is, a format that can provide for the views of both sides.” The draft states that the contact line, which cuts across five Ukrainian regions, be frozen once the agreement is signed. Ukraine’s stance is that any attempt to create a free economic zone must be ratified by a referendum, affirming that the Ukrainian people ultimately hold the decision-making power, Zelenskyy said. This process will require 60 days, he added, during which time hostilities should stop to allow the process to happen. More difficult discussions would require hammering out how far troops would be required to move back, per Ukraine’s proposal, and where international forces would be s tationed. Zelenskyy said ultimately “people can choose: this ending suits us or not,” he said. The draft also proposes that Russian forces withdraw from Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, and that international forces be located along the contact line to monitor the implementation of the agreement. “Since there is no faith in the Russians, and they have repeatedly broken their promises, today’s contact line is turning into a line of a de facto free economic zone, and international forces should be there to guarantee that no one will enter there under any guise — neither ‘little green men’ nor Russian military disguised as civilians,” Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is also proposing that the occupied city of Enerhodar, which is connected to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, be a demilitarized free economic zone, Zelenskyy said. This point required 15 hours of discussions with the U.S., he said. For now, the U.S. proposes that the plant be jointly operated by Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia, with each side receiving dividends from the enterprise. “The USA is offering 33 percent for 33 percent for 33 percent, and the Americans are the main manager of this joint venture,” he said. “It is clear that for Ukraine this sounds very unsuccessful and not entirely realistic. How can you have joint commerce with the Russians after everything?” Ukraine offered an alternative proposal, that the plant be operated by a joint venture with the U.S. in which the Americans can determine independently how to distribute their 50 percent share. Zelenskyy said billions in investments are needed to make the plant run again, including restoring the adjacent dam. “There were about 15 hours of conversations about the plant. These are all very complex things.” The document ensures that Ukraine will be provided with “strong” security guarantees that mirror NATO’s Article 5, which would obligate Ukraine’s partners to act in the event of renewed Russian aggression. Zelenskyy said that a separate bilateral document with the U.S. will outline these guarantees. This agreement will detail the conditions under which security will be provided, particularly in the event of a renewed Russian assault, and will establish a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire. This mechanism will utilize satellite technology and early warning systems to ensure effective oversight and rapid response capabilities. “The mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step towards Ukraine on their part. They believe that they are giving strong security guarantees,” he said. The draft contains other elements including keeping Ukraine’s army at 800,000 during peace time, and by nailing down a specific date for ascension to the European Union. The document proposes accelerating a free trade agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. once the agreement is signed. The U.S. wants the same deal with Russia, said Zelenskyy. Ukraine would like to receive short-term privileged access to the European market and a robust global development package, that will cover a wide-range of economic interests, including a development fund to invest in industries including technology, data centers and artificial intelligence, as well as gas. Also included are funds for the reconstruction of territories destroyed in the war. “Ukraine will have the opportunity to determine the priorities for distributing its share of funds in the territories under the control of Ukraine. And this is a very important point, on which we spent a lot of time,” Zelenskyy said. The goal will be to attract $800 billion through equity, grants, loans and private sector contributions. The draft proposal also requires Ukraine to hold elections after the signing of the agreement. “This is the partners’ vision,” Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is also asking that all prisoners since 2014 be released at once, and that civilian detainees, political prisoners and children be returned to Ukraine.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our films this weekend gone (alright, three weekends ago). One of them was the hilariously awful , starring Schwarzenegger, Sinbad (the comedian, not the sailor) and that kid who played Darth Vader. Like many festive films, it has become a relatable cult classic. Two dads scrambling for a sold-out superhero toy on Eve, having failed to get their act together earlier. It is an ordeal many parents know all too well, including my own. My mum still remembers being harangued to within an inch of her sanity while hunting for a Tamagotchi for me in the 90s. She succeeded where Arnie failed because she’s brilliant. All of which raises a valid question. Why do some create such desperate demand, especially when a few of them come with very real safety concerns? People born in the 1960s or 70s may remember the children’s toy clackers. They were two hard polymer spheres attached to either end of a cord. When swung in an up-and-down rhythm, they clacked together repeatedly and loudly. Often unnervingly. See for yourself. The nervous sideways glances in the commercial make sense. Children had good reason to fear these things. Clackers were capable of causing as many injuries as the Argentinian bolas, the weapon they were based on. Early versions were made of glass which could, and regularly did, shatter on impact. This sent sharp fragments flying everywhere and occasionally into eyes. Plastic versions replaced the glass but did not make them much safer. Children used them as makeshift flails which resulted in black eyes, nosebleeds and even fractures. Many schools banned them, alongside conkers and other “wizzo” games straight out of Just William. Variants still exist, usually as cheap plastic versions with far less force behind them. They have even enjoyed a recent revival in Egypt (where they were briefly banned for being crude) and in Indonesia and the Philippines, where they are known as lato-lato and have sparked competitions. Injuries presumably continue. My daughter once had a set of magnetised building blocks shaped like triangles and squares. She adored them. , and it is easy to overlook how hazardous they can be. Dan Baumgardt is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Bristol. and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. Read the The risk becomes apparent when a child manages to detach a magnet from a toy. This creates not only a choking hazard but also a serious internal risk if swallowed. Any suspected ingestion requires immediate medical attention. The danger stems from magnetic attraction. If two or more , or other metallic toy parts, are swallowed, they can attract each other through the walls of the intestines and effectively pin sections of the gut together. This can cause obstruction, perforations and internal bleeding, among other serious complications. Swallowed magnets or metallic objects of any number should never be left to pass naturally. It is always a medical emergency. are a more recent addition to the toy world. They are small polymer pellets that expand dramatically when placed in water. Originally marketed for floral displays, they have become popular in arts and crafts and as sensory toys. The beads are made from super-absorbent polymers that can swell to a diameter of one or two centimetres within hours. Like magnets, they are a choking hazard. If swallowed, they can also swell inside the body and block the intestines. A recent study described two cases of intestinal obstruction caused by water beads. In one case, a bead had expanded to four centimetres in size, and required surgery. Sadly, these are not isolated incidents, and some cases have involved other severe medical complications. Water beads have also been marketed for children with sensory processing disorders and autism. This is especially concerning, as these children may not be able to communicate early symptoms of discomfort should they happen to swallow any beads. Spare a thought for the adults who find themselves in the thick of these toy crazes. Not just my poor mum who endured something close to the seventh circle of hell in a packed John Lewis to locate the digital pet I wanted. Power Rangers, Teletubbies and Buzz Lightyears have caused similar panics over the years. There have even been cases of serious injuries and fatalities caused by stampedes during Black Friday toy rushes. The message is simple. Choose toys that are safe and age-appropriate, and supervise playtime where necessary. A seemingly harmless children’s toy can turn into something much more dangerous in seconds. At Christmas, when homes are busy and distractions are many, a little extra caution goes a long, long way.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our A Devon family is raising urgent awareness about the dangers of natural pools following a harrowing escape from drowning during a trip to the Canary Islands. Their experience unfolded on Sunday, December 7, at a man-made natural pool in Los Gigantes, on Tenerife's western coast. The location is where a series of powerful waves tragically claimed four lives, with another person still unaccounted for. Kai Barrington, 42, Sarah Jellard, 39, and their 20-month-old baby, from Braunton, were visiting the popular tourist spot on the same fateful day. Around 4pm, Mr Barrington had entered the water with numerous other visitors, while Ms Jellard and their toddler remained in a safer, elevated position. Minutes later, a series of large waves hit the shore, engulfing the pool and taking a dozen swimmers with it. Mr Barrington, an experienced surfer, stayed under the wave and clung onto the bottom of the pool, which he says saved his life. He said: “Because I was in a sea pool as the waves were crashing over and I being tumbled around a bit, I didn’t really think anything of it. It’s a scenario I’m used to and comfortable. “It was really only when I’d come up, I think maybe the second time after one of the big waves had hit, and I was holding onto the bottom with my fingertips, that I realised I was being pulled over the edge. “I saw two people to the left of me get pulled over the side.” Ms Jellard, who sat a few metres up, witnessed her partner struggling in water and being shuffled around by waves as a group of individuals was being pulled away into the ocean. She said: “I started looking out to sea, looking out for Kai and it’s the most helpless situation you can ever be in because there’s nothing you can do, there’s no ropes around you, there’s nothing, emergency services have been called, there’s nothing you can do but just watch your love in the sea. “I then watched someone swim, I didn’t know who it was because I couldn’t (see) at such a distance. “I watched them drown. I saw them swim and take their last stroke, and then not take another one.” , led to the discovery of the bodies of a 35-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman, and the body of another man about whom no information was given. A woman who had been airlifted to hospital died the following day. Mr Barrington, who managed to reach safety, was taken to hospital before being released. The Spanish archipelago, located off the coast of north-west Africa, has dozens of natural rock pools, some of which have been made accessible to swimmers with concrete walls and steps.

According to the couple, the water had been calm that day, with no obvious sign of danger and no barriers preventing entry. They now want to raise awareness of the dangers of man-made natural pools, adding they would not have taken any risks, particularly with a toddler, had they known about the potential harm. The family said more should be done to inform tourists of possible changes in weather conditions and hazards around such spots. Ms Jellard added: “To those poor families, it didn’t have to happen and they didn’t do anything wrong that day. They did exactly what we did. We went down on a sunny day where the sea looked calm. “When we left, we were turning people away to say ‘don’t go there, don’t go there’. “There’s been fatalities that they wouldn’t have even known of because the sea looked so calm.

Read our as turkey, year in year out. Yet many of us still haven’t quite mastered the art of a perfectly roasted bird. Disappointing, slightly dry turkey is a feature on festive tables across the country. on there and call it delicious (because it would be rude to the cook not to) but what tricks are you missing to really make the meat juicy and delicious? From shopping to cooking and carving, top chefs share their most important advice for getting that starter winner 2024, and chef at The Sardine Factory in Looe, says: “When looking for your turkey, always look at the size and the shape. You want to pick the roundest, most plump turkey that there is, as that means it will be the most tasty as it was a healthy bird. Don’t go for one that looks a little bit skinny, as it means it didn’t have a very good life and possibly wasn’t very healthy. “Also, you do tend to get what you pay for – so if you afford to spend a little bit more on your turkey, then do it! Local producers from well-known farms, local reputable butchers and organic delivery services tend to be the best bet and worth the extra buck.” Many of us are guilty of buying an enormous turkey for small family, vowing to eat it all as leftovers for days, but the cook will be easier for a smaller bird. “Think about it sensibly,” says TV celebrity chef James Martin, whose latest book (Quadrille, £25) is available now. “You’re probably better off, if you’re only a family of six, just getting a turkey crown rather than the whole thing – that will reduce the cooking time down by half.” You want to get the right size and have some left over for the next day, says Gaucho’s culinary director Anthony Ekizian. “Usually, a small turkey is good enough for five or six people, a medium to large for over eight people. It needs to look plump and try to choose free-range. Bronze turkey is always better, if you can afford it.” Some chefs swear by brining the turkey before cooking it. Scottish chef, Dean Banks, a former BBC finalist, says it helps create “the juiciest, most flavourful” turkey. “Grab a large storage box. Fill it with water and 10% salt, then add festive spices like cinnamon sticks, cloves, bay leaves, and orange peel. Submerge the turkey, cover it with the lid, and leave it overnight in your garden,” he says. “This method seasons the meat all the way through, ensuring a tender and juicy bird.” Dylan James, head chef at Cambium, at Careys Manor Hotel and SenSpa, agrees: “Brining the turkey is an excellent way to ensure the meat stays beautifully moist after cooking. “The process also seasons the bird all the way through, so there’s no need for extra seasoning before roasting. For perfectly crispy skin, once the turkey has been brined, pat it dry, and leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight. This allows the skin to dry out, ensuring it crisps up wonderfully when roasted.” But you don’t want to put the turkey straight from a cold fridge into a hot oven. Theo Randall, chef patron at Theo Randall at the InterContinental, recommends: “Take out your turkey from the fridge at least an hour before you cook it. This will speed up the cooking and make the bird roast better.” The major mistake many homecooks make is cooking the turkey whole, says judge and chef Marcus Wareing, whose latest book (HarperNonfiction, £22) is available now, says. “No matter how small or big, it will never be fully cooked in the leg and the thigh before the breast has dried out. The breast will always dry up, so you’re always going to be caught between a rock and a hard place. He suggests: “Take the legs and the thighs off and get your butcher to bone them and roll them for you, and cook them separately. And just cook the breast on the crown [the white meat on the bone], or take them off the crown and cook them slowly. “More than not, I think most people overcook their turkeys for the sake of making sure that the thighs are cooked.” Martin adds: “It goes dry because its overcooked – fundamentally. Few of them need six hours – which I’ve seen people do before – I mean, it’s going to be ruined. Naturally, it’s a dry meat anyway. “That’s why you better off buying a crown if you if you’re not cooking for big volume.” Adding butter under the skin can help pack in the moisture in too. “Make a self-basting flavoured butter,” suggests Palmer. “Add garlic, seasoning, lemon, thyme and sage to salted butter and give it all a great mix together and then smother the butter between the breast and the skin. “You can lift up the skin at the cavity and use your fingers to separate the skin from the breast meat before smothering the butter across the breast and letting the skin resettle over the top. As the turkey cooks, all the butter will baste the crown gradually, making it beautifully moist and exceptionally tasty.” Part of the stress of preparing the Christmas meal is trying to time everything so that your potatoes go crispy at the right time, while your gravy comes together and all of the many elements are still warm. But when it comes to turkey, Martin suggests getting that out the way to free up oven space for your sides – giving it enough time to rest as well. “Don’t be frightened to cook it in advance, get up in the morning, put it in the oven, take it out a good two hours before you need it. “A lot of people panic and try to do everything at the last minute. And whenever you see a chef work, and we do in roast meats, we would never, ever take it out of the oven and put it straight onto the table. You need to leave it to rest for at least an hour. Leaving it to rest will generally cause it to be better, because you can put that moisture on it while it’s resting – you can keep basting it over the top.” Removing the turkey from the oven with plenty of time to spare will also give you enough time to finish the rest of your sides. “That gives the heat of the oven [time] to come back up to temperature to then do your roast potatoes and stuff like that,” says Martin. People try and cram everything in and [as] you’re putting more and more stuff in, the temperature is coming down, so it takes longer and longer to cook.” Plus, the turkey resting time is “really, really important” for taste, says Wareing. “It just solidifies the natural juices of the turkey. “My turkey sits, probably for an hour, because I need the pan for the gravy, I need the oven space. Never be afraid to rest, and don’t worry about having to serve it hot.” Carving the turkey at the Christmas table is one of those key moments on the big day. But after all that time cooking, brining, basting and resting, try not to make a complete hash of serving it. “Take the breast fully off the bone, don’t carve it on the bone, just take [a knife] right down the centre, take the whole breast off, and then just carve it into nice slices,” says Wareing. “You get a lovely slice. It’s all cut beautifully. “I remember watching my dad do it. It was just a mess. There was so much meat left on [it].”",The Independent,The Independent

There is undoubtedly a personal cost to individual women, both physically and mentally, and living with PCOS can be a significant financial, health-care and work-life burden for many women, too, which may disproportionately affect those in lower socioeconomic groups. These experiences are further compounded by a system failure to properly diagnose and manage their symptoms. Women report doctors ignoring or dismissing their concerns, not believing them and struggling to make a diagnosis. In fact, a large international survey reported it can take several months, and even several years, before women are diagnosed. PCOS symptoms can vary between different women, but it is important to discuss the possibility of PCOS with your doctor, because careful management and/or treatment can help protect against developing more serious related health issues. Common symptoms include: Despite PCOS first being diagnosed almost a century ago, there is no single test to confirm whether a woman has it, and there is no cure. If your doctor suspects you may have PCOS, they may order blood work to check your hormone levels and an ultrasound to check your ovaries. Unlike ovarian cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs that develop on or inside an ovary and can be painful, polycystic ovaries are enlarged, with multiple follicles that can be seen on ultrasound. If PCOS is diagnosed, further testing for cholesterol and glucose levels is likely in order to manage Researchers also suggest ways women with PCOS can help manage their condition, which include: Despite the current problems, improvement is possible, and there have been sustained efforts in recent years — all over the world — to advocate for women with this condition and invest in PCOS research.

Dr Salwa Malik, vice president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said, “Any one of these three objects could be found under your tree or in a stocking this festive season, hidden in gifts that are intended to bring joy to a child or vulnerable person, but which, if swallowed, could result in critical illness and the need for emergency medical treatment. “As an emergency medicine doctor, I have seen parents holding their child’s hand and watching over them while they lay on a bed in an Emergency Department, in need of urgent care because they have ingested one of these items. “As a parent, I can imagine how utterly terrifying and traumatic that would be to go through – for a mum, dad, grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle, brother, sister and of course, the child themselves. “Having seen the effects first hand, which can be devastating and detrimental, we are asking people to please think twice about the dangers these pose while selecting and gifting presents this season. “We are also raising awareness within emergency departments by circulating these safety flashes to ensure our colleagues in emergency departments are aware and informed about the dangers and equipped with the best clinical guidance to treat a child, or vulnerable person should they seek help after swallowing these objects.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our with new technology that can selectively target cancerous cells whilst sparing healthy tissue. A team at RMIT University in Melbourne say that extremely small metal particles – which they dub ‘nanodots’ – could be capable of identifying and , opening up new possibilities for targeted therapies. The research remains in its early stages, so far only being tested on lab-grown cells and not yet animals or humans. However, the findings point to an effective new strategy that exploits Dr Baoyue Zhang from RMIT's School of Engineering explains: “Cancer cells already live under higher stress than healthy ones.” “Our particles push that stress a little further – enough to trigger self-destruction in cancer cells, while healthy cells cope just fine.” The nanodots are engineered from molybdenum oxide, a compound derived from molybdenum, a rare metal widely utilised in electronics and industrial applications. Dr Zhang says that subtle alterations to the metal's chemical structure prompts it to release reactive oxygen molecules. These unstable oxygen forms are known to damage vital cellular components, ultimately triggering cell death. treatments inflict damage on healthy tissue alongside tumours, meaning the ability to amplify within cancer cells could pave the way for more targeted and less harmful therapies. The nanodots are also crafted from a widely available metal oxide rather than expensive or toxic noble metals like gold or silver and so hold the potential for more affordable and safer manufacturing. In laboratory experiments, the nanodots demonstrated significant selectivity, eradicating cervical cancer cells at three times the rate observed in healthy cells over a 24-hour period. Researchers were able to achieve this effect by adjusting the metal’s composition, introducing minute quantities of hydrogen and ammonium. This fine-tuning caused the particles to generate elevated levels of oxygen molecules, which then propelled cancer cells into apoptosis, the body's natural mechanism for eliminating damaged cells. team says it is continuing to advance the . The next stage of the work focusing on ensuring that the nanodots become even more targeted, activating only inside of tumours and never affecting healthy tissue. Researchers are also seeking to begin testing the particles in animals, and establish scalable manufacturing methods.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our The US dollar is poised for its most significant annual decline since 2017, currently on the back foot as market sentiment points towards further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year. This outlook persists despite robust US GDP figures released on Tuesday, which failed to alter investor expectations for monetary policy. Analysts are now pricing in approximately two additional Fed rate reductions in 2026. David Mericle, Chief US Economist at Goldman Sachs, commented on the situation, stating: ""We expect the FOMC to compromise on two more 25 bp cuts to 3-3.25 per cent but see the risks as tilted lower.

In contrast, the euro is up just over 14 per cent for the year thus far, putting it on track for its best performance since 2003. on rates last week and revised upwards some of its growth and inflation projections, in a move that likely closes the door to further easing in the near term.

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/balloon-pant-styling-fashion-advice-b2890064.html,Styling the balloon pant can be tricky. Here’s how to do it at any age,2025-12-24T11:22:24.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Few trouser trends divide opinion quite like the balloon pant. and Nineties, perhaps better known then as “Hammer pants”, the baggy, voluminous and deliberately impractical-looking bottoms have come back into fashion. The style has flooded fashion week runways, being the defining silhouette in spring/summer collections for Chloé, But while designers have embraced exaggerated proportions, many shoppers remain hesitant – unsure whether balloon trousers are chic or one wrong step away from a clown’s costume. According to stylists, the difference lies entirely in the details. So, here’s how to get the balance right when styling balloon pants this season. The biggest mistake people make with balloon pants is assuming the copious amounts of fabric can disguise your figure, and so getting the perfect size isn’t crucial. But in reality, the silhouette demands accuracy. “The first rule [is] ensure the fit is correct,” says stylist to the stars “Length is critical, the hem should hit at or just slightly above the ankle. Consider styles with a proper ankle cuff, rather than an elasticated gathered finish, which can take the look dangerously close to Aladdin territory.” She notes that while the shape may feel unfamiliar, the payoff is worth it. “Get them right and they offer an elegant alternative to the ubiquitous wide-leg trouser, combining comfort with a genuinely dramatic silhouette.” There’s also a practical upside – especially in the UK. “They’re also a great trouser option during wet weather, as no more puddling hemline!” agrees that proportion is everything. “Balloon pants are all about well thought-out volume. “The key is making sure the rest of the outfit feels controlled and streamlined so the silhouette looks fashion-forward rather than overwhelming. “Paying attention to where the trousers sit on the waist is crucial too, because a mid-to-high rise instantly makes the volume feel more flattering and elongates the leg.” Because balloon trousers exaggerate the lower half, the upper body needs to be more pared-back. “Balloon trousers are trickier to style than wide-leg, or straight cuts, due to their unusual proportions,” says Sheridan-Taylor. “In order to balance out the exaggerated balloon silhouette, layering close to the body, with knitwear, like a cashmere tank, or fitted tops worn with a cropped blazer, will help contrast the fluidity of the style.” For a more relaxed approach, she suggests leaning into shape rather than stiffness. “For a simpler casual approach try tucking a shirt into the waistband, but be sure to undo a few extra buttons, to elongate your upper body, creating a flattering inverted V-shape.” Like Sheridan-Taylor notes, when outerwear enters the equation, length matters. “Cropped or waist-length jackets are a stylist’s favourite because they visually ‘cut’ the volume and highlight the waist,” Robb says. “If you prefer something longer, keep it structured and open so you still see definition underneath.” Footwear can either ground balloon pants or throw proportions off entirely. “In winter, structured shoes ground balloon pants best. Chunky loafers, leather ankle boots with a solid sole […] or even a slim Chelsea boot all work brilliantly.” Contrary to popular opinion, Robb warns to “generally avoid very delicate footwear like thin ballet flats or stilettos, as they can make the proportions feel off and slightly dated”. Pointed shoes, however, can work brilliantly to compliment the relaxed silhouette. “The visual line of a pointed heel instantly creates a sharper […] look, while also helping to elongate the leg,” says Sheridan-Taylor. “Ankle boots are also a great choice, as they meet the boot just at the right point.” “Don’t be shy to explore chunkier platform style footwear,” she adds. “A chunkier trainer or sandal is a great way to anchor the billowing fabric.” Not all balloon pants behave the same –and fabric choice determines whether the shape feels cool and architectural or messy and unruly. “Satins and silky fabrics – and even velvet – offer a lustrous finish for eveningwear,” says Sheridan-Taylor, “paired with a silky peplum top and heels for elegant fluidity through the loose silhouette.” For daytime or winter wear, structure matters. “More structured fabrics make the balloon shape more pronounced, like a cotton twill or gabardine, and can be a more wearable option.” Robb says the fabric is very much dependant on the weather. “Fabric choice makes all the difference. In the UK climate, I love wool blends, brushed cotton twill, heavy poplin and soft tailoring fabrics with structure.” She cautions against anything too lightweight, particularly out of the summer season. “Avoid anything too flimsy, as it can look sloppy very quickly.” It’s important to contrast your fabrics, so if you’re wearing casual cotton, wool or cashmere, incorporate shine through accessories like statement earrings, a ring stack or layered bangles.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our On any given evening, as the lights illuminate Act 2 of Bess Wohl’s intergenerational , a distinctive sound fills the theatre: supportive cheers and applause erupt from the audience, often before a single word has been spoken. This spontaneous burst of appreciation, or perhaps solidarity, is a direct response to of Broadway’s bolder scenes this season. On stage, six characters, members of a makeshift 1970s consciousness-raising group, strip naked for a 15-minute dialogue. overshadowing its deeper message. However, she has been ""very gratified"" by the broader conversation it has sparked. ""It doesn’t feel titillating or gratuitous or gimmicky,"" Wohl explains. ""It feels like a really important piece of the work that the women in the consciousness-raising group are doing."" The concept emerged from Wohl’s research into such groups, where she discovered that exploring their own bodies was a significant need for women of diverse ages, races, and economic backgrounds. Set primarily in the 1970s, with occasional shifts to the present, the play draws context from a pivotal era. In 1970, ""Our Bodies, Ourselves,"" the groundbreaking work on women’s health and sexuality, was first self-published, with its commercial edition following in 1973. Actor Susannah Flood, who performs in the scene nightly, highlights the historical backdrop: ""They were growing up in a time where their doctors were male, gynecologists were male, obstetricians were male. There was no conversation about female anatomy that was considered polite. And they needed, as a way of taking agency… to get to know their bodies. So, they got naked."" , begins with palpable discomfort. One character remarks on the unsanitary nature of sitting in gym chairs. The ""assignment"" requires each woman to describe one thing they like and one thing they dislike about their body. The responses range from uproariously raunchy to deeply poignant. Margie, a character in her sixties played by Betsy Aidem, expresses her disdain for an unsightly C-section scar. ""It feels unfair somehow,"" she laments. ""Her children got life, her husband got the family he wanted, and I ended up this sad husk with this hideous scar."" Flood, whose character Lizzie serves as both protagonist and host, observes a fortunate convergence between the play’s theme of talking to each other and the palpable buzz within the audience each night – also, people talking to each other. A key reason for this heightened engagement is the theatre’s strict no-phone policy. Upon arrival, theatregoers must surrender their mobile phones, which are secured in special pouches that remain with them but can only be opened by staff. Without the distraction of emails or texts, genuine conversation flourishes. ""The real power of conversation – it’s a theme of the play,"" says Flood, whose character Lizzie travels through time to understand her mother’s choices. ""And because we have this scene where we all get naked, people have to surrender their cellphones. Honestly, I think that’s a huge reason the show has garnered the organic response it has."" The no-phone rule, clearly flagged on the show’s website, is rigorously enforced. One evening, a guard spotted a theatregoer scrolling during intermission, having neglected to secure her device. She was politely but firmly escorted to staff in the lobby to pouch the offending phone. Producer Daryl Roth notes that most attendees seem grateful for the reprieve from their devices. ""Over and above the nude scene, it’s a sense of freedom for the audience,"" Roth states. ""They can only think about this play right now. And isn’t that what we want? Come in for two and a half hours and give yourself over to what’s on the stage. It’s liberating."" theatregoer who attended with her book club, found herself ""much more attentive, immersed in the experience than if I’d had my phone with me."" She engaged in conversation with a stranger next to her, something she believes wouldn’t have happened if phones were present. Wohl even addresses the phone issue in her script, with Lizzie asking the audience before the action begins, ""They took your phones. Are we OK?"", which invariably earns a laugh. Beyond the phone ban, other precautions are taken; backstage monitors go black every night to prevent recordings or photos. Wohl believes this contributes to a deeper aspect of live theatre. ""It’s never going to happen again,"" she says of each night’s performance. ""You have to be in the room. And it’s very alive, for that reason."" The delicate process of staging the scene began during the very first rehearsals. Kelsey Rainwater, the production’s intimacy coordinator, describes it as ""its own miniplay."" She met with actors individually and led intensive rehearsals to choreograph movement. ""It was a really involved process,"" says Rainwater, who also teaches at She praises the exceptional sensitivity training provided to the security team. Rainwater calls the scene ""a huge ask"" for the actors, noting, ""It’s not just being nude onstage. They also have to talk about and draw attention to their bodies."" Rehearsals were conducted step-by-step, accommodating actors who needed a gradual approach and those who preferred to ""rip off the Band-Aid."" Wohl observes that each character, much like the actors, approaches the nudity exercise differently. ""That’s part of the complicated contradictions of feminism that I was trying to unpack in the play,"" she explains. One particularly interesting reaction came from her own father, who asked: ""Do women really talk to each other about their bodies like this?"" Audiences have been respectful, Rainwater confirms, though sometimes startled. ""On TV and film, there’s a bigger separation,"" she says. ""But when you’re breathing the same air, there’s definitely a reaction. Sometimes you feel a little bit like a voyeur. That’s part of the experience."" For the actors, repetition has brought comfort and confidence in the scene’s effectiveness. Flood now feels the scene is harder for the audience than for the performers. The show, which opened in late October, is scheduled to run until 1 February. Flood has come to realise that the truly daunting aspect is not the nudity itself, but the emotional vulnerability inherent in the acting. ""My parents were acting teachers, and they always said acting is controlled humiliation,"" she quips. ""So, is it any more humiliating than doing a scene you think is the most important thing on , and having someone fall asleep in the front row?"" An added benefit, she notes, is that for two hours, no one is distracted by a phone. ""People are really having a live experience, with other people, in the moment,"" Flood concludes. ""I think people are dying for that. They’re desperate for that, whether they’re aware of it or not.""",The Independent,The Independent

Read our ” a few weeks ago – and I wasn’t quite sure why. Up until now, I’ve always resisted the temptation to dress my 11-year-old , Muggles, in silly festive outfits like a pull-on elf hat. I admit, I’ve always secretly wanted to get him a Gucci reversible corduroy pet coat costing £570, but I didn’t want to make him the laughing stock of the neighbourhood by putting him in a humorous reindeer pet costume, a Santa hat with an elasticated chin strap, or in matchy-matchy Christmas PJs for the family. It just seemed so naff. Until now. As I dropped Muggles off for his biannual groom at the luxury pet store, Love My Human in London’s King’s Road, a regular haunt of and where he sells his freeze-dried raw dog food, I had a change of heart. It was the sight of all the soft alpaca dog Christmas jumpers – and Santa bandanas – that did it. As I was sitting a few doors down in their dog café waiting for Muggles, staring aimlessly at a dog menu with “loaded” puppuccinos, beef wellington, and dog ice cream, I thought to myself, “Go on, it’s Christmas. Why not?” The question was whether I could dress him up for Christmas day – but do it tastefully? I wandered back into the shop and picked him out a fabulously soft alpaca knit with a snowman design (£52.50), a great crocheted Christmas tree hat (from £35), and a traditional large red velvet festive Christmas bow (£18.50). I threw in a fresh seafood shrimp toy to complement his Christmas-themed outfit. I wanted him to look subtle and refined, not gimmicky. As Muggles returned upstairs from the grooming parlour looking like a fluffy white teddy bear rather than his usual matted, dirty sheep look, I got him dressed for Christmas. From that point on, everywhere I went, people stopped us in the street, saying, “Oh, he’s adorable,” and “Look at him, so cute!” Then I took him to meet my children, Lola, nine, and Liberty, seven. Their whole school swooned over his Christmas outfit. He lapped up the attention and seemed happily comfortable. I took off his jumper once we got home, so he didn’t overheat, and even snipped a few stitches around the neck so it was a looser fit for him. But according to Peta, this isn’t okay. The animal rights charity recently criticised Channel 4’s show presented by former Olympic diver Tom Daley, for putting knitted clothes on dogs at the risk of causing them “discomfort and stress”. In the hit show’s episode – “The Dog Apparel Challenge”, contestants had to create “iconic” but “practical” two-piece doggie outfits in 12 hours for two Italian greyhounds, who then modelled their new knitwear. The outfits included a neon orange coat and matching pom-pom hat, a rainbow sparkly coat and gold unicorn hat, a tailored red coat with a yellow and black beret, and a pink and white stripy number with a regal crown. Disapproving viewers online expressed their “disappointment” at Daley for being involved in such a degrading project. “As if any self-respecting, animal-caring dog owner would subject their canine to wearing these totally impractical outfits,” said one viewer. Elisa Allen, Peta’s vice president of programmes and operations, told Channel 4: “The only animals who should wear wool are sheep.” The campaigners also made it clear there should be a switch from using real wool to “natural, biodegradable plant wools” because the production of any animal-derived material, including wool, involves animal suffering and exploitation “Dogs aren't dolls, they are whole, intelligent individuals who should be respected for who they are,” Allen then told . “Putting clothes on them for our entertainment reduces them to laughable, lesser humans.” Putting a garment on a dog is acceptable only when it’s truly in their best interest, to “keep them warm or dry”. She added: “Garments can bother dogs, and cause them discomfort, stress and confusion”. But surely it’s harmless fun as long as the dog doesn’t mind it, and they don’t overheat? Of course I wouldn’t stick my dog in a ridiculous personalised pet cape with pom poms which meant that he could hardly walk, but a fun festive coats? Why not? I’m not alone in wanting to my dog to joing in the Christmas fun either. The pet fashion industry is booming, and is driven by consumers who increasingly view their pets as family members, just like I do. The global pet clothing market was valued at around £4.12bn in 2024 and is expected to reach over £5.52bn by 2030. King Charles has launched his own range of tweed jackets for dogs made exclusively at his Sandringham estate in Norfolk and crafted from Sandringham Royal Tweed with a brown collar and belt. I’m not alone in wanting to dress my dog in festive clobber, either. The pet fashion industry is booming, and is driven by consumers who increasingly view their pets as family members, just like I do.” The current M&S x Bella Freud collaboration, which also includes a lambswool blend dog jumper with the “Best Friend” slogan across the back, is a nod to the designer's trademark “1970” jumper and brings a new cool-dog level to canine fashion. And these days, twinning with your dog is as fun as doing it with your mini-me child at Trotters. That’s why Next sells matching chocolate brown Fair Isle knitted Christmas dog jumpers (£18) so that you can coordinate with them. Dogs are so much more than loyal companions. We give them blueberry facials, feed them special diets, and a recent study revealed that 54 per cent of dog owners regard their dog as a pseudo-child. On many levels, that has always been the case for me. Muggles was like a surrogate child; when I got him, I was desperate for a baby and in the midst of IVF. I sang lullabies to him and carried him around in a bag when he was a puppy. And like many other dog parents, I also suffer “dog guilt” just as strongly as “mum guilt” when I feel I’m not giving him the attention he deserves. A degree of anthropomorphism isn’t a bad thing. But the changing landscape of the dog-owner relationship means that we often attribute things to our dogs that are merely projections of ourselves – not how the dog really feels. While Muggles seems to be happy to be wearing a Christmas jumper, I also know that he hasn’t got a clue about why so much fuss is being made of it either. And he looks especially cute in he reindeer outfit I bought him. The brown cotton special made dog hoodie with cute antlers felt slightly less restrictive than the jumper – and easier to wash. In his reindeer form, I can’t walk down the road without people wanting to take selfies with him. Muggles looks adorable in his new festive outfits. But once Christmas is over, he’s going back to plain old Muggles and I’ll love him just the same.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/passive-income-polygamous-worker-careers-b2886369.html,The death of the career – why it’s now all about ‘passive income’ and the ‘polygamous worker’,2025-12-24T11:31:18.000Z,"onestly, sometimes I wonder whether I should have bothered trying to have a career at all,” Louise*, 37, is saying. For just over 15 years, to fulfil her ambitions in marketing – and she’s been more than successful. She’s dutifully put the hours and effort in as a strategist for brilliant big brands, teetering on the edge of her first creative director role – “That was always the aim,” she says. “But now I’m here, the world has changed. As galling as it is, in 2025, achieving your dreams That sounds very sad, I say, and without missing a beat, Louise begins explaining why I am right: “It is sad. I went into my career after uni like everyone else, thinking that I just had to work hard and it would pay off – buckle down, climb the ladder, all that. “It’s just not the case, though,” Louise continues. “On the slim chance you can get a house deposit together, you’re probably priced out by the mortgage anyway; companies make redundancies at the drop of a hat, probably because AI can do your job quicker and better. Living is so expensive that no one has the spare cash to invest in a private pension, and we’d be stupid to think that a state-funded pension will exist in another 30 years.” She pauses for breath. “You’ve got to take it into your own hands.” For some, that means being a so-called “polygamous worker” – a new cohort of staff taking salaries for multiple by abusing work-from-home culture. So many TikTok videos and websites teaching staff how to moonlight have now popped up that police are working with employers to crack down on fraudulent behaviour in the office; in April, one civil servant denied nine counts of fraud after being accused of holding down three different government For Louise, however, it means finding ways to create “passive ” – or, at least, find ways to safeguard or hijack their income that don’t rely on traditional work structures. It’s money made with little to no effort – or making money in your sleep. Technically, “passive income” is a business or trade that you don’t materially participate in. It’s different to a “side hustle” in that it’s not extra work you’re taking on – after the upfront labour and/or cost, the money should just gently roll in of its own accord. For the most part, passive income has always meant either having an investment portfolio of some sort, or a rental property that brings in cash – essentially, being wealthy. Now it’s taken on a whole new lease of life. Unsurprisingly, passive income is a saturated market – you don’t have to look too hard to see why. Most of us, like Louise, can rattle off the myriad reasons that life often feels quite a lot harder than we feel it ought to be. Many, quite justifiably, feel a bit tricked. And it’s not just like Louise. Gen X have also drawn a short straw at a different point of the career ladder – most have 10 or 20 years left before retirement from an ever-younger, AI-driven jobs market; much like , their skills and ideas have aged quicker against unprecedented advances in technology. , there was never any real question about the brittle nature of the job market – which is why they’ve gone about things in a different way. Rather than investing themselves in the 9-5 as the generations above them did wholeheartedly, they’ve earned a reputation as a cohort with a questionable work ethic. But that’s not necessarily the case: they are working hard, just not necessarily at the 9-5 job they have. They’re just as likely to refuse long hours in their 9-5 because it’s not their only job. Flexibility is key because they have grown up with the knowledge that jobs definitely aren’t for life. at all for their so-called bad attitudes at work,” Jen*, a 36-year-old friend living in east London, says. “What are they even working for? Where’s the reward?” Jen also achieved her “dream” of becoming a full-time writer by using multi-income streaming. Now, every time we meet for dinner, we exchange business ideas to fund our retirement. Her partner, a documentary maker, already uses an app, Getaround, to rent out his car when it’s not in use – the company has installed a device that allows users to open and lock it using their phone. He also rents out camera equipment in the same way. Both Jen and her partner put the money they’ve earned from these income streams into investment funds each month. Jen’s £200 direct debit from her salary goes into a long-term investment via an app called Nutmeg. It’s a risk – as all investments are – and she’s made losses along the way. But there have also been times when her passive income stream was almost £30k in profit. Making sure you’re investing wisely – even just using a stocks and shares ISA – is the most failsafe, common, low-effort way to make passive income, says Alex King, founder of Generation Money. King built a platform specifically to address the issues that have led to this surge in younger people seeking out alternative ways to be financially secure. Generation Money provides education and guidance to optimise savings and manage money better – something that very few of us feel confident in, or have ever been taught. “I think interest in all things personal finance has just increased over time,” says the 35-year-old, who spent more than a decade working in the finance sector. “More so than my parents’ generation – it used to be the case that if you went to university, you could be pretty much guaranteed a job for 30 years and then retire on a good pension. But, particularly since the financial crisis of 2008, that’s been upended. “Now, pensions are less secure, jobs are less secure, housing is less affordable, wages are more stagnant. Because of that, people have become more interested in how to be more financially independent. And Gen-Zers don’t have that same mindset as previous generations, dutifully working nine to five. In some cases, they’re dubbed as seeing themselves turning up for work as doing the company a favour. To be honest, I kind of respect them.” The thing is, everyone feels that their own generation has been hard done by – but now, the global economy, the jobs market, the ripple effects of the Covid pandemic, the Ukraine-Russian war, the cost of living crisis and successive governments scrabbling over growing national debt means that, basically, in some way, everyone is right. “Many people have a sense of unfairness within their generation,” says King. “And so, looking at ways of bringing in passive income, starting a side hustle, or learning how to invest or trade makes them feel they can get ahead of a less-than-ideal situation.” Add to that mix the growing, very real threat of AI, and all bets are off. AI has the potential to significantly reduce the number of jobs in any market, and eradicate some entirely. And while it’s not exactly an imminent change, it’s certainly not abstract. If anything, it only gives credence to the idea that the traditional career route is insecure – and makes the idea of utilising several passive income streams even more appealing. Unsurprisingly, that means there is a lot of snake oil being sold as passive income. On TikTok, YouTube and Instagram, making stacks of passive income appears, quite frankly, to be a doddle. Users in their droves post about their enormously profitable schemes from which they claim to make sometimes thousands of pounds per month – either selling ebooks or pre-written courses, buying vending machines (yes really), using “dropshipping” (where a third-party supplier sends products directly to the customer) to sell notebooks, T-shirts, mugs. Others advise setting up multiple YouTube channels using popular keywords like “white noise” or using affiliate marketing links on your social media. The passive income influencers – or “finfluencers” (financial influencers) – are, ironically, cashing in on the buzz with the thousands of views they’re getting paid for. While being very online can be a legitimate source of passive income, renting out assets you already own can also bring in hundreds per month. One acquaintance rents out the caravan on his drive for £45 a day/night (and it’s surprisingly popular, especially with a local neighbour who uses it to “escape her kids”); other people rent out their driveway or parking space to earn extra income. Renting out a spare room can bring a bonus of up to £7,500 per year, tax-free. There are also sites like Swimple, where the wealthy rent out their private pools. While not strictly passive income, many people use sites like Cat in a Flat, where you get paid to stay in someone else’s house to look after their cat and can make more than £100 in one weekend – and more in the week (great for those who can work from anywhere). The “dodgy influencers on social media”, as King calls them, who are often found selling courses on how to make passive income, “can be quite predatory”, he warns. “There’s definitely an element of being very careful about signing up. If these income streams, like buying vending machines, for example, were really making them so much money, would they be telling thousands and thousands more people about it? No,” says King. Basically, use your noggin: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. But, done right, passive income – and more education on how to make it work – could be much more than a status symbol. It could begin to democratise financial stability. For most people, whether you’re starting out in your career or nearing retirement in a grim, depleted jobs market, it’s not just a bit of extra cash in your pocket but a way to feel more in control in a world that’s unsteady at best. For Louise, taking things into her own hands meant completing a short course on how to invest and then setting up a little portfolio, as well as registering her flat on a site where TV and film directors scout filming locations. It’s not exactly making money in your sleep, “but,” she says, “it’s money in my pocket that’s more reliable than my next pay rise. The world’s my oyster again,” she laughs.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Leading medical bodies representing more than 90,000 health professionals have issued an urgent plea for pregnant women to receive their Despite a slight slowdown in the rate of growth, an average of were occupying hospital beds daily, according to the latest data. This figure surpasses admissions from the same period in the previous two years, underscoring the ongoing pressure on health services. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to severe complications from the flu, with data indicating they are more likely than the general population to experience adverse outcomes, while their babies face an increased risk of hospitalisation. In response, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have united to stress the critical importance of vaccination. They advise women to consult their maternity teams or offers vital protection even later into the flu season. Dr Alison Wright, president of the RCOG, emphasised the vaccine’s efficacy and safety. ""Having the flu vaccine during pregnancy is the most effective way to protect women and their babies from getting seriously unwell with flu,"" she stated. ""This vaccine is safe, and boosts maternal antibodies against flu, which are passed on to the baby before birth for maximum protection. It is not too late to get vaccinated."" Dr Wright further urged all healthcare professionals to actively recommend vaccination to pregnant women at every opportunity. Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, acknowledged the overwhelming amount of information women receive during pregnancy but highlighted the vaccine as a clear priority. ""One of the simplest and most effective steps a woman can take to protect both herself and her baby is to have the flu vaccine if she hasn’t already,"" she explained. Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include: ""It provides the strongest protection throughout pregnancy and significantly reduces the risk of becoming seriously unwell or needing hospital care."" Ms Walton added that midwives are a trusted source of advice, ready to discuss any concerns about vaccinations, including safety, and confirmed the vaccine’s safety at all stages of pregnancy, noting its protective benefits for babies in their vulnerable first months. Professor Steve Turner, president of the RCPCH, warned against underestimating the virus, particularly for children. ""Many people are mistaken in believing that flu is simply a bad ,"" he said. ""The flu virus can cause very serious infections with lifelong implications for children, and especially infants."" Professor Turner stressed that these infections and subsequent hospital admissions are placing immense strain on the NHS, but are largely preventable through vaccination. The RCPCH has published a flu vaccine factsheet to support parents and carers, Oliver Picard, chair of the National Pharmacy Association, confirmed widespread availability of the vaccine. ""Most independent pharmacies are telling us they still have good stock availability and are able to vaccinate patients promptly,"" he said. He joined the Royal Colleges in urging all at-risk groups to get vaccinated, reiterating that flu can cause severe illness and pose risks to unborn babies. He encouraged individuals to seek a quick and almost painless jab at their local pharmacy or GP practice.",The Independent,The Independent

The ‘slayer rule’ might play a role,2025-12-24T11:52:41.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our of filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner and his wife, the photographer and producer Michele Singer Reiner, have sparked widespread grieving. This tragedy, discovered on Dec. 14, 2025, is also increasing the public’s interest in what happens when killers could inherit wealth from their victims. That’s because Nick Reiner, their son, of first-degree murder four days after the couple’s deaths at their Los Angeles home. All states have some form of a slayer rule that prevents killers from . While the rules differ slightly from state to state, they always bar murderers from profiting from their own crimes. Simply put, if you’re found guilty of killing someone or plead guilty to their murder, you can’t inherit anything from your victim’s estate. and apply to jointly held property, insurance policies and other kinds of accounts. Most of these slayer rules, including California’s, apply only to “felonious and intentional” killings, meaning that they don’t apply if you accidentally kill someone. Although there doesn’t have to be a guilty verdict by a judge or a jury, or a guilty plea from the accused, there must be some finding by a criminal or civil court of an intentional and felonious killing. These rules, known as slayer rules, have a long history in the United States. They became more prominent following an 1889 murder case in New York state, in which a 16-year-old boy poisoned his grandfather to get an inheritance that was written into his grandfather’s will. It’s hard to say for sure. As far as we know, nobody’s tried to keep track. Slayer rules come into play whenever someone who would otherwise inherit assets from an estate is convicted of or found liable for murder, and the slayer is entitled to inherit from the victim. committed by relatives. Many of the high-profile ones have been tied to murders that occurred in California. Famous disinherited murderers include Lyle and Erik Menendez, the Californians known as the Menendez brothers. In 1996, a jury found them guilty of the first-degree murder of their , José and Mary Louise “Kitty” Menendez. The Menendez brothers’ parents, who were killed in 1989, had a fortune that today would be worth more than $35 million. The brothers, who became eligible for parole but were denied it in 2025, have been in prison ever since. Once there has been a finding of an intentional and felonious killing, even if the slayer is later released on parole – or even if they serve no prison time at all – they would still not inherit anything. In practical terms, that means if one or both of the Menendez brothers were to win parole in the future, they would still be ineligible to inherit any of their parents’ wealth upon their release from prison. California’s slayer rule also meant that salesman Scott Peterson, who was convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci Peterson, in 2002, couldn’t collect the money he would otherwise have been due from her life insurance policy. In the absence of a murder conviction, the slayer rule may not apply. For example, a conviction for a lesser criminal offense, such as manslaughter, might allow the accused – or their lawyers – to argue that the killing was unintentional. This exception could be relevant to the prosecution of the Reiners’ murders if it were to turn out that Nick Reiner’s defense can show that substance abuse or schizophrenia rendered him insane when he allegedly killed his parents at their Los Angeles home. On the other hand, under California law, even if there is no conviction the probate court administering the murder victim’s estate could still separately find that the killing was intentional and felonious. That civil finding would bar the slayer from inheriting without a criminal conviction. Slayer rules apply to anyone who kills one or more of their relatives, whether their victims were rich, poor or in between. When large amounts of money are at stake, cases tend to garner more attention due to media coverage during the criminal trial and subsequent inheritance litigation. It’s too soon for both the public and the family to know who will inherit what from the Reiners. Wills are typically public documents, although the Reiners may have also engaged in other types of estate planning, such as trusts, that do not typically become public records. And celebrities with valuable intellectual property rights, such as copyrights from the Reiners’ many film and television properties, tend to establish trusts. Assuming that, like many parents, the Reiners left most of their fortune – which reportedly was worth some US$200 million – to their children, including Nick, then California’s slayer statute may come into play. The couple had two other children together, Romy and Jake. Rob Reiner also had another daughter, Tracy Reiner, whom he adopted after his marriage to his first wife, the actor and filmmaker Penny Marshall. Naomi Cahn is a professor of law at the University of Virginia and Reid Kress Weisbord is a distinguished professor of law and Judge Norma Shapiro Scholar at Rutgers University - Newark. This article is republished from It’s also likely that the Reiners included charitable bequests in their estate plans. They were strong supporters of many causes, including early childhood development. It is important to emphasize that the wills and other estate planning documents of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner have not yet been made public. That means what Nick Reiner might stand to inherit, if the slayer rule were to prove irrelevant in this case, is unknown. Nor, with the investigation of the couple’s deaths still underway, can anyone make any assumptions about Nick’s innocence or guilt. And, as of mid-December 2025, an unnamed source was telling entertainment reporters that Nick Reiner’s legal bills were being paid for by the Reiner family.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our When you’re shopping for a high-quality vehicle, the idea of acquiring one with a luxury badge that’s packed with features can be appealing. But it can also be an expensive proposition in today’s market when the average price of a new car is approximately $50,000. Thankfully, there is an alternative: Buy a used one. The experts at Edmunds know there are plenty of great used luxury vehicles that you can easily get for less than $40,000. These are five of their favorites that deliver a refined driving experience and superior comfort and technology features compared to more mainstream vehicles. Smooth and powerful engines and sporty handling make the 3 Series a fun-to-drive means of transportation. When considering a used model, know that this seventh-generation version rolled into BMW dealerships for the 2019 model year. It brought added power from the standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine, improved handling and a slightly larger trunk. Rear-wheel drive is standard, although all-wheel drive is available as an option to provide better traction in winter weather. Look for: You’ll find the sporty M340i and even the plug-in hybrid 330e on dealer lots. But getting a 2022 to 2024 base 330i is the easiest way to stay below $40,000. Look for one that came equipped with the car’s helpful — but optional at the time — advanced driver aids, such as adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance. Introduced beginning with the 2020 model year, the Mercedes-Benz GLB is a savvy choice for a subcompact luxury SUV. Initially, it was available solely with a 221-horsepower four-cylinder engine and front- or all-wheel drive. In 2021, Mercedes added a sportier 302-horsepower variant called the AMG GLB 35. Additional highlights include a roomy cabin and good outward visibility. There is an optional third row, though keep in mind it’s tiny and only suitable for small kids. Look for: We think you’ll be pleased with the performance, high economy and smooth ride of the regular GLB 250. You’ll find plenty of used 2023 and 2024 models for under $40,000. Similar to the 3 Series, make sure to get a used GLB that has the vehicle’s optional advanced driver aids. The Genesis GV70 is a small five-seat SUV that’s big on style and content. Having made its debut for the 2022 model year, this first-generation GV70 looks sharp and gets down the road quickly thanks to its choice of a 300-horsepower four-cylinder engine or an available 375-horsepower V6. The V6, in particular, provides the GV70 with impressive acceleration for merging onto the highway or passing slower vehicles. All GV70s feature an attractive cabin, numerous standard features, and a spacious cargo area. Look for: You’ll find plenty of 2022 and 2023 GV70s for under $40,000. A 2.5T designation means the GV70 has the four-cylinder engine, while 3.5T means it has the V6. The Acura MDX will appeal to you if you want a versatile luxury SUV with three rows of seating. It also comes with the surprise of being sporty and comfortable at the same time. A redesign for the 2022 model year brought a more energetic-looking exterior, more legroom for all three rows, and improved technology features. The base engine is a 290-horsepower V6 and offers a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. A punchier 335-horsepower Type S model is available, yet used models could be significantly more expensive. Look for: You should have no trouble tracking down a 2022 MDX for under $40,000. We recommend the MDX A-Spec trim level for its sportier styling and appealing collection of convenience and technology features. For a true family hauler, check out the Buick Enclave. Straddling the line between mainstream and luxury brands, the Enclave comes with the benefit of delivering more SUV for your money than a rival with a more upscale badge. An all-new Enclave came out for the 2025 model year, but you’ll want to look at the previous-generation model produced from 2018 to 2024. Edmunds found this older version to be stylish and highly capable of hauling people, cargo, or a combination of the two. Look for: Aim for a 2023 or 2024 Enclave. You’ll find plenty of for-sale Enclaves in the midlevel trim. That’s a great way to go because it comes with some desirable extras, such as ventilated front seats and a premium sound system, that the base Essence trim lacks. Wanting a luxury label on a used vehicle doesn’t have to be a budget-busting proposition. The right pick can bring added pride of ownership and many miles of driving pleasure.

Read our Vegan beauty is arguably at its best phase yet. Once associated with bland packaging and hit-or-miss formulas, vegan  products today rival – and often outperform – their traditional counterparts. The definition of vegan is “a product has no animal ingredients and no animal-derived products, [which is] also cruelty free – so no animal testing,” explains the Vegan Society’s Karen Spinner, head of sales and marketing at the Vegan Trademark. But Spinner says just because a product is cruelty-free doesn’t mean it’s vegan. Lots of animal derivatives are used in the beauty industry. Common ingredients that can catch people out include “squalene, that’s an extract of shark’s liver, you’ll often find in deodorants, lip balms and moisturisers. “Ambergris, which comes from fat of the intestine of the sperm whale – that’s used in the perfume industry,” Spinner explains. [are] vanilla perfumes. It’s very trendy at the moment, and lots of vanilla perfumes have a have an animal by product called castoreum, which is secreted from the castor sacs of beavers. “Then obviously you’ve got cochineal, which is for pigment, created by crushing insects – you find that in lots of lipsticks, blushes and nail polishes.” If you’re planning on dipping your toe into veganism this , the best vegan products are those you wouldn’t even realise are fully plant-based and cruelty-free. So, here are the vegan beauty staples worth making room for in 2026. Good skin underpins beauty today, with some of the biggest trends like ‘glass skin’ and ‘hazy cheeks’ relying on the health and vibrance of bare skin. And luckily, some of the most effective formulas on the market are entirely vegan. Aesop is often associated with luxurious self-care, but many consumers don’t realise that its also vegan, Leaping Bunny-approved and certified B Corp. The Parsley Seed Facial Cleanser is one of the brand’s most enduring formulas, designed with urban living in mind. and daily pollution without stripping the skin barrier – something that’s particularly important for combination or city-stressed complexions. Rich in antioxidant botanicals, it leaves skin feeling balanced – not tight – making it a reliable everyday option for those who want effective plant-based cleansing without overcomplicating their routine. Medik8 is a science-led skincare brand trusted by beauty lovers and dermatologists alike – and many users may not even realise its formulas are vegan. Certified vegan by the Vegan Society, Medik8 is a science-based skincare brand, and one of its bestsellers is the daily moisturiser. It’s non-comedogenic, meaning it doesn’t clog pores, and is suitable for both dry and oily skin types thanks to its perfected combination of prebiotic peptides, ceramides and lipids for ultimate hydration without excess grease. Base make-up has historically been the hardest category for vegan beauty to get right. But more recently, vegan formulas are being perfected due to consumer demand. “The vegan society’s own research carried out in 2021 found that 40% of the women in the UK who always buy vegan beauty aren’t actually vegan,” Spinner says, showing the growth in conscious consumerism. Not all Ultrasun products are vegan, as many of their lip products contain beeswax, however this tinted fluid is vegan and the perfect base all year round. A rare hybrid that delivers broad-spectrum sun protection alongside sheer, skin-evening coverage. Lightweight and non-greasy, it works well for everyday wear and is especially useful if you prefer minimal makeup with maximum protection. Merit has built its reputation around pared-back, skin-first make-up that prioritises ease and wearability. The Minimalist Complexion Stick reflects that ethos perfectly, sitting somewhere between a concealer and a foundation. The creamy vegan formula blends effortlessly with fingers or a brush, offering buildable coverage that still looks like skin. Ideal for evening out redness, dark circles or blemishes, it still has a natural pay-off looking light and unfussy. Vegan formulas no longer compromise on pigment or longevity, and some of 2025’s best eye products were in fact vegan. , the influencer-slash-YouTuber founded beauty brand, Vieve has made waves this year. Launched in 2020 by Jamie Genevieve, Vieve has created viral products including its balmy foundation hybrid and its eye products. The Vieve mascara is a standout, it delivers volume and definition without flaking or stiffness. The formula builds well, making it suitable for both natural daytime looks and fuller evening lashes, without drying out over time. E.l.f Cosmetics is an old-school vegan brand, which is double-certified cruelty free by both PETA and Leaping Bunny. It’s cream eyeshadow is a practical, long-wearing shadow that delivers colour in one swipe. It sets quickly without creasing, making it reliable for fast routines or long days when you don’t want to think about touch-ups. Made and manufactured in the south of England, Grove England is a hidden gem for luxury vegan body care. However, it’s important to note that while they claim vegan status, they don’t prominently display a third-party certification logo (like Vegan Society or Leaping Bunny), so it is still important to check the ingredients list and manufacturing information of their products. This neroli and cedarwood scented body wash however is vegan according to its ingredients, and contains antioxidants, vitamin B5 and amino acids which leaves skin nourished and radiant. Aromatica is a K-beauty brand that has boomed in popularity this year. All their ingredients are all ECOCERT certified, vegan-friendly and are not tested on animals. This body lotion is one of their hero products, it leaves the body hydrated thanks to its pure shea butter, while the vegan formula means it absorbs well – even on damp skin – without leaving a sticky or greasy residue. Recent years has seen a rise in demand for vegan beauty products, mainly due to rising ethical concerns, health consciousness (as people are becoming more aware of how processed animal products react with the skin) and environmental awareness. “Over 52% of [the Vegan Society’s] market is cosmetics and beauty,” says Spinner, “people always think food when they think vegan, but actually cosmetics, beauty and personal care is the biggest market for us.” It seems that now is as better time than any to test out some vegan beauty products, starting with easy swaps such as a beeswax lip balm with a candelilla wax balm. Swaps don’t have to be a compromise, and in many cases, they can actually be an upgrade.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our have said they hope the decision not to bring criminal charges following a police investigation into chants made at Glastonbury Festival “inspires others in the UK and around the world to speak up” about Palestine.

Shortly afterwards, following a backlash at the performance, which was live streamed on said a criminal investigation was under way with a senior detective appointed to lead the investigation. In a statement released on Tuesday, the force said: “No further action will be taken on the basis there is insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction.” On Christmas Eve, in a statement posted to X, Bob Vylan said: “The arrival of the news that no further action will be taken against any member of Bob Vylan regarding our Glastonbury performance in June 2025, should be something we as a band find celebration in. “But the fact is, the criminal investigation of the chant was never warranted in the first place. “Over the past 6 months, the media and politicians have consistently attacked us for using our art and platform to take a stand against the actions of Israel and its illegal occupying military force. “For the past 6 months, Avon and Somerset Police have investigated a small segment of a performance that was evidently not hateful, but was a display of solidarity with the Palestinian people.” The statement added: “We hope that this news inspires others in the UK and around the world to speak up, and continue speaking up, in support of the Palestinian people, without fear. “We have had our shows cancelled, visas revoked, our names tarnished and our lives upended, but what we have lost in peace and security, we have gained tenfold in spirit and camaraderie. “Thank you to everybody that has supported us in any way throughout the attempts to silence us, it has been beautiful to feel such community gather around.” (CST), a charity which provides protection for Jewish communities in the UK, told the Press Association: “It is incredibly disappointing that the police and CPS have decided not to charge in this case, particularly when police forces in London and Manchester are adopting a stronger approach to tackling hateful rhetoric. “It sends completely the wrong message at the worst possible time.” In a post on X, the embassy of Israel in London also criticised the decision by Avon and Somerset Police. It said: “It is deeply disappointing that vile calls for violence, repeated openly and without remorse, continue to fall on deaf ears. Especially in the wake of the terror attacks in Manchester and Bondi, when will such calls finally be recognised for what they are: a real and dangerous instigator of bloodshed?” A statement from Avon and Somerset added: “The comments made on Saturday June 28 drew widespread anger, proving that words have real-world consequences. “We believe it is right this matter was comprehensively investigated, every potential criminal offence was thoroughly considered and we sought all the advice we could to ensure we made an informed decision.” A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Tuesday: “We provided early investigative advice to Avon and Somerset Police on what evidence might be needed to meet the legal test for charging but we have not been asked to make a charging decision in this case. “A number of offences were considered which each have evidential requirements to prove but Avon and Somerset Police have concluded there is insufficient evidence for there to be any realistic prospect of conviction and will take no further action.” Bob Vylan, comprised of singer Robinson-Foster and drummer Wade Laurence George, are known for writing songs that criticise the British establishment and were dropped from a number of festivals and performances following their Glastonbury appearance in the summer.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/dementia-alzheimers-symptoms-high-fat-cheese-b2890086.html,These two foods could reduce your dementia risk. Here’s what we know,2025-12-24T12:23:49.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our among middle-aged and older adults who consumed higher amounts of full-fat cheese and cream. The findings may sound like welcome news, but they need careful interpretation. The study followed 27,670 participants for 25 years, during which 3,208 developed . Among people without a known genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, eating more than 50 grams of full-fat cheese per day was associated with a 13%–17% lower risk of Alzheimer’s. No such reduction was seen among people who carried genetic risk factors for the disease. Consuming more than 20 grams of full-fat cream per day was linked to a 16%–24% lower risk of dementia overall. No associations were found for low-fat or high-fat milk, fermented or non-fermented milk, or low-fat cream. These findings are notable given longstanding public health advice to choose low-fat dairy to reduce cardiovascular risk. This matters because heart disease and dementia share many risk factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. When evidence from previous studies is combined, analyses suggest that cheese consumption may also be linked to a lower risk of heart disease, and that full-fat dairy does not necessarily increase cardiovascular risk. Several other studies have explored whether similar patterns apply to brain health, but the results are mixed. Evidence overall suggests that studies conducted in Asian populations are more likely to report benefits of dairy consumption for cognitive health, while many European studies do not. One possible explanation is that average dairy intake tends to be much lower in Asian countries, meaning modest consumption may have different effects than higher intakes. For example, one Japanese study reported a reduced dementia risk among people who ate cheese, but overall consumption levels were very low and the research was sponsored by a cheese producer. In contrast, another Japanese study funded by government grants found no protective effect of cheese. Some long-term European studies have also reported benefits. In a Finnish study of 2,497 middle-aged men followed for 22 years, cheese was the only food associated with a lower dementia risk, reduced by 28%. Consumption of milk and processed red meat was linked to poorer performance on cognitive tests, while fish consumption was associated with better outcomes. A large UK study following nearly 250,000 people found that eating fish two to four times a week, fruit daily and cheese once a week was associated with lower dementia risk. However, these studies have important limitations. What people eat is usually self-reported, and changes in memory can affect both eating habits and how accurately people remember what they have eaten. To deal with this, the Swedish researchers took two extra steps. First, they excluded anyone who already had dementia when the study began. Then they repeated the same calculations after removing people who went on to develop dementia within the first ten years of the study. This did not mean starting the study again or recruiting new participants. It simply meant re-checking the results using a smaller group of people who remained dementia-free for longer. The reason for doing this is that the early stages of dementia can subtly change behaviour long before diagnosis. People may eat differently, lose their appetite or struggle to recall their usual diet. By focusing on participants who stayed cognitively healthy for many years, the researchers reduced the chance that these early changes were influencing the results. Eef Hogervorst is a Professor of Biological Psychology at Loughborough University. Another important question is whether substitution played a role. Some of the apparent benefits may reflect replacing red or processed meat with cheese or cream, rather than an effect of dairy itself. Supporting this idea, the Swedish study found no association between full-fat dairy and dementia risk among participants whose diets remained stable over five years. Most importantly, foods should not be considered in isolation. Dietary patterns matter more than individual ingredients. Diets such as the Mediterranean diet, which is consistently associated with lower risks of both dementia and heart disease, include cheese alongside vegetables, fish, whole grains and fruit. In the Swedish study, people who consumed more full-fat cheese and cream were also more educated, less likely to be overweight and had lower rates of conditions linked to dementia, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes. All of these factors independently reduce dementia risk. Different types of dementia can affect people differently, and everyone will experience symptoms in their own way. This suggests that higher cheese intake tended to occur within healthier overall lifestyles, rather than alongside excess calorie consumption or poor metabolic health. Overall, the evidence does not support the idea that full-fat dairy causes dementia, nor that fermented milk products reliably protect against it. Full-fat cheese contains several nutrients relevant to brain health, including fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K2, as well as vitamin B12, folate, iodine, zinc and selenium. These nutrients play roles in neurological function and may help support cognitive health. That said, the data do not justify eating large amounts of cheese or cream as protective foods against dementia or heart disease. The most consistent message remains that balanced diets, moderation and overall lifestyle matter far more than any single item on the cheese board.",The Independent,The Independent

A rocket came through the roof, which has since been rebuilt, but the cross that stands atop the front facade remains untouched. “That was a very big sign for us as well – they couldn’t break the cross,” Father Ferrero said. “When the bombs are strong and near, the house shakes like in an earthquake. I don’t know if you have experienced earthquakes, but I have, and it shakes like an earthquake, but the church seems to be standing very strongly.” When asked if he felt divine intervention played a part in the building’s survival, he replied: “God is always there.” Since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities. Two years ago, there were 140 Catholics living in the strip, within a mixed Christian community of around 1,000, including Lutherans, Orthodox and Baptists. Now only 90 Catholics remain, and fears for the future continue despite a US-brokered ceasefire that began two months ago. “Since the agreement, every day we hear shootings and bombings,” Father Ferrero said. “Every day, every night, during the day, any time. But not as many or as much as before, you understand, so... people can move a little more freely than before.” Father Ferrero entered the war-torn strip in the middle of the conflict last year as part of a pastoral trip organised by Jerusalem Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa in which he and Father Romanelli were both given permission to stay. Yet, despite the ceasefire, Father Ferrero remains reticent about the prospect of peace in “For us who are inside here, it is not clear how long it will take, what is the intention, how much good will they have really. We don’t see any machines coming to clear the rubble. “There’s no intention to go to the second phase of the agreement. We hope it will happen. We pray that it will happen, and as much as we can, we ask everybody to push that way. But we are not sure about the future really.” As war has raged, the church transformed from a place for worship and education to a refuge, and up to 400 refugees continue to stay. Last June, it was forced to close its school, considered one of the best in Gaza, due to relentless of the neighbourhood. Classrooms were transformed into sanctuaries for the refugees, with 12 to 15 people staying inside each room. The school has since reopened, much to the joy of parents in the local area looking for a semblance of normality, but despite the ceasefire, there continues to be very little aid brought into Gaza. “The help comes in but very little,” said Father Ferrero. “It’s not enough for the whole population. And something that strikes me really is that for business, there are things, for buying and selling, there are items, but for giving out relief, it is not arriving the same way. Maybe in the south there is more, but I live in Gaza City. When we get something that is bigger, we distribute [it] among the people around us in the neighbourhoods,” he added. “The people know that. So it’s not so easy, but everybody tries to cooperate.” After two years of conflict and an uncertain future, the church’s will be a toned-down affair. Before the war, they used to put up a big tree outside the front. Last year, they didn’t put one up and Father Ferrero had expressed doubt that they would do it this year due to the ongoing suffering. However, pictures from Zeitoun showed Palestinian parishioners putting up a large “We try to keep everything as normal as possible because that gives us hope. That keeps the spirit up, you know. So we need to do our best.... Christmas is always Christmas.” would call fellow priest Father Romanelli every night during the war. Pope Leo XIV, who took up the papacy from Francis, has been in contact with the Gazan congregation and continues to show his support, albeit not as often. “He’s not calling every day because that was really extraordinary,” Father Ferrero said. “The pope is new and has so many things to deal with that we understand very well he cannot be calling us every day. But he is in touch.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our such as eating well and exercising. Normal routines disappear, days become less structured and habits can fade. The solution to staying active is not more willpower, but smarter planning. Research shows that simple, practical strategies can help people stay active through At this time of year, articles often focus on the calorie content of festive foods and drinks, alongside advice on how to “burn off” festive indulgence. However, guilt-based You are more likely to stick with exercise when it feels rewarding rather than forced. This is known as intrinsic motivation, which comes from enjoying the activity itself, rather than exercising due to pressure, guilt or external rewards. Behaviour change research shows that physical activity habits are more likely to last when they are easy to start and driven by intrinsic motivation. For example, someone is more likely to maintain a running habit because it improves their mood or helps them decompress, rather than because they are trying to burn a specific number of calories. To support intrinsic motivation, it helps to choose activities you enjoy or are curious about and avoid rigid rules. Exercises should match your current ability and offer a sense of progress, such as improvements in strength, technique or stamina. Clear, achievable progress increases enjoyment and commitment. Training with others, joining group classes or sharing progress can also help sustain motivation. Most people do not stop exercising over Christmas because they lose motivation. Instead, their routines change. Late nights, travel, disrupted schedules, limited gym access or exercising in unfamiliar places create practical barriers. In many cases, exercise habits fade because of logistics, not a lack of desire. In behavioural science, anything that makes a behaviour harder to start than it needs to be is described as friction. Even small obstacles can increase the effort, time or mental energy required to begin, making people more likely to delay or abandon the behaviour. Friction is often subtle. Forgetting login details for a fitness app, not knowing what workout to do, or wondering whether there is enough time for a session to be “worth it” can be enough to derail exercise plans. Each small obstacle adds hesitation and increases the chance of giving up. Reducing friction makes it far easier to maintain fitness over Christmas. This can be done by preparing in advance, simplifying choices and making the first step as easy as possible. Preparing ahead of time reduces delays and procrastination. Keep a gym bag packed or lay out workout clothes the night before. If you train with music or podcasts, have them ready. Create a default route for outdoor activities such as running or cycling so you don’t have to decide where to go. When routines change, the type of exercise often needs to change too. Many people turn to social media or YouTube for ideas, but the sheer number of options can lead to decision fatigue, where repeated choices drain mental energy and make it more likely that exercise is postponed altogether. To avoid this, bookmark a small number of go-to workouts on your phone and label them by duration and location. For example: Choose workouts for the week in advance where possible. Use a fixed rotation of three or four sessions, such as full-body strength, a 30-minute run, then full-body strength again. Limiting options reduces decision fatigue and makes starting easier. When time is limited or the gym is busy, effective workouts can still be completed in under 30 minutes using time-efficient training methods. In the gym, instead of resting between sets on one machine, move between exercises that target different muscle groups. For example, rotate between chest press, seated row, leg press, shoulder press, lat pulldown and a core exercise. If equipment is unavailable, substitute with a similar movement using dumbbells or bodyweight. Pair exercises that work different muscle groups and perform them back to back, such as a dumbbell chest press followed by a chest-supported row. After completing a set, reduce the weight by 20% to 30% and continue until fatigue. Repeat for two to four drops. Choose a weight you can lift for 12 to 15 repetitions. After the first set, rest briefly, then perform mini sets of three to five repetitions, rest for 20 seconds. Keep going until until you can’t complete 3 reps. Drop sets and myo reps are effective for muscle growth. For maximum strength goals, traditional or cluster sets are more appropriate. Paul Hough is a Lecturer in Sport & Exercise Physiology at the University of Westminster. Metabolic conditioning involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise that challenge both muscles and the cardiovascular system. It is particularly useful when time is limited. Plan a circuit of several exercises. Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds then move to the next exercise. Rest for one to two minutes after completing all the exercises and repeat for multiple rounds. At the start of each minute, complete a set number of repetitions and rest for the remainder of the minute before starting the next exercise. Alternate 20 seconds of high-intensity exercise with ten seconds of rest. Complete eight intervals (one block), then rest for two to three minutes. Repeat this for two to three blocks. Select four or five exercises with target reps for each exercise. Set a timer for 12 to 20 minutes and cycle through the exercises continuously, aiming to complete as many rounds as possible. Even during the disruption of the festive season, it is possible to stay active. Skipping exercise entirely until January risks losing fitness and breaking momentum. Evidence-based strategies that reduce friction and make exercise easy to start are far more effective than relying on willpower. By keeping workouts simple and accessible, you can maintain fitness through Christmas without having to start again in the new year.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Thousands of people flocked to Bethlehem's Manger Square on Christmas Eve as crowds of families and music and decorations heralded a much-needed boost of Christmas spirit after two years of war-tinged somber celebrations. The giant Christmas tree that was absent during the Israel-Hamas war returned on Wednesday, overlooking a parade of hundreds of smartly dressed scouts playing well-known Christmas songs on bagpipes. believe Jesus was born cancelled Christmas celebrations for the past two years during the war in Gaza, holding muted celebrations few decorations or lights or festive events. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the top Catholic leader in the Holy Land, kicked off Christmas celebrations during the traditional procession from to Bethlehem, calling for “a Christmas full of light.” “After two years of darkness, we need light,” Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, said as he crossed the separation wall that divides Jerusalem from Bethlehem. Arriving in Manger Square, Pizzaballa said he came bearing greetings from Gaza's tiny Christian community, where he held a pre-Christmas Mass on Sunday. But among the devastation, he also saw a desire for life and to rebuild. “We, all together, we decide to be the light, and the light of Bethlehem is the light of the world,” he told thousands of people, Christian and Muslim, who gathered in the square. Despite Wednesday's holiday cheer, the impact of the war in the i-occupied West Bank is acute, especially in Bethlehem, where around 80% of the Muslim-majority city’s residents depend upon tourism-related businesses, according to the local government. The vast majority of people celebrating Wednesday were local residents, with only a handful of foreigners mixed among the crowd. But some residents said they are starting to see some small signs of change as domestic tourism slowly returns and hopefully will herald the return of international visitors the city depends on. “Today is a day of joy, a day of hope, the beginning of the return of normal life here,” said Bethlehem resident Georgette Jackaman, a tour guide who has not worked in more than two years. “ are desperate, but after two years, everyone wants to celebrate.” She and her husband, Michael Jackaman, another guide who is out of work, are from established Christian Bethlehem families that stretch back generations. This is the first real Christmas celebration for their two children, aged 2 1/2 and 10 months. During the war, the Jackamans pivoted to create a website selling Palestinian handicrafts to try to support others who also have lost their livelihoods. Christmas and religious pilgrims always have been a prime economic engine for Bethlehem. During the Gaza war, the unemployment rate in the city jumped from 14% to 65%, Bethlehem Mayor Maher Nicola Canawati said earlier this month. “People are still afraid to come visit,” said Georgette Jackaman. “But if people come here, we can breathe a bit of the world, even if we are living with restrictions.” “I came because I wanted to better understand what people in Palestine are going through, and you can sense people have been through a very hard time,” said Mona Riewer, a physiotherapist from France. Although friends and family abroad cautioned her against coming due to the volatile situation, Riewer said being in Bethlehem to mark Christmas helped her appreciate the meaning of the holiday. “Christmas is like hope in very dark situations, a very vulnerable child experiencing harshness,” she said. Despite the ceasefire that began in October, tensions remain high across much of the West Bank. Israel’s military continues to carry out frequent raids in what it says is a crackdown on militants. Attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians have reached their highest level since the United Nations humanitarian office started collecting data in 2006. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has limited autonomy in parts of the territory, including Bethlehem. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to attend the midnight Mass on Wednesday night for the first time in two years, the mayor said. As poverty and unemployment have soared during the war, about 4,000 people have left Bethlehem in search of work, the mayor said. It’s part of a worrying trend for Christians, who are leaving the region in droves. Christians account for less than 2% of the West Bank’s roughly 3 million residents, a presence that has been shrinking. Across the Middle East, the Christian population has steadily declined as people have fled conflict and attacks. But on Wednesday, many were thrilled to once again mark Christmas in the birthplace of Christianity. The beginning of a return to normal life Fadi Zoughbi, who previously worked overseeing logistics for tour groups, said his children were ecstatic to see the more than two dozen scouts marching bands streaming through the streets of Bethlehem. They represent cities and towns across the West Bank, with Palestinian flags and tartan draped on their bagpipes, drummers spinning mallets adorned with pompoms. For the past two years, the scouts marched silently through the streets as a protest against the ongoing war. Irene Kirmiz, who grew up in Bethlehem and now lives in Ramallah, said the scout parade is among her favorite Christmas traditions. Her 15-year-old daughter plays the tenor drum with the Ramallah scouts, the same instrument she played as a teen scout. But her family in Ramallah had to wake up at 5 a.m. Wednesday to arrive in time for the parade and waited upwards of three hours at the Israeli checkpoints along the way. The drive previously took 40 minutes without the checkpoints that have increasingly made travel difficult for Palestinians, she said. “It's very emotional seeing people trying to bounce back, trying to celebrate peace and love,” Kirmiz said. “I remember the Bethlehem of my childhood, it really depends on tourism, and so many Christians have left, the streets are empty and families are suffering. But today we see a light of happiness, and we are hoping for a better peace for everyone."" The Israeli Ministry of Tourism estimates 130,000 tourists will visit Israel by the end of December, including 40,000 Christians. In 2019, a banner year for tourism before the pandemic, the tourism ministry said 150,000 Christian tourists visited during the week of Christmas alone. The war and lack of tourism has had far-reaching impacts in Bethlehem, exacerbated by Israel cancelling work permits for Palestinians from the West Bank during the war and thrusting the area deeper into poverty. During the previous two years, the heads of churches in Jerusalem urged congregations to forgo “any unnecessarily festive activities.” They encouraged priests and the faithful to focus on Christmas’ spiritual meaning and called for “fervent prayers for a just and lasting peace for our beloved Holy Land.” Bethlehem’s Manger Square did not erect the towering Christmas tree and instead featured a nativity scene of baby Jesus surrounded by rubble and barbed wire in homage to the situation in Gaza.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our is slowing plans to mass-produce and sell more advanced regulators have approved only two of nine proposals submitted by manufacturers seeking self-driving vehicles, according to reports, suggesting the country is easing off its push to commercialise higher levels of vehicle automation. Analysts are drawing a link between the tougher stance from the regulatory authority and a horror crash in March involving Xiaomi’s SU7 electric car that killed three university students. The car was travelling at around 72 miles per hour with its assisted-driving system engaged when it detected a lane closure due to roadworks. It issued an audible warning, after which the driver took control, but the vehicle struck a concrete barrier roughly one second later. Last week, the ministry of industry and IT granted approvals to two companies to operate so-called Level 3 self-driving vehicles. Level 3 systems can handle driving tasks under certain conditions without the driver’s hands on the wheel, but still require a human to be ready to take control. They are already operational in certain US states, albeit under strict limitations. But the approvals handed to Beijing Automotive Group and Changan Automobile are very limited. The companies will only be allowed to operate robotaxis on three designated stretches of highway each in Beijing and Chongqing, the cities where the companies are based, according to Chinese media Even then, the permission is limited to further testing rather than full commercial deployment. Under the rules, the vehicles are not allowed to change lanes while under computer control, and a human driver must take over once the car leaves the approved highway sections. Outside those limited zones, the systems cannot operate autonomously. The narrow scope of the approvals mark a setback for Chinese carmakers, which had expected regulators to green-light the sale of Level 3 systems by the end of this year. China currently only has Level 2 systems in operation, which can assist with steering and speed but require the driver to remain fully engaged at all times. Level 5 represents fully autonomous driving with no human intervention – no Level 5 vehicles are currently approved for public use anywhere in the world. , several Chinese automakers had already begun mass-producing vehicles equipped with the cameras, sensors and computing hardware needed for Level 3 systems, anticipating regulatory approval. Those vehicles are now expected to be sold with downgraded Level 2 software instead. In the aftermath of the crash in March, Chinese authorities banned carmakers from using marketing terms such as “smart driving” or “autonomous driving” for vehicles equipped only with assisted-driving systems, amid concerns that consumers could be misled about the technology’s capabilities. Public concern has also grown following reports in Chinese state media suggesting that some domestic assisted-driving systems lag behind competitors in safety performance. In one set of tests involving 36 vehicles equipped with Level 2 systems, fewer than half were able to successfully avoid a collision when approaching trucks at construction sites at night, the reports said. In contrast, the two Tesla vehicles included in the same tests were reported to have performed well across a range of scenarios. China has been seen as one of the most ambitious markets for autonomous driving technology, with strong government backing for electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. The country’s passenger‑vehicle autonomous‑driving market is projected to grow from about $9.85bn in 2024 to $15.3bn by 2030.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our During the COVID-19 pandemic, disinfectants became our shield. Hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes and antimicrobial sprays became part of daily life. They made us feel safe. Today, they are still everywhere: in homes, hospitals and public spaces. But there’s a hidden cost. The chemicals we trust to protect us may also Among the most common active ingredients in disinfectants are quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). They are found not only in the wipes, sprays and liquids we use to clean surfaces at home and in hospitals, but also in everyday products like fabric softeners and personal care products. Roughly half of the products on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) List N of disinfectants effective against SARS-CoV-2 and List Q for emerging viral pathogens contain QACs. Due to their widespread use, QACs enter wastewater treatment plants in substantial amounts, with effluents and sewage sludge being the main pathways through which QACs are released into the environment. Within wastewater treatment plants, more than 90 per cent of QACs are typically removed, but small amounts remain in the effluents and reach rivers and lakes, where they accumulate. Once QACs enter the environment, they meet microbial communities, networks of bacteria, archaea and fungi that recycle nutrients, purify water and support food webs. Given that QACs are designed to kill microbes, it is no surprise that they can affect environmental ones. Yet microbial communities are remarkably adaptable; some die, but others survive and evolve resistance. Unlike antibiotics, which target specific cellular processes, QACs attack microbes and viruses in many ways, damaging cell walls, proteins and lipids. This broad attack makes QACs powerful disinfectants. However, microbes are resourceful. Faced with these chemicals, some strengthen their cell membranes, pump toxins out or form protective biofilms. These adaptations don’t just help them survive QACs, but increasing evidence shows they can also boost antibiotic resistance. At the genetic level, QAC resistance genes are often carried on mobile DNA, segments of genetic material that can move between different bacteria. When these elements carry both QAC and antibiotic resistance genes, the resistances travel together and can spread across bacterial communities, a phenomenon called co-resistance. In other cases, a single defence mechanism protects against both QACs and antibiotics, a process known as cross-resistance. The widespread and increasing use of QACs amplifies these mechanisms, creating more opportunities for resistance to spread. This, in turn, establishes pathways through which can reach human pathogens, contributing to the global rise of antibiotic-resistant infections. Milena Esser is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Biology at McMaster University. According to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report, antimicrobial resistance is “critically high and rising” globally: In 2023, one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections responsible for common illnesses worldwide were resistant to antibiotic treatment. Between 2018 and 2023, resistance increased in more than 40 per cent of the pathogen-antibiotic combinations that are monitored, with an average annual rise of five to 15 per cent. The WHO estimates that in 2019, bacterial antimicrobial resistance directly caused 1.27 million deaths and contributed to nearly five million more worldwide. What begins as a household cleaning choice can ripple outward, connecting our everyday habits to one of the most pressing public health challenges of our time. Antimicrobial resistance is often seen as a clinical problem caused by antibiotic misuse, but it begins much earlier, in households, wastewater, rivers, lakes and soils. These are battlegrounds where microbes share resistance traits and adapt to human-made chemical pressures. Once resistance arises, it can make its way back to us. At its core, the disinfectant dilemma is a feedback loop: we disinfect to prevent disease, but the chemicals we rely on may quietly make microbes harder to control. This doesn’t mean we should stop disinfecting. Disinfectants play an essential role in infection control, especially in hospitals and high-risk settings where their benefits far outweigh their risks. The issue lies in their overuse in everyday life, where “clean” is often equated with “microbe-free”, regardless of necessity or consequence. What we rarely consider is that cleaning doesn’t end when the surface looks hygienic. Some disinfectants remain active long after use, continuing to shape microbial communities well beyond their intended moment of control. QACs are a clear example: they persist in the environment, exposing microbes to low, chronic selective pressures that can favour the development of resistance. Other disinfectants, such as alcohol and bleach, may carry different, but still meaningful environmental risks, underscoring the need for risk assessments that more explicitly integrate long-term ecological consequences. Ultimately, the disinfectant dilemma reminds us that managing microbes is as much about ecology as it is about chemistry. To clean responsibly, we need to think beyond what kills microbes today and consider how our choices shape the microbial world we will face tomorrow.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our is just around the corner, and you might be wondering how to spend those long, lazy afternoons. If you’re tired of the same old for three to four players fighting to be the dominant force on Catan island. Settlers of Catan fundamentally changed the board game industry since its launch in 1995. It has sold more than 40 million copies and led to dozens of spinoffs. Catan offers the strategic thrill of Monopoly, without the endless arguments or (occasional) tears. Instead of bankrupting your family, you could be building roads, trading resources and collecting victory points. It’s also an effective tool for developing strategic capabilities. These are skills that can be used to solve complex problems and plan for future success. Strategic thinking is essential today as we navigate social challenges, job insecurity and rapid technological change. While businesses spend heavily on consultants and training programs, you could build these skills at home. Game-based learning is a fun way to learn key business principles. Catan Island forms an artificial environment that mimics our social and business world. Players manage and trade resources to expand their territory by building houses, roads and cities to gain victory points. The first to reach 10 points wins. Catan presents a safe, enjoyable and challenging environment to facilitate strategic thinking in the classroom, improve communication and risk-taking, develop self-expression and prepare students to deal with uncertainty in the real world, while promoting decision-making and resilience. As the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said in an interview: “People say, ‘Where do I get my business strategy?’ It’s from game playing […] How much do you build for yourself, how much do you position against other people? [Catan is] the game that is closest of all the board games to entrepreneurship.” I’m a lecturer in strategic management and a keen Settlers of Catan player. In my class, we explore how strategic theories map onto gameplay. We look at how players practise strategic thinking to not only win the board game, but to apply these lessons to personal and business strategy. Catan is easy to learn, but it is never the same twice, and this mirrors the real, messy social and business world. Nelly Liyanagamage is a Lecturer at the University of Wollongong. In Catan, strategy is more important than luck. You will need to tap into your unique strategic capabilities. Everyone has different skills and capabilities, such as the ability to innovate, analyse, communicate, plan, manage or perhaps even empathise. Identifying and tapping into what makes you unique could give you a competitive advantage over rivals. To win Catan, or to reach your personal, professional or business goals, you must first analyse the environment. This step is critical, whether you’re deciding where to place your settlements, start a business or plan for your career. Start by considering your skills and resources: what are your strengths and weaknesses? Then analyse the environment for opportunities and threats. This could help you examine market conditions and future trends to better inform your plans and play to your strengths. Many players compete to build houses, cities and connecting roads. But strategists would attempt alternative pathways. Don’t get stuck with the status quo. Let the other players fight over the same resources, while you quietly leverage a differentiation strategy. In business, differentiation is when you offer something to customers your rivals don’t, cannot or never considered. Catan does not have infinite resources, and in every turn, you must decide how to use your resources. But every choice means giving up another possibility. Resource management is fundamental to business and personal budgeting. You or your organisation will not have unlimited resources, and you must be strategic in whether you . Reflect on every decision and don’t forget the bigger picture. You can’t win alone, and you shouldn’t have to. You will need to plan, adapt, and form alliances or break them. Just like game play, we must work with others in our personal life or businesses. Catan teaches us to do our research before trading. Understand the rules. Research the other party. Be clear about the exchange. Some players think two or three steps ahead when proposing a trade, maybe because they have access to unique resources. Ask yourself: did you analyse your competition? Are you exposing yourself to future threats? To be resilient is to have the capacity to rebound or bounce back from adversity. Catan is riddled with risks and uncertainty. Life and business is just as unpredictable, and we don’t always win, but we can capitalise on our personal, social or psychological resources to prepare for future wins. , the founder of the Dyson Vacuum, who spent 15 years perfecting his design without giving up: “It didn’t happen overnight, but after years of testing, tweaking, fist-banging, and after more than 5,000 prototypes, it was there.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our already looked tight for Jade Grant and her three children as she entered the year's final months. “Everyone’s birthday is back-to-back,” the 32-year-old certified nursing assistant said. “You have holidays coming up. You have Thanksgiving. Everything is right there. And then, boom. No (food) stamps.” Grant is among the nearly 42 million lower-income who get help buying groceries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. When the federal shutdown began in October, she wasn't worried about losing her benefits — she said she is used to government “foolishness.” But circumstances got dicey when the budget impasse entered its second month and President took the unprecedented step of freezing November SNAP payments. With one child who eats gluten free and another with many allergies, specialty items already drove up her grocery bill. Now Grant wondered how she'd put food on the table — especially with her youngest's 6th birthday approaching. Then Grant logged into Propel, an app used by 5 million people to manage their electronic benefits transfers, where she saw a pop-up banner inviting her to apply for a relief program. Within a minute she'd completed a survey and about two days later she got a virtual $50 gift card. The total didn't come close to her monthly SNAP allotment. But the Palm Bay, Florida, resident said it was enough to buy a customized “ Nearly a quarter of a million families got that same cash injection from the nonprofit GiveDirectly as they missed SNAP deposits many need to feed their households. The collaboration with Propel proved to be the largest disaster response in the international cash assistance group's history outside of COVID-19; non-pandemic records were set with the $12 million raised, more than 246,000 beneficiaries enrolled and 5,000 individual donors reached. Recipients are still recovering from the uncertainty of last month's SNAP delays. Company surveys suggest many are dealing with the long-term consequences of borrowing money in early November when their benefits didn’t arrive on time, according to Propel CEO Jimmy Chen. At a time when users felt the existing safety net had fallen through, they credit the rapid payments for buoying them — both financially and emotionally. “It’s not a lot. But at the same time, it is a lot,” Grant said. “Because $50 can do a lot when you don’t have anything.” A ‘man-made disaster’ forces partners to try something new It's not the first partnership for the antipoverty nonprofit and for-profit software company. They have previously combined GiveDirectly's fast cash model with Propel's verified user base to get money out to natural disaster survivors — including $1,000 last year to some households impacted by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. “This particular incident with the shutdown we saw as akin to a natural disaster,"" Chen said, “in the sense that it created a really sudden and really acute form of hardship for many Americans across the country.” The scope differed this time. The “man-made disaster,” as GiveDirectly U.S. Country Director Dustin Palmer put it, was not geographically isolated. The benefits freeze impacted more people than they usually serve. SNAP costs almost $10 billion a month, Palmer said, so they never expected to raise enough money to replace the delayed benefits altogether. But 5,000 individual donors — plus $1 million gifts from Propel and New York nonprofit Robin Hood, as well as other major foundations' support — provided a sizable pot. Palmer found that the issue resonated more than he expected. GiveDirectly reports that the median donation was $100. Palmer took that response as a sign the issue hit close for many Americans. “You and I know SNAP recipients. Maybe we’ve been SNAP recipients,"" Palmer said. ""So that was not a disaster in Central Texas where I’ve never been, but something in our communities.” The greatest question revolved around the total sum of each cash transfer. Should they reach more people with fewer dollars or vice versa? Los Angeles wildfire survivors, for example, got $3,500 each from a similar GiveDirectly campaign. But that's because they wanted to provide enough to cover a month's worth of lodging and transit to those who lost their houses. They settled on $50 because Palmer said they wanted a “stopgap” that represented “a meaningful trip to the grocery store."" To equitably focus their limited resources on the that would be missing the most support, Palmer said they targeted families with children that receive the maximum SNAP allotment. Propel's software allowed them to send money as soon as the app detected that a family's benefits hadn't arrived at the usual time of the month. Recipients decided whether their prepaid debit cards arrived physically, which might allow them to take cash out of an , or virtually, which could be used almost immediately. The split is usually pretty even, according to Palmer, but this time more than 90% of recipients went with the virtual option. “To me, that speaks to the speed and need for people,” Palmer said. “Just saying, ‘Oh yeah, I just need food today. I don’t want to wait to get it mailed.’” Recipients lost trust when closely watched benefits were disrupted Dianna Tompkins relies on her SNAP balance to feed her toddler and 8-year-old child. “I watch it like a hawk, honestly,” she said. But she said she entered “panic mode” when she missed what is usually a $976 deposit last month. She's a gig worker, completing DoorDash and Uber Eats orders when she finds the time. Her pantry is always stocked with non-perishables — canned goods, pastas, sauces — in case her unreliable van stops working and she can't get to the store. But she couldn't risk running out as uncertainty continued over the shutdown's length and future SNAP payments. GiveDirectly’s $50 bought her milk and bread — not much but a “big help,” she said. Her local food pantries in Demotte, Indiana, had proven inconsistent. One week they gave far more than expected, she said, but the following week they were “so overwhelmed” that it almost wasn't worth visiting. She said it's “scary” the government “can just decide to not feed so many people.” “At least I have my safety net but not everybody’s lucky,” she said. “I’ve never trusted the government and that’s just a new solid reason why I don’t trust them.” Chen, the Propel CEO, said his company's research suggests that November's freeze damaged many recipients' confidence in the government. Even with SNAP funded through the next fiscal year, Chen said, many respondents are concerned about another shutdown. “Now it’s introduced this seed of doubt for people that this really fundamental thing that they use to pay for food may not be there when they need it,” Chen said. The gap persists for many. Propel estimates that just over half of SNAP recipients got their benefits late last month. GiveDirectly launched an additional “mop-up” campaign to distribute cash retroactively for more than 8,000 people still reeling. The delay disrupted the financial balancing act that Grant had going. She put off payments for her electricity bill and car insurance. “Government shuts down and that just throws everything completely off,"" she said.

Read our While the pre-Christmas shopping frenzy peaks, 25 per cent of festive shoppers will delay buying some gifts until after Christmas Day, a survey has revealed. This trend is largely due to the cost of living crisis, with many seeking savings in post-Christmas sales. Two-fifths (41 per cent) of those surveyed for cashback website Rakuten see sales as a good way to economise. Additionally, a third (32 per cent) believe money saved by delaying purchases justifies changing the tradition of opening gifts on Christmas Day. Men, the research notes, are more likely than women to postpone gift buying until after the festive period. The survey indicated that shoppers expect to spend £163 on average in the Boxing Day sales. The research also found that, apart from the financial savings, there were other advantages to leaving some gift-buying until after Christmas Day. Some people hold off to avoid pre-Christmas stress and crowds, and some believe that buying gifts after Christmas Day helps to extend the festive atmosphere into the new year. The survey also indicated that many gift recipients will not mind waiting until after 25 December to find something under the Christmas tree with their name on it. For more than half (52 per cent) of those who celebrate Christmas, receiving a gift after Christmas Day is not a problem, according to the survey of 2,000 people across the UK carried out by OnePoll in October. Rakuten’s savings expert, Bola Sol, said: “With prices slashed and discounts galore, waiting a few extra days can mean big savings. It’s a great way to stretch the present budget, especially for those who aren’t too fussy about receiving or giving gifts on Christmas Day.” She suggested setting a Boxing Day sales budget, comparing prices, and combining gift budgets with friends and family members to give a more meaningful gift without overspending.",The Independent,The Independent

Her new CR-V has typical door handles rather than Tesla's touch-sensitive flush handles. Other Tesla owners are reportedly preparing themselves and their passengers to escape the vehicles if necessary. Some drivers have said they're buying glass breakers to smash through their windows if they're trapped in their electric cars. Rideshare drivers with Teslas have reportedly started showing their passengers how to access the cars' hidden manual door latches so they can escape an emergency. E-shop owners have capitalized on the issue, selling third-party accessories that help Tesla owners more easily access their manual latches. Content creators on YouTube and posters on Reddit have created guides for installing the mods. Since 2018, there have been more than 140 complaints to U.S. auto safety regulators reporting electric car doors — and not just from Tesla EVs — that were either . The report found that the doors that did malfunction often did so after crashes. Tesla's chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, said during a September appearance on Bloomberg's Hot Pursuit! podcast that the company is redesigning the doors to make escaping the car easier and quicker in a “panic situation.” “The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” he said. “That’s something that we’re working on.” It's likely a bitter pill for the company to swallow, as it introduced and popularized flush handles. Fans of the design note the sleek look it gives the vehicles, but the lack of an easily-accessible manual latch means that when the car loses power, the doors do not function. Chad Lincoln, an Uber driver in Tennessee, said he had rented a 2022 Tesla Model 3 to use for work after his usual work vehicle was damaged in an accident. He said he realized he needed to give his customers a safety orientation to make sure they could escape the vehicle in an emergency. “We went over my flight attendant’s pitch on how to get out, and the strap to pull,” he told Bloomberg. Lincoln said the ""safety concerns around the manual release is really big for me."" “I really take the responsibility of my passengers’ safety seriously,” he added.

Read our Vegan beauty is arguably in its prime, having evolved from products with bland packaging and inconsistent formulas to now frequently outperforming their traditional counterparts. Karen Spinner, head of sales and marketing at the Vegan Trademark, clarifies the definition: ""a product has no animal ingredients and no animal-derived products, [which is] also cruelty free – so no animal testing."" However, Spinner notes that a cruelty-free label does not automatically signify a vegan product. The beauty industry frequently incorporates animal derivatives, with common ingredients that can mislead consumers including ""squalene, that’s an extract of shark’s liver, you’ll often find in deodorants, lip balms and moisturisers."" “Ambergris, which comes from fat of the intestine of the sperm whale – that’s used in the perfume industry,” Spinner explains.

It’s very trendy at the moment, and lots of vanilla perfumes have a have an animal by product called castoreum, which is secreted from the castor sacs of beavers. “Then obviously you’ve got cochineal, which is for pigment, created by crushing insects – you find that in lots of lipsticks, blushes and nail polishes.” If you’re planning on dipping your toe into veganism this , the best vegan products are those you wouldn’t even realise are fully plant-based and cruelty-free. So, here are the vegan beauty staples worth making room for in 2026. Good skin underpins beauty today, with some of the biggest trends like ‘glass skin’ and ‘hazy cheeks’ relying on the health and vibrance of bare skin. And luckily, some of the most effective formulas on the market are entirely vegan. Aesop is often associated with luxurious self-care, but many consumers don’t realise that its also vegan, Leaping Bunny-approved and certified B Corp. The Parsley Seed Facial Cleanser is one of the brand’s most enduring formulas, designed with urban living in mind. and daily pollution without stripping the skin barrier – something that’s particularly important for combination or city-stressed complexions. Rich in antioxidant botanicals, it leaves skin feeling balanced – not tight – making it a reliable everyday option for those who want effective plant-based cleansing without overcomplicating their routine. Medik8 is a science-led skincare brand trusted by beauty lovers and dermatologists alike – and many users may not even realise its formulas are vegan. Certified vegan by the Vegan Society, Medik8 is a science-based skincare brand, and one of its bestsellers is the daily moisturiser. It’s non-comedogenic, meaning it doesn’t clog pores, and is suitable for both dry and oily skin types thanks to its perfected combination of prebiotic peptides, ceramides and lipids for ultimate hydration without excess grease. Base make-up has historically been the hardest category for vegan beauty to get right. But more recently, vegan formulas are being perfected due to consumer demand. “The vegan society’s own research carried out in 2021 found that 40% of the women in the UK who always buy vegan beauty aren’t actually vegan,” Spinner says, showing the growth in conscious consumerism. Not all Ultrasun products are vegan, as many of their lip products contain beeswax, however this tinted fluid is vegan and the perfect base all year round. A rare hybrid that delivers broad-spectrum sun protection alongside sheer, skin-evening coverage. Lightweight and non-greasy, it works well for everyday wear and is especially useful if you prefer minimal makeup with maximum protection. Merit has built its reputation around pared-back, skin-first make-up that prioritises ease and wearability. The Minimalist Complexion Stick reflects that ethos perfectly, sitting somewhere between a concealer and a foundation. The creamy vegan formula blends effortlessly with fingers or a brush, offering buildable coverage that still looks like skin. Ideal for evening out redness, dark circles or blemishes, it still has a natural pay-off looking light and unfussy. Vegan formulas no longer compromise on pigment or longevity, and some of 2025’s best eye products were in fact vegan. , the influencer-slash-YouTuber founded beauty brand, Vieve has made waves this year. Launched in 2020 by Jamie Genevieve, Vieve has created viral products including its balmy foundation hybrid and its eye products. The Vieve mascara is a standout, it delivers volume and definition without flaking or stiffness. The formula builds well, making it suitable for both natural daytime looks and fuller evening lashes, without drying out over time. E.l.f Cosmetics is an old-school vegan brand, which is double-certified cruelty free by both PETA and Leaping Bunny. It’s cream eyeshadow is a practical, long-wearing shadow that delivers colour in one swipe. It sets quickly without creasing, making it reliable for fast routines or long days when you don’t want to think about touch-ups. Made and manufactured in the south of England, Grove England is a hidden gem for luxury vegan body care. However, it’s important to note that while they claim vegan status, they don’t prominently display a third-party certification logo (like Vegan Society or Leaping Bunny), so it is still important to check the ingredients list and manufacturing information of their products. This neroli and cedarwood scented body wash however is vegan according to its ingredients, and contains antioxidants, vitamin B5 and amino acids which leaves skin nourished and radiant. Aromatica is a K-beauty brand that has boomed in popularity this year. All their ingredients are all ECOCERT certified, vegan-friendly and are not tested on animals. This body lotion is one of their hero products, it leaves the body hydrated thanks to its pure shea butter, while the vegan formula means it absorbs well – even on damp skin – without leaving a sticky or greasy residue. Recent years has seen a rise in demand for vegan beauty products, mainly due to rising ethical concerns, health consciousness (as people are becoming more aware of how processed animal products react with the skin) and environmental awareness. “Over 52% of [the Vegan Society’s] market is cosmetics and beauty,” says Spinner, “people always think food when they think vegan, but actually cosmetics, beauty and personal care is the biggest market for us.” It seems that now is as better time than any to test out some vegan beauty products, starting with easy swaps such as a beeswax lip balm with a candelilla wax balm.

Read our Suze Lopez holds her baby boy on her lap and marvels at the remarkable way he came into the world. Before little Ryu was born, he developed outside his mom’s womb, hidden by a basketball-sized ovarian cyst — a dangerous situation so rare that his doctors plan to write about the case for a medical journal. Just 1 in 30,000 pregnancies occur in the abdomen instead of the uterus, and those that make it to full term “are essentially unheard of – far, far less than 1 in a million,” said Dr. John Ozimek, medical director of labor and delivery at Cedars-Sinai in where Ryu was born. “I mean, this is really insane.” , didn’t know she was pregnant with her second child until days before giving birth. When her belly began to grow earlier this year, she thought it was her ovarian cyst getting bigger. Doctors had been monitoring the mass since her 20s, leaving it in place after removing her right ovary and another cyst. Lopez experienced none of the usual pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness, and never felt kicks. Though she didn’t have a period, her cycle is irregular and she sometimes goes years without one. For months, she and her husband Andrew Lopez went about their lives and traveled abroad. But gradually, the pain and pressure in her abdomen got worse, and Lopez figured it was finally time to get the 22-pound cyst removed. She needed a , which required a pregnancy test first because of the radiation exposure. To her great surprise, the test came back positive. Lopez shared the news with her husband at a Dodgers baseball game in August, handing him a package with a note and a onesie. “I just saw her face,” he recalled, “and she just looked like she wanted to weep and smile and cry at the same time.” Shortly after the game, Lopez began feeling unwell and sought help at Cedars-Sinai. It turned out she had dangerously high blood pressure, which the medical team stabilized. They also did blood work and gave her an ultrasound and an . The scans found that her uterus was empty, but a nearly full-term fetus in an amniotic sac was hiding in a small space in her abdomen, near her liver. “It did not look like it was directly invading any organs,” Ozimek said. “It looked like it was mostly implanted on the sidewall of the pelvis, which is also very dangerous but more manageable than being implanted in the liver.” Dr. Cara Heuser, a maternal-fetal specialist in Utah not involved with the case, said almost all pregnancies that implant outside the uterus — called ectopic pregnancies — go on to rupture and hemorrhage if not removed. Most commonly, they occur in the fallopian tubes. A 2023 medical journal article by doctors in Ethiopia described another abdominal pregnancy in which mother and baby survived, pointing out that fetal mortality can be as high as 90% in such cases and birth defects are seen in about 1 in 5 surviving babies. But Lopez and her son beat all the odds. On August 18, a medical team delivered the 8-pound (3.6-kilogram) baby while she was under full anesthesia, removing the cyst during the same surgery. She lost nearly all of her blood, Ozimek said, but the team got the bleeding under control and gave her transfusions. Doctors continually updated her husband about what was happening. “The whole time, I might have seemed calm on the outside, but I was doing nothing but praying on the inside,” Andrew Lopez said. “It was just something that scared me half to death, knowing that at any point I could lose my wife or my child.” Since then, Ryu — named after a baseball player and a character in the Street Fighter video game series — has been healthy and thriving. His parents love watching him interact with his 18-year-old sister, Kaila, and say he completes their family. With Ryu’s first Christmas approaching, Lopez describes feeling blessed beyond measure. “I do believe in miracles,” she said, looking down at her baby. “God gave us this gift — the best gift ever.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Both are charged in connection with the alleged break-in at Brize Norton. They will next appear in court for a preliminary hearing on 16 January, having appeared at the Old Bailey via video link on 12 December. Lord Timpson, prisons minister, said: “We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes. Unfortunately, over the last five years we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year and the processes that we have are well-established and they work very well – with prisons working alongside our NHS partners every day, making sure our systems are robust and working – and they are. “I am very clear. I don’t treat any prisoners differently to others. That is why we will not be meeting any prisoners or their representatives. We have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our of violating the U.S.-backed ceasefire. It was the latest incident to threaten the tenuous truce that has held since Oct. 10 as each side accuses the other of violations. The blast came as Hamas met with Turkish officials in Ankara to discuss the second stage of the ceasefire. Though the agreement has mostly held, its progress has slowed. All but one of the 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war have been released, alive or dead, in exchange for prisoners and detainees. The ceasefire's second phase has even bigger challenges: the deployment of an international stabilization force, a technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory. Israel's military said the explosive detonated beneath a military vehicle as soldiers were “dismantling” militant infrastructure in the southern city of Rafah. The lightly injured soldier was taken to a hospital, the military said. in a statement called the incident a violation of the ceasefire and said Israel would ""respond accordingly.” Israel previously launched strikes in Gaza in response to alleged ceasefire violations. On Oct. 19, Israel said two soldiers were killed by Hamas fire and it responded with a series of strikes that killed over 40 Palestinians, according to local health officials. Hamas accuses Israel of violating the ceasefire by not allowing enough aid into the territory and continuing to strike civilians. Palestinian health officials say over 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the truce. On Friday, Israeli troops fired over the ceasefire line in northern Gaza, killing at least five Palestinians, including a baby, according to a local hospital that received the casualties. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with a Hamas delegation led by Khalil al-Haya to discuss the ceasefire's second phase, according to ministry officials. Fidan reaffirmed Turkey’s efforts to defend the rights of Palestinians and outlined ongoing efforts to address shelter and other humanitarian needs in Gaza, the officials said. The Hamas delegation said they had fulfilled the ceasefire’s conditions but that Israel’s continued attacks were blocking progress toward the next stage. They also asserted that 60% of the trucks allowed into Gaza were carrying commercial goods rather than aid. According to the officials, the meeting also discussed reconciliation efforts between the Palestinian factions and the situation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, stressing that Israel’s actions there were “unacceptable.” Find more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our The personal cost that farming families have endured will not be forgotten, the Conservatives said, following the Government’s climbdown over inheritance tax. Labour’s watered-down plans will see the relief threshold for farmers raised from £1 million to £2.5 million. This comes after months of protests and warnings over farmers contemplating suicide to avoid the taxes as they pass their businesses from generation to generation. A farmer whose father killed himself the day before last October’s budget amid worries over the inheritance tax changes said he hoped the change will “prevent a flood of suicides running up to the commencement in April”. Jonathan Charlesworth welcomed the U-turn, but accused ministers of “a complete lack of understanding and compassion” towards rural communities. for making the announcement so close to Christmas, with Parliament in recess and currently unable to scrutinise it “properly”. The higher threshold, which will take effect in April, will allow spouses or civil partners to pass on up to £5 million in qualifying agricultural or business assets between them before paying inheritance tax – on top of existing allowances, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said on Tuesday. Above that allowance, farmers will get 50% relief on qualifying assets and will pay a reduced effective rate of up to 20%, rather than the standard 40%. The number of estates facing higher inheritance tax will be reduced from around 2,000 under the original plans to up to 1,100, hitting only the largest farms, according to the Government. Farmers currently do not pay inheritance tax on agricultural and business assets which they pass on. Under Labour’s initial proposal, the full 100% relief was to be restricted to the first £1 million of property. Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, Ms Atkins said: “Whilst this is a welcome U-turn, nonetheless, it has come at a very, very high economic cost, because we know that business investment and business confidence has plummeted. “This Government is overseeing record farm closures, but it’s also come at a huge personal cost as well, for many families, and that will not be forgotten, I suspect, by them.” She added: “This being snuck out the day before Christmas Eve means that, of course, we haven’t had chance to scrutinise this properly in Parliament.” Baroness Minette Batters, the former head of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), had raised concerns about farmers contemplating suicide to avoid the tax changes. Mr Charlesworth, who found his father John Philip Charlesworth dead in a barn on their farm in Silkstone, Barnsley, told the Press Association: “It’s a welcome U-turn that won’t bring back the lives lost over the last year or so due to the anxiety caused, but will hopefully prevent a flood of suicides running up to the commencement in April.” He also said: “The flip side is, it should have been researched and put out to review before any announcement was made.” backbenchers, with Penrith and Solway MP Markus Campbell-Savours losing the party whip earlier this month for voting against them. He remains expelled, with Labour saying it will review his suspension in due course. Sir Keir Starmer had defended what he described as a “sensible reform” last week, telling the Liaison Committee he understands farmers’ concerns. The Prime Minister has changed course on a number of policies this year, with a U-turn on plans to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners and scaling back reforms to curb the soaring welfare bill to avert a backbench rebellion in the summer. Announcing the tax relief threshold hike, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said the Government had “listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms”. “It’s only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain’s rural communities,” she added. president Tom Bradshaw said the announcement would be a “huge relief to many” and would “greatly” reduce the tax burden for many family farms. “Other family businesses are still affected by Labour’s tax raid, and we will keep pushing until the tax is lifted from them too,” she added. The Liberal Democrats’ environment, food and rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron called for the Government to scrap the “unfair tax in full” as “many family farms will still find themselves financially crippled and barely making the minimum wage”.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our A newly married young mother, Susan Cole was stunned when she was diagnosed with Aged 30, Ms Cole had been tested for the virus in 1999 following a routine immigration test in the US, but Still reeling from the diagnosis, her doctor went on to deliver Ms Cole another round of devastating news – that she only had seven years left to live. and said ‘the good news is you don't have syphilis’, and then ‘the bad news is you're HIV positive’.” Now, more than 25 years on, Ms Cole has defied the doctor’s prediction. She has spent the last two decades campaigning for people with HIV and has also set up a not-for-profit organisation that addresses health inequalities affecting Black women. Isolated from her family in the UK, Ms Cole was careful about who she told and only went to her closest friends and family for support. But the one thing that helped her process her HIV diagnosis was research. “My way of coping with my diagnosis was to find out everything I could about HIV, and I soon realised the doctor was wrong and that I could live as long as anyone else,” she said. “I think knowledge has been the most empowering thing for me.” , HIV is spread through infected bodily fluids entering someone’s bloodstream, such as through birth, sex or sharing needles. Soon after infection, there may be no symptoms, but if left untreated, it damages the immune system and may eventually cause more serious illnesses, such as tuberculosis, pneumonia or cancer. This is known as Aids. There is currently no cure for HIV, but there are antiretroviral treatments in the form of tablets taken every day, which can bring the virus down to an undetectable level in the blood. This means the infection can no longer be passed on and the person can live a long and healthy life. Ms Cole, who runs the Phoenix Health Movement, asked her GP for an HIV test before she moved to the US. “Not that I felt I was at any particular risk, but I heard there were tests. But the doctor said, ‘Oh no dear, HIV doesn’t affect ladies like you.’ I think often people, including healthcare professionals, have an idea that HIV isn’t something that affects them,” she said. The government aims to end HIV transmissions by 2030 through increased testing, improving awareness of prevention and addressing the stigma that many people living with the virus continue to face. The latest HIV surveillance data for 2024 shows new diagnoses are falling by 4 per cent across the UK, from 3,169 in 2023 to 3,043 in 2024. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily antiretroviral medicine taken by HIV-negative people which stops its transmission during unprotected sex, became routinely available on the NHS in England in 2020. But around 24 per cent of people who are more likely to acquire HIV need better access to PrEP. This includes heterosexual women, who are less likely to be recognised as people who require HIV prevention compared with gay and bisexual men. , is also set to be made available on the NHS in England and Wales – offering an alternative to daily pills. “There is so much stigma around HIV and people don’t want to be seen taking tablets. So having an injection might be expensive, but ultimately it’s saving the NHS money because fewer people are getting HIV,” said Ms Cole, who now lives in London. “Very often lots of women don’t feel comfortable going into sexual health clinics, for instance, but if we had this widely available from pharmacists and the GPs, that would just make it so much better.” ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company, warned that the government’s target to eliminate new HIV transmissions by 2030 will not be met without tailored interventions that reach women and other underserved groups. The company launched its “Risk to Reasons” initiative to empower both women and healthcare professionals to have open and honest conversations about HIV prevention options without fear. “It’s systemic racism in healthcare settings. Black women are more likely , and often when we go to the doctors, we’re not believed about our pain. We need to tackle these issues because if women don’t feel that they’re being listened to, they’re not going to feel comfortable about having conversations about HIV,” Ms Cole said. There are many stereotypes and myths surrounding women and HIV, Ms Cole warned. One myth is that women with HIV will pass HIV on to their children, but Ms Cole explains this is not true, and she has four children – two before her diagnosis and two after – who were born free of HIV. Those on treatment with an undetectable load have a 0.1 per cent chance of passing on the virus. She added that people on effective treatment can’t pass HIV on to sexual partners and can live as long as anyone else. Some 25 years later, Ms Cole is thriving. “I think we need to look at the language around HIV because there can be a focus on talking about risks, which can increase the stigma. We need to shift the language to have a much more empowering sex positive conversation,” she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: HIV treatment has been transformed. Today, people living with HIV can enjoy full, healthy lives – and can’t pass the virus on to others, which is remarkable progress. “Ending new HIV transmissions by 2030 is ambitious – but this government is determined to make it happen through our new HIV Action Plan. “The plan is backed by £170m and sets out how we will address stigma, improve access to testing and prevention, and ensure services reach all communities who need them. It will also fund formula milk and sterilising equipment to reduce mother-to-baby transmission.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our drifted towards me the moment I stepped out of Takadanobaba station in ’s Shinjuku district. It felt worlds away from central Shinjuku’s neon glare – with its stampede-level crowds and a giant 3D cat that springs out of a billboard every 15 minutes, meowing. Takadanobaba is comparatively calm, its corners guarded by gently humming vending machines that dispense everything from matcha lattes to jiggly cheesecake. The only real overlap between the two areas is the queues that spill out of their branches of Day – my first in a country that didn’t really observe either the religious side of the holiday or adhere to the usual festive fuss. It was simply another working day in Tokyo: people in business attire hurried home, trains were packed with weary commuters, and not a single mulled wine stall was in sight. Yurakucho – just by the Imperial Palace – had attempted a “European ”, though what stocked its stalls was far from traditional fare, leaning more towards towering plates of okonomiyaki and steaming soba than hot chocolate and overpriced baubles. doesn’t do “traditional” Christmas, there is one foodstuff it wholeheartedly adopts at this time of year – and as you’d expect, it isn’t European in the slightest. Instead of turkey, families queue for buckets of from KFC, a ritual so entrenched that securing a Christmas meal often requires booking weeks in advance. The story goes that Takeshi Okawara, who managed Japan’s first KFC, came up with the “Kentucky for Christmas” campaign in the early 1970s after overhearing an expat remark on the absence of turkey in the country and suggesting that fried chicken was the next best festive option. The idea resonated immediately, and gradually it snowballed into a nationwide ritual that continues to shape Japan’s December after five decades. Perhaps Colonel Sanders bearing more than a passing resemblance to Father Christmas – especially once dressed in red – helped the custom take hold of the concept. And after years of hearing Japanese friends rave about the country’s devotion to Christmas fried chicken during my university days, a far-flung winter break finally gave me the chance to see the tradition in action. Though one requirement threw a spanner in the works: halal chicken – something KFC Japan doesn’t offer. And even if it had done, I was far too late to place an order. Luckily for me, Takadanobaba has a sizeable and visible Muslim community, shaped largely by its international student population from Waseda University and the many nearby language schools that draw residents from around the world – which meant there were plenty of halal spots happily joining in the fried chicken frenzy. I made my way through Takadanobaba’s back alleys to Halal Master Chicken, a fried-chicken restaurant with solid Google reviews. Taking the road less familiar, I passed houses strung with fairy lights, lone Christmas trees perched outside tiny homes and, inevitably, more vending machines. It’s remarkable that, despite Japan’s endless supply of treat-dispensing technology, litter is surprisingly rare – a stark contrast to the average street in London. In fact, there are almost no bins on Japanese roadsides at all, as it’s deeply ingrained in the culture to carry waste home rather than discard it while out and about. As I arrived at Halal Master Chicken, a queue was curling out of the restaurant, running neatly between a 7-Eleven on one side of the road and a FamilyMart on the other. A paper sign reading “Christmas fried chicken available here!” hung from the main door, held up by a tired strip of tape. Inside, every orange chair and table was occupied. Families and friends crowded around their plates, clutching Christmas-themed paper cups and buckets of fried chicken, while a lady in the open-kitchen worked briskly – frying a whole bird in one pan and roasting another on the grill beside her. The smell wafting outside was intoxicating, and my stomach growled in agreement. The ramen I’d eaten earlier felt like a distant memory. The queue wasn’t made up solely of Muslims waiting for a halal take on Japan’s beloved tradition – plenty of other locals were in line too, some put off by the lack of space in their nearest KFC and others by the cost. A standard Christmas party box (or party barrel as nicknamed by Okawara) at KFC – eight small pieces of chicken, a shrimp gratin and a chocolate cake – comes in at ¥4,580 (£23) when booked in advance. The queue moved slowly but steadily and, once inside, I flicked through the extensive menu promising chicken in every imaginable form. I settled on two fried pieces, some chips and a drink, but after glancing at the enormous burger on the table nearby, I couldn’t resist adding that to my order as well. The lady beside me caught my glance lingering on her food and offered a polite smile. I grinned back in sheepish embarrassment, but also took it as a cue to ask a few questions about the ritual and what it signified. Between mouthfuls, she tells me of the tradition: “We grew up seeing American pop culture celebrate Christmas, and because Japan didn’t historically have its own Christmas traditions, KFC stepped in and set the template for how the holiday could be celebrated here. Maybe it filled a void?” As well as KFC, she says that local restaurants and grab-and-go meals from 7-Elevens are a popular choice – though those also sell out very quickly in the lead-up to Christmas. My food arrived in clouds of steam – a huge tray bearing my stacked fried chicken burger topped with a sesame-seed bun, drizzled in honey mustard and tomato sauce, standard thin chips and two beautifully crisp pieces of chicken. I’d paired it with an iced melon tea, which had quickly become my favourite drink in Japan. The serving was so enormous it was almost impossible to get a proper bite in, but once I managed it, the sense of internal satisfaction was unmatched. If I hadn’t known better, I could easily have mistaken it for KFC. The lone lady managing both the kitchen and the crowds hurried over with a stack of tissues after noticing the sauces escaping from the corners of my mouth. I asked whether Christmas was always this busy for her. “It certainly is our busiest time,” she said, switching between English and animated hand gestures. “We get so many families and groups – everyone’s in a good mood, and they all want their Christmas chicken, so it’s a fun day for us.” I nodded. The place was heaving – every table filled with people happily working through their own version of Christmas chicken. Across the road, another fried chicken shop had a small crowd forming outside. It couldn’t have been further from a British Christmas – no turkey, no Brussels sprouts (a blessing, frankly) – yet people from across Tokyo, from different cultures, backgrounds and religions, had gathered to celebrate in their own way, much as we do back home. And in a country that doesn’t officially observe Christmas as a religious or cultural holiday, Japan still manages to make it feel magical, with fried chicken somehow at the centre of it all.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our as part of an investigation into a second wealthy sex offender, the for sexually assaulting four women between the late 1980s and 2005, and has also been accused of raping girls as young as 14. A letter written to the UK authorities in April 2020 requests that Andrew attend a voluntary interview on both the and the Nygard investigations, both of which involved the sex trafficking of minors. The FBI refers to a visit made by Andrew and his family to Nygard’s luxury Caribbean resort, which he renamed Nygard Cay, in 2000. “The investigation has revealed that, on at least one occasion, Prince Andrew travelled to Nygard Cay in the Bahamas, a location where Nygard is believed to have trafficked minor and adult female victims,” the document reads. The authorities requested that he share any information he had gathered on Nygard and other related individuals, but stressed that Andrew was not the target of the investigation, and there was no evidence he had committed any crime under US law. Nygard, who once led a women’s fashion empire, was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault in November 2024 but acquitted of a fifth count as well as one count of forcible confinement. The 84-year-old faces separate sexual assault and sex trafficking charges in During his trial, five women testified they had met Nygard at a nightclub or on a plane and were then invited to his headquarters under pretexts ranging from tours to job interviews. All five women said their meetings or interactions with Nygard ended with sexual activity that they did not consent to. The FBI letter reads: “With regard to the interview, US authorities request to conduct a voluntary interview of Prince Andrew and request the assistance of UK authorities in arranging for such an interview. In the event that the witness declines to participate in a voluntary interview, US authorities request that UK authorities conduct a compelled interview of the witness under oath.” The FBI also sought information on Andrew’s relationship with paedophile financier Epstein and his associate , who was jailed for 20 years for her role in procuring young girls to be abused by the billionaire. Following his arrest, Epstein died in his prison cell in July 2019, with US authorities citing his cause of death as suicide. In requesting an interview, the document notes: “Additionally, documentary evidence uncovered during the course of this investigation has revealed information suggesting that Prince Andrew had knowledge that Maxwell recruited females to engage in sex acts with Epstein and other men.” Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing or having any knowledge of Epstein’s sex crimes. on Tuesday, sent by someone titled “The Invisible Man” to Maxwell in August 2001, the sender told the now convicted sex trafficker their “valet” had recently died and that they had “left the RN”. Andrew left the Royal Navy the month before the email was sent. Another email from the same individual, dated August 16 2001, said they were at “Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family” before asking Maxwell: “Have you found me some inappropriate friends?” In March 2002, an email from Maxwell to “The Invisible Man” said they had passed on a message to an unnamed individual, with that message beginning with: “I just gave Andrew your telephone no.” The message from Maxwell to the unidentified person also said that “Andrew” would be “very happy” if he did some “two legged sight seeing”. Maxwell’s message read: “He can ride but it is not his favorite sport ie pass on the horses. “Some sight seeing some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy. “I know I can rely on you to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun. “He does not want to read about any trip in the papers whom or what he saw.” Photographs previously released by the Department of Justice appeared to show Andrew introducing Epstein to British high society – including a shooting trip to Balmoral and a trip to the royal box at Ascot. Andrew stepped down from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous interview, but the publication of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, and the US government’s release of documents from Epstein’s estate, brought more scrutiny over his relationship with the financier. It led to the King officially stripping his disgraced brother of both his HRH style and his prince title. US politicians have criticised Andrew for his “silence” after he missed a deadline last month to respond to their request to sit for an interview about Epstein. He paid millions to Ms Giuffre, a woman he has claimed never to have met, to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Construction crews and drones searched the rubble of a nursing home Wednesday, a day after a powerful explosion killed at least two people, collapsed part of the building and left several residents unaccounted for. Emergency responders from across the region dug through debris and evacuated residents amid flames, smoke, a strong smell of gas and even a second explosion, Gov. The blast at the 174-bed nursing home in Township, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of , happened shortly after a utility crew responded to reports of a gas odor at the facility, authorities said. Investigators are examining whether a gas leak caused the explosion, a finding officials cautioned remains preliminary. The town’s fire chief, Kevin Dippolito, said at the Tuesday evening news conference that five people were still unaccounted for, but he cautioned that some may have left the scene with family members. The first report of an explosion at the Bristol Health & Rehab Center came at around 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, authorities said. Dippolito described a chaotic rescue in which firefighters found people trapped in stairwells and elevator shafts and pulled residents from windows and doors. Two people were rescued from a collapsed section of the building. Firefighters handed patients to police officers waiting outside, including one officer “who literally threw two people over his shoulders,” Dippolito said. Rescuers used search dogs, heavy equipment and sonar to locate potential victims. Willie Tye, who lives about a block away, said he was watching a basketball game when he heard a loud boom. “I thought an airplane or something came and fell on my house,” he said. When he went outside, he saw “fire everywhere” and people fleeing the building. The local gas utility, PECO, said its crews were responding to reports of a gas odor when the explosion occurred. The company said it shut off natural gas and electric service to the facility to protect first responders and nearby residents. “It is not known at this time if PECO’s equipment, or natural gas, was involved in this incident,” the utility said in a statement. Investigators from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission’s went to the scene. A utility commission spokesperson said a determination that a gas leak caused the explosion cannot be confirmed until investigators examine the site. Musuline Watson, who said she was a certified nursing assistant at the facility, told WPVI-TV that staff smelled gas over the weekend but did not initially suspect a serious problem because there was no heat in that room. The nursing home recently became affiliated with Saber Healthcare Group and was previously known as Silver Lake Healthcare Center. Saber called the explosion “devastating” in a statement and said facility personnel promptly reported the gas odor to PECO before the blast. The company said it was cooperating with authorities to ensure the safety of residents, staff and the surrounding community. State inspection records show the facility was cited for multiple violations during an October inspection by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, including failing to provide accurate floor plans, properly maintain stairways and fire extinguishers on one level. Inspectors also cited the facility for lacking required smoke barrier partitions designed to contain smoke across floors. According to Medicare.gov, the facility underwent a standard fire safety inspection in September 2024 and received no citations. Medicare’s overall rating of the facility is listed as “much below average,” with poor ratings for health inspections in particular. , Pennsylvania.

The state most impacted by the outbreak is Pennsylvania, which has recorded 10 cases so far. California and Texas have both reported two cases, whereas Florida has reported three. Salmonella is caused by bacteria, usually spread through consuming contaminated food. Its symptoms start six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria and often include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover without treatment after four to seven days. However, some vulnerable people – including children under five years old, adults 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems – may experience more severe illnesses that require medical treatment or hospitalization, the CDC warned.

Johnson’s once iron grip on the House floor schedule and his desire to never, ever permit anything to happen that would displease Trump have left members feeling powerless while serving in what is supposed to be the most powerful chamber in the most powerful branch of government — the legislative branch.

Read our An argument over an NFL game turned deadly just days before Christmas, leaving a woman murdered, her husband dead by suicide, and her 13-year-old daughter critically wounded. The violence unfolded Monday night in Lakeland, Florida, after a dispute between Jason Kenney, 47, and his wife, Crystal Kenney, over watching the end of a Monday Night Football game, According to investigators, Kenney had been drinking throughout the night and was initially inside a shed on the property before going into the home to watch the football game in the living room, where his wife was. When Crystal said she did not want to watch football, the argument intensified. At one point, Crystal yelled for her 12-year-old son to call 911. He ran to a neighbor’s house as gunshots rang out. Deputies arrived minutes later to find Crystal Kenney dead in the living room with a gunshot wound to the head. They also found her 13-year-old daughter suffering from two gunshot wounds – one to the shoulder and one to the face. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she remains in critical but stable condition. ""She said, 'I begged him, don't shoot me, don't shoot me, don't shoot me, and he shot me anyway,'"" Judd said. “He just absolutely destroyed a family,” the sheriff added. “Literally. Not to mention the mental health of two children without their mother and a father three days before Christmas.” The couple’s one-year-old baby girl was also inside the home at the time. She was found asleep in her crib and was unharmed. After shooting his wife and stepdaughter, investigators say Kenney fled the scene in his truck. He called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, and told her he had done something “really bad” and was not going to jail. Deputies later located Kenney hiding in a shed at his late father’s home in Lake Wales. When deputies ordered him to come outside, they heard a single gunshot and Kenney was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. “The entire family was destroyed,” Judd said. “And I must tell you, our homicide detectives are distraught. When they go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree just like the nuclear family should be.” This is not the first time Kenney had been abusive, according to neighbors, though the sheriff’s office said there were no prior calls for service at the home. Kenney had no criminal history. Judd, however, pointed out a handwritten note that was found inside the home that Crystal Kenney had written at some point in the past. “We found a note that at some time in the past Crystal wrote, and it was open, where she told Jason, you know, ‘You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again, this is not the way the family should be. You need God,’” Judd said. The surviving children, two of whom were from Crystal’s from a previous relationship, and the couple’s baby, are now in the care of their grandparents. ”This is horrific, but destroying a family and the mental health of these children so close to Christmas is especially horrific,” Judd said. “We will do everything we can to help this family get through this difficult time.”",The Independent,The Independent

Hamas insists it does not know where Ran Gvili’s remains are. The ceasefire deal, which began on 10 October, has seen the return of 20 living hostages and all remaining dead hostages barring Ran.

Weiss said she pulled the segment because “we do not present the administration’s argument” for sending Venezuelans to CECOT, and requested “numerous changes,” including a suggestion that it feature a new interview with Miller, according to Miller said that he didn’t “remember getting anything” when Hurt asked whether he was “contacted about this package.” “I don't remember anybody reaching out to me. As you know, people put things into comms inboxes and general feedback comments,” Miller said, before pivoting. “But more fundamentally, this is another pathetic staff, journalist Alfonsi said that she and her team “requested responses to questions and/or interviews with DHS, the White House and the State Department” but received no response. “Government silence is a statement, not a veto. Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” Alfonsi said. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she continued. that Weiss arranged a “big managers' crisis meeting” in CBS News' New York offices to address the fallout from spiking the CECOT story. According to sources familiar with the meeting, Weiss spent much of the time assuring attendees that the segment was not dead and would eventually air on The segment was leaked online this week after a recording aired on Canada’s Global Television Network. The story appears to have been taken down, but it is still on a website that captures and preserves webpages after they are removed. Numerous deportees in the leaked video report torture, beatings and abuse. One Venezuelan deportee featured in the leaked video reported being punished with sexual abuse and solitary confinement. Another deportee said guards beat him and broke his bones as soon as he arrived. “When you get there, you already know you're in hell. You don't need anyone to tell you,” he said. The story featured numerous experts who called into question the legal basis for deporting migrants so hastily amidst pending judicial decisions.",The Independent,The Independent

Matters such as territorial questions must be discussed at the leaders’ level.” Asked about the plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow would set out its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US envoys in Florida over the weekend. The recent proposal comes after weeks of modifying an earlier 28-point plan, which was heavily criticised by Ukraine and Nato leaders. Below are the points of the draft proposal as unveiled by Mr Zelensky and shared by his office on Wednesday. 2. This point will envisage a full and unquestionable non-aggression agreement between Russia and Ukraine. It specifies that to sustain long-term peace, a monitoring mechanism will be established to oversee the line of contact through space-based unmanned monitoring, to ensure early notification of violations, and to resolve conflicts. 4. Ukraine will maintain its armed forces at their present strength of 800,000 personnel. The earlier US draft had called for Ukraine to reduce the size of its forces. 5. The United States, Nato, and European countries will provide Ukraine with security guarantees that mirror Article 5, the mutual-defence clause of Nato’s founding treaty. 6. Russia will formalise a policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine in all necessary laws and all required documents on ratification, including ratification by an overwhelming majority vote in the State Duma. 7. Ukraine will become an EU member at a specifically defined date. Ukraine will also receive short-term preferential access to the European market. 8. Ukraine will receive a strong global development package, which will be defined in a separate agreement on investment and future prosperity. 9. Several funds will be established to address economic recovery, the reconstruction of damaged areas and regions, and humanitarian issues. The objective will be to mobilise $800bn to help Ukraine fully realise its potential. 10. Ukraine will accelerate the process of concluding a free-trade agreement with the United States. Zelensky said the US position was that if Washington were to grant free trade access to Ukraine, it aimed to offer similar terms to Russia. 11. Ukraine will confirm that it will remain a non-nuclear state, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 12. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelensky said no agreement had yet been reached with the United States on the issue of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is located near the front line in territory now controlled by Russian forces. Zelensky said the US proposal was for the plant to be operated jointly by Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, each holding equal stakes in a joint enterprise, with the Americans acting as the chief managers. Kyiv’s proposal was for the plant to be operated by a 50-50 joint enterprise involving only the United States and Ukraine, with Ukraine receiving half of the energy produced and the United States independently allocating the other half. 13. Ukraine and Russia commit to implementing educational programmes in schools and across society that promote understanding and tolerance toward different cultures and eliminate racism and prejudice. Ukraine will implement European Union rules on religious tolerance and the protection of minority languages. 14. Territory: Zelensky said that this was the most complex point, and as yet unresolved. Russia wants Ukraine to withdraw troops from territory Ukraine still controls in the eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv wants the fighting to be halted at current battle lines. Washington has proposed demilitarised zones and a free economic zone in the part of the Donetsk region that Kyiv controls. 15. After reaching an agreement on future territorial arrangements, both Russia and Ukraine undertake not to alter these agreements by force. 16. Russia will not obstruct Ukraine from using the Dnipro River and the Black Sea for commercial purposes. A separate maritime agreement and an access agreement will be concluded, covering freedom of navigation and transport. The Kinburn Spit, along the Dnipro’s outlet to the sea, will be demilitarised. 17. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues: a) All remaining prisoners of war will be exchanged on the principle of All for All. b) All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children. c) Provisions will be made to address the suffering of victims from the conflict. 18. Ukraine must hold elections as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement. 19. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by a Peace Council, chaired by Donald Trump. Ukraine, Europe, Nato, Russia, and the United States will be part of this mechanism. Sanctions will apply in case of violations. 20. Once all parties agree to this agreement, a full ceasefire will take effect immediately.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our said it is “fully committed to upholding the right to free speech”, after the head of a campaign group aimed at preventing the spread of online hate and disinformation was barred from entering the United States. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is one of five Europeans sanctioned by the US. had accused them of leading “efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose”. The Trump administration has signalled the sanctions could be followed by further action potentially targeting serving politicians or officials. Mr Ahmed, from Manchester, has links to senior figures, having previously worked as an adviser to now-Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn, during his time as shadow foreign secretary. , was listed as a director at the CCDH before resigning in April 2020, according to Companies House records. Responding to the sanctions, a UK Government spokesperson said: “The UK is fully committed to upholding the right to free speech. “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content. “Social media platforms should not be used to disseminate child sex abuse material, incite hatred and violence, or spread fake information and videos for that purpose.” Terror law watchdog Jonathan Hall KC said the imposition of sanctions by the US was a “significant move”. The independent reviewer of terror legislation told Times Radio: “Sanctions are generally reserved for really serious matters of foreign policy where a country feels that its own interests are being severely threatened or where the world order feels threatened.” He added that “it will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject at the moment”. declared “war” on the CCDH, branding it a “criminal organisation”. At the time, Mr Ahmed told The Guardian they were going to “tirelessly” continue their work. He previously told the Triggernometry podcast he was inspired to start the CCDH after seeing the rise of antisemitism on the left in the UK and the murder of his colleague, Labour MP Jo Cox, by a white supremacist, who was radicalised, in part, online. Clare Melford, another British-based executive who runs the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), was also identified as one of the five Europeans who will be barred from entering the US by Sarah Rogers, the US government’s under secretary of state for public diplomacy. A GDI spokesperson said the visa sanctions were “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. “The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.” The action to bar them from the United States is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions. In a post on X, Mr Rubio said: “For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organised efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. “The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.” Ms Rogers said: “None of those sanctioned is a current UK or EU official – however, we know that foreign government officials are actively targeting the United States. “This week, the UK’s Liberal Democrats claimed President Trump’s national security strategy amounts to foreign interference by a hostile foreign state because it correctly identifies mass migration and decaying national sovereignty as existential European security concerns.” The Lib Dems accused the US administration of using “bullying tactics” against critics. The Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesman, Calum Miller, said: “Donald Trump has made it his explicit policy to interfere in European politics and ‘cultivate resistance’ in the UK and elsewhere. Nobody expects that to stop with words. “Trump and his backers plan to pour money into British and European politics to try to change the outcomes of elections. “That is different from the right to speak out and scrutinise the powerful. Trump likes to dish it out but not to take criticism. “These sanctions are an attack on free speech and amount to bullying tactics. The Government must stand up for its citizens, not stay silent.” Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner, and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of the German non-profit HateAid, have also been barred. French president Emmanuel Macron condemned the sanctions, accusing the US of “intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. On X, he wrote: “The rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe. “Together with the European Commission and our European partners, we will continue to defend our digital sovereignty and our regulatory autonomy.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “The decision by the US to impose travel restrictions on European citizens and officials is unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty. “Europe will keep defending its values: freedom of expression, fair digital rules, and the right to regulate our own space.”",The Independent,The Independent

Looking further back, there is one president with a worse approval rating than Trump at the end of the first year of their second term, , who scored 30 percent in December 1973. However, the comparison is not exact as Nixon’s two terms were consecutive whereas Trump is the first American president to mount a successful comeback after defeat since Grover Cleveland in 1892. that Trump began his belated second term in January with the highest job-approval rating he has ever scored as president, with Gallup placing him at 50 percent. meanwhile placed him at 51.6 percent on the day after his second inauguration was held in the U.S. Capitol, an event driven indoors by bitter winter cold. His disapproval rating at that time was 40 percent, leaving him with a positive net approval rating of 11.6 percent overall, a state of play that continued until March 12, at which point it slumped into negative territory and remained there for the rest of the year. A significant slump occurred on April 2, the day Trump unveiled his on other nations from the Rose Garden, which inspired such an adverse reaction from the markets that he was forced to pause the levies again a week later.

While Gallup’s monthly polling of Republican voters shows only a 2 percent decline for Trump from January’s high of 91 percent approval to 89 percent now, among independents his support has almost halved from 46 percent at inauguration time to 25 percent. That could be read as an ill omen for the GOP ahead of next year’s midterms, which are likely to serve as an effective referendum on his administration, even though the president himself will not be on the ballot. Another recent survey conducted by Quinnipiac University found that a majority of American voters across all parties believe Trump has in his first year back in the Oval. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the poll said they felt Trump had exceeded his authority while another 37 percent said they believed he had got the balance broadly right.

That came just over a week after her nine-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son were found dead in their home in Colorado Springs. Her 11-year-old daughter was injured but survived. The girl told an investigator that her mother said that God made her do it, according to court documents in the UK. Singler, who had superficial knife wounds, told police that a man who entered the apartment was responsible for the attack. She was initially considered a victim. Her surviving daughter backed up Singler’s claim at first, but police sought to arrest Singler on 26 December 2023 after they said the girl changed her story. By then, Singler was gone. She was found four days later in London’s upscale Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. It is not known why she ended up there. Singler, 37, fought extradition and denied attacking her children. Her London defence attorney, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that Singler should not be extradited because if convicted of first-degree murder in Colorado, she would face a mandatory sentence of life without parole — a sentence that violates European human rights law. Singler does not yet have a US-based attorney listed as representing her in court documents, according to the court clerk’s office. A judge rejected Singler’s challenge in January 2025, and her bid for an appeal was rejected in November. Singler has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the two children. The family had been staying with Singler’s mother during the custody battle, but the mother was away at the time, according to court documents in the U.K. Singler also faces one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault. According to UK court documents, the children’s bodies were found by police shortly after midnight on 19 December 2023. Police said they found no footprints in the snow leading to a patio where Singler said an intruder entered through an unlocked door and attacked her, causing her to lose consciousness. She told police that her ex-husband “had previously dreamt about killing his family, that the children’s father was always trying to ‘frame her’ and ‘get her arrested’ and to have the kids taken away from her,” Judge John Zani said in a January ruling against Singler in Westminster Magistrates’ Court. Police said GPS records showed that her ex-husband was driving a truck at the time of the killings, about 80 miles (130km) away. The day before the bodies of the children were found, a judge in Colorado ordered Singler to comply with a previous order to allow the father to take custody of them for the holidays, according to state court records. She was told to either give the children to her ex-husband on her own or bring them to a 20 December 2023 court hearing to exchange custody of them there. On the day of the hearing, Singler asked the judge to delay it, writing in a motion that she and her children had been attacked and that two of the children were murdered. She asked for time to grieve the loss of her children and “gain my bearings after this incident.”",The Independent,The Independent

Other Europeans hit with travel bans were the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton, and Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of German organisation HateAid.

The Trump administration has signalled the sanctions could be followed by further action potentially targeting serving politicians or officials. said it was “fully committed” to free speech and supporting “the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content”. Mr Ahmed, who lives in Washington DC, has links to senior Labour figures, having previously worked as an adviser to now-Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn, during his time as shadow foreign secretary. Additionally, Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, was listed as a director at the CCDH before resigning in April 2020, according to Companies House records. Dame Chi Onwurah, the Labour chairwoman of the Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, said: “Banning people because you disagree with what they say undermines the free speech the administration claims to seek. “We desperately need a wide-ranging debate on whether and how social media should be regulated in the interests of the people. “Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content. He was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability. “Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.” Terror law watchdog Jonathan Hall KC said the imposition of sanctions by the US was a “significant move”. The independent reviewer of terror legislation told Times Radio: “Sanctions are generally reserved for really serious matters of foreign policy where a country feels that its own interests are being severely threatened or where the world order feels threatened.” He added that “it will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject at the moment”. A GDI spokesperson said the visa sanctions on Ms Melford were “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.” The action to bar them from the United States is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law against its targets. In a post on X, Mr Rubio said: “For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organised efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. “The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.” Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers hinted the action could spread wider: “None of those sanctioned is a current UK or EU official, however, we know that foreign government officials are actively targeting the United States. “This week, the UK’s Liberal Democrats claimed President Trump’s national security strategy amounts to foreign interference by a hostile foreign state because it correctly identifies mass migration and decaying national sovereignty as existential European security concerns.” The Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesman, Calum Miller, said: “Donald Trump has made it his explicit policy to interfere in European politics and ‘cultivate resistance’ in the UK and elsewhere. Nobody expects that to stop with words. “Trump and his backers plan to pour money into British and European politics to try to change the outcomes of elections. “That is different from the right to speak out and scrutinise the powerful.

On X, he wrote: “The rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe. “Together with the European Commission and our European partners, we will continue to defend our digital sovereignty and our regulatory autonomy.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “The decision by the US to impose travel restrictions on European citizens and officials is unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty. “Europe will keep defending its values: freedom of expression, fair digital rules, and the right to regulate our own space.”",The Independent,The Independent

In new spectacular footage, the shooting lava reaches as high as 1,400 feet, higher than the Eiffel Tower. Fountains in the 39th episode since the current eruption began in December 2024 lasted for 5.9 hours and produced an estimated 13 million cubic yards (10 million cubic meters) of lava, the USGS said. “This by far is the most amazing thing I’ve seen in my life in terms of Hawaiian volcanism,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told “It’s built up a big wedge that’s over 200 feet thick of lava on the surface of the lava lake.

Contained with a park some 200 miles south of the state’s largest city, Honolulu, eruptions pose no immediate danger to residential areas. However the USGS have said eruptions can have far-reaching effects downwind. This is because as sulfur dioxide is continuously released from the summit during an eruption, it will react in the atmosphere to create the visible haze known as vog (volcanic smog) downwind of Kilauea. These chemical combined may cause respiratory and other problems at high concentrations. The episodes so far have varied immensely in size and duration, with episode 38 in November having had the “highest effusion rate” of 1,000 to 1,2000 cubic yards per second, which refers to the amount of magma or lava dispersed through a vent at once. During ongoing eruptive episodes, the summit region of Kilauea deflates, as that had been stored within the volcano erupts on the surface. Between eruptive episodes, the summit consistently inflates, as magma accumulates within shallow storage areas. The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) analyses this pattern of inflation and deflation to forecast timeframes for when new eruptive episodes can start. The lava fountains during the ongoing Kilauea summit eruptions have formed 140ft of tephras, creating a new puʻu (hill) southwest of Halemaʻumaʻu crater.

Read our With millions of Americans bracing for the cost of their in Congress are mulling whether to use the same partisan tactic they used on the unpopular One Big Beautiful Bill Act this year to force through direct cash payments in line with President ’s most recent musings on health care costs. During an event in the Oval Office earlier this month Trump responded to a question about what he’d like the GOP Congress to do by repeating a line he rolled out several weeks back, pushing the idea of direct payments that, in his estimation, could help Americans defray health care costs even though most people do not purchase insurance individually but as part of a large group, whether through an Affordable Care Act exchange or through an employer. “I want all money going to the people and let the people buy their own health care. It'll be unbelievable. They'll do a great job. They'll get much better health care at a much lower cost,” he said. Now, with midterm elections — and possible electoral devastation — looming over the Republican-led legislative branch, members are struggling over whether they’d be able to cobble together the votes to turn Trump’s seat-of-the-pants, stream-of-consciousness musings into actual legislation. a number of Republicans in both the House and Senate are discussing whether they can use the budget reconciliation process — a parliamentary maneuver that lets certain spending bills pass with bare majorities in the Senate by evading the filibuster — to advance a bill that would use tariff revenue to fund direct cash payments as a way of addressing the Although Trump and his allies frequently claim tariffs are paid by foreign countries as a sort of entry fee for the privilege of having their products sold in American markets, tariffs are actually taxes that are paid by American importers and passed on to consumers in higher prices for finished goods. This means the GOP proposal would essentially give Americans their own money back for meager cash payments that in all likelihood would not cover the higher premiums they will have to pay after Congress allows the ACA subsides to expire in seven days. While the plan has garnered some interest among rank-and-file Republicans, the chairman of the House’s primary tax law-writing committee, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, is skeptical of any reconciliation bill actually making it through either chamber, much less both. “I don’t see a path of a second reconciliation ever passing,” said Smith, a Utah Republican. Representative Mike Lawler, a New York GOP moderate who has endorsed the idea of simply extending the Obamacare subsidies rather than face the wrath of angry voters next November, reportedly said a reconciliation bill would “never” happen. And a key Republican Senator, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, poured cold water on the idea earlier this month. “I don’t want another one-sided, partisan reconciliation bill right now — I want us to legislate,” Murkowski said. “Let’s be legislators here. Reconciliation is, yes, it’s a tool for us, but it’s a partisan tool and look at how divided we are right now. … That’s not the way to go.” But the chairs of the House and Senate budget committees, Republican Representative Jodey Arrington of Texas and GOP Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are more bullish on the prospect. Arrington, who will retire from the House after next year, said he feels there is “a critical mass to start” the reconciliation process, while Graham told that he would like to see a reconciliation bill focused on health care, immigration enforcement and military funding. The Trump tariff rebate proposal has other hurdles it may struggle to clear, most notably the strict rules around what can go in a reconciliation bill. Under the party-line process, only taxation and spending provisions can make it through under Section 313 of the Budget Act and Senate rules requiring “extraneous” provisions — policy changes unrelated to budgeting — from bypassing the upper chamber’s filibuster. But that hasn’t stopped some in the GOP and the Earlier this month, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy James Blair told the White House would support legislation for tariff “dividends” around $2,000 per person in addition to any health care-related provisions in a reconciliation bill. The chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee group, Rep. August Pfluger of Texas, has said he is on board and urged colleagues to “come together and coalesce around policy that works.” But Pfluger said the “trick” to doing so would be first figuring out what Trump wants and going along with it.",The Independent,The Independent

He had been wearing an eye patch on his right eye and a black vest at the time – despite company rules stating that he should’ve been wearing a high-visibility green vest. Statements given to OSHA by a safety manager stated that the forklift operator was talking on the phone while driving. After striking You, the operator “ran away” without checking on the hurt CEO, according to the report.

Trump is not accused of wrongdoing in connection with his crimes, and a person’s appearance within the files does not suggest wrongdoing. The Justice Department immediately , claiming the files contain “untrue and sensationalist claims” that they suggested were used to influence the 2020 presidential election. The administration continues to be dogged by the controversy, hindered further by the heavily redacted files and its “clumsy” and partial release of the documents. There was immediate outcry when the Justice Department failed to release all of the long-awaited files in its possession, despite federal law signed by Trump requiring the administration to publicly disclose everything it had by December 19. “There’s a palpable sense of exasperation and annoyance in the administration about all of the headlines pertaining to Trump and Epstein and the inability to explain everything and just get the disclosure done,” Officials are growing “frustrated” with the saga as it shows few signs of abating. “It’s a combination of extreme frustration at everything: at what Congress did, at our response to it, and a concern that it won’t go away,” an official told the outlet. Many of the 700,000 documents due to be reviewed are duplicates, according to the outlet, and so not all of them will be disclosed, but thousands more are anticipated to drop in the next week. The Justice Department released around 30,000 files Tuesday, and so far, the release of materials which are heavily redacted and mostly shared without any context has not advanced the public’s understanding of the scope of Epstein’s crimes and connections to an alleged sex trafficking ring accused of exploiting and abusing young girls. References to Trump were prominent in the latest batch, which prompted the department to issue a statement claiming some of the evidence is “fake.” “There has been lots of sensationalism and even outright lies these past few days about the ‘Epstein Files,’” deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Monday night in a statement on X. “But let’s separate fact from fiction. Document production is just that. We produce documents, and sometimes this can result in releasing fake or false documents because they simply are in our possession because the law requires this.” Blanche pointed to a letter from “J Epstein” from “Manhattan Correctional” to Larry Nassar, the former women’s gymnastics team doctor convicted of exploiting and sexually assaulting hundreds of young athletes, that was among documents released by the Justice Department. The letter is postmarked August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein’s death. It was marked “return to sender” and discovered in a mailroom more than a month later. “Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls,” the letter read. “When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.” However, hours after publishing the document, the Justice Department determined the letter is “fake.” The writing does not appear to match Epstein’s and was postmarked from Virginia, not New York, where Epstein was jailed, according to the Justice Department. “The so-called Epstein Nassar letter is clearly FAKE,” Blanche continued in the statement. “Wrong handwriting, wrong return address, and postmarked three days after Epstein died. These are not reality. We will continue to produce every document required by law. Let’s not let internet rumor engines outrun the facts.” Other revelations unearthed Tuesday included one message from January 2020 from a federal prosecutor in Manhattan who claimed that flight records showed Trump “traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).” It included the period where prosecutors were preparing to charge in the case against Maxwell. Trump has previously said he was “never on Epstein’s Plane.” There were at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996 in which Trump was a passenger, according to the message. Maxwell was also present on at least four of those flights, according to an assistant U.S. attorney, whose name is redacted. In addition, the documents include several tips collected by the FBI about Trump’s involvement with Epstein and parties at their properties in the early 2000s. The messages do not state whether any follow-up investigations were pursued or if the allegations are corroborated. A message from an investigator in June 2021 reported an image with Trump with Maxwell that was discovered on Steve Bannon’s phone. Investigators also identified at least 10 co-conspirators in Epstein’s sex trafficking case in 2019, none of whom have been publicly revealed, according to the newly released documents. That finding is despite testimony from FBI Director Kash Patel, who told senators earlier this year there was “no credible information” that Epstein trafficked women and girls to anyone but himself. Three of those alleged co-conspirators lived in Florida and were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury. There were others in Boston, New York City and Connecticut, according to emails from July 2019. One is a “wealthy business man in Ohio,” according to one message. After Epstein’s death in 2019, prosecutors produced several memos determining whether to charge alleged conspirators in his case, according to the documents. But the files released by the Justice Department only reference the memos — not the documents themselves. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago in his first public remarks about the documents Monday night, the president said Epstein was “all over Palm Beach” and many people crossed paths with him. “You probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago,” Trump said. “A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they’re in a picture with him because he was at a party, and you ruin the reputation of somebody.”",The Independent,The Independent

In the nation’s first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually. The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship’s passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports. Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares. “Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawai‘i and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,” association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement. Hawaii will continue to defend the law, which requires cruise operators to pay their share of transient accommodation tax to address climate change threats to the state, state Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a statement.

Read our has emerged victorious from a lawsuit claiming that it lied to investors about shrinking its portion sizes to cut ingredient costs. In a ruling last week, a federal judge in California found there was no evidence the fast casual chain's executives had lied to shareholders about its portions, despite much ""viral criticism"". , especially when ordered online rather than in person. Chipotle denied it and then-CEO Brian Niccol was On Thursday last week Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett of the U.S. District Court sided with Chipotle and dismissed the lawsuit, which was filed last November by disgruntled investor Michael Stradford. ""The facts alleged do not show Niccol and [food safety officer Laurie] Schalow made a false or misleading statement by denying that the Company had reduced the size of its portions,"" wrote Garnett. Whistleblower testimony cited by Stradford's attorneys amounted to ""vague hearsay"", she said, and were not sufficient to show that Chipotle had systematically reduced portions. ""Instead, the most plausible inference from the allegations set forth in the complaint is that Defendants honestly believed the Company had not changed the size of its portions,"" Garnett concluded. It's not yet clear whether Stradford will appeal the verdict. Criticism of Chipotle's portions began to bubble up through social media in late 2023 and 2024, after ""Hey Chipotle, we need to talk,"" said TikTok comedian and consumer advocate Ryan Lynch in watched by 5.5 million people. ""Your portion control is causing people to be very frustrated... and we all are personally taking out on your employees."" ""The CEO of Chipotle must have never gotten an online order before,"" snarked Barstool Sports for barging behind the counter and shooting a Chipotle employee because he felt that his guacamole portion was too small. Many other customers took to filming staff with their smartphones while their orders were being prepared, based on viral tips claiming it would ensure they got bigger portions (though Chipotle denied this). Some reports indicated the problem was consistency more than pure size. One Wells Fargo financial analyst ordered 75 burrito bowls from eight different New York City Chipotles, and discovered that portion sizes had varied wildly. On an earnings call last July, Niccol acknowledge the inconsistencies, and promised that customers would get ""generous portions"" in future. “We are reemphasizing training and coaching around ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correctly,” he said. In the lawsuit, Stradford's attorneys argued that this and other vows from Chipotle executives were evidence that they had lied when they said the company had not reduced portions across the board. They cited ""confidential sources"" who alleged that between 2020 and 2022, company managers decided they were giving too much food for customers, and sought to cut costs by pressuring individual restaurants to obey strict limits on ingredient usage. ""According to a former Chipotle Field Leader and Regional Training Manager, the easiest way to achieve an acceptable [ingredient usage] was by skimping on portions, which Chipotle employees did all the time because they were afraid of losing their jobs,"" Stradford's amended complaint in April 2025 alleged. But Judge Garnett ruled that these claims were not enough to show that portion sizes had actually been ""systematically reduced"", or that executives had known about the problem and lied to investors about it.",The Independent,The Independent

Scientists seem to think so,2025-12-24T21:22:10.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our We’ve all had the feeling. You’re embarrassed and then there it is: a warm flush creeping up your neck and across your cheeks. The more you think about it, the hotter and redder you get. If someone asks “are you blushing?” it only makes you blush more. So, why do we do it? When we’re already self-conscious, this involuntary response can feel like an added punishment. But evolutionary suggests blushing may actually have social advantages. Let’s take a look. It’s caused by a short burst of increased blood flow to the skin of the ears, face, neck or chest. When an emotion triggers blushing, the sympathetic nervous system – which controls automatic body functions – becomes active and releases adrenaline (epinephrine). This makes the tiny In the body, adrenaline tightens blood vessels, but in the face it does the opposite – they dilate. This means more blood flows through to the skin and makes the face feel hot. We turn red because of this sudden rush of blood close to the surface of the skin. People with lighter skin tones show this redness more clearly. In darker skin tones, the change may be less visible or not visible at all – but the same physiological No matter whether others can see it, you’ll still feel warmth or tingling in your face. People blush when they are feeling highly self-conscious, which is generally brought on by unwanted social attention. So even though the “fight-or-flight” system is involved, blushing isn’t about preparing for danger. Instead, scientists think it evolved as a social signal, a way of showing others that we recognise a mistake or feel embarrassed. This can actually help build trust, because people often see blushing as a sign of honesty or sincerity – especially as it’s involuntary. Blushing can signal a non-verbal apology for a social misstep that can help to maintain social bonds after a transgression. Different emotions can make us blush – but the mechanism is the same: increasing blood flow to the face and making us feel hot. The difference is that blushing in anger, for example, comes from arousal and frustration, while blushing from embarrassment comes from self-awareness and social emotion. People will blush for different reasons. For example, one study found children with social anxiety blushed from embarrassment when given exaggerated praise, compared to moderate praise or none. In a follow-up study, the researchers found kids found who scored highly for narcissism – meaning they had an exaggerated sense of self-importance, wanted admiration and lacked empathy – blushed only when given moderate praise. Researchers suggested this was because the praise given didn’t match how well the child believed they performed. Women and younger people blush more. This may explain why it is often associated with youth, vitality and fertility. People with social anxiety are also more likely to blush. But as we age and have more life experience, we tend to blush less. This may indicate we are more familiar with social norms – or less bothered if we transgress them. People with facial erythema (persistent facial redness) are often mistakenly seen as blushing. But this condition can have a variety of causes, including rosacea, allergic contact dermatitis, reactions to medication and lupus erythematosus (a chronic autoimmune disease). Some primates have pale facial skin that can blush, such as Japanese macaques and bald uakaris. For mandrills, another kind of primate, blushing plays an important role in fertility. Females have a dark face when young and after giving birth. But their faces become bright red during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle, advertising their fertility. When male mandrills are in the presence of fertile females, their faces become redder as they produce more testosterone. Human make-up trends may be evoking similar fertility and attraction rituals, whether consciously or unconsciously. Amanda Meyer is a Senior Lecturer, Anatomy and Pathology in the College of Medicine and Dentistry and Monika Zimanyi is an Associate Professor in Anatomy, both at James Cook University. This article is republished from For example, TikTok and Instagram are awash with people “addicted” to blush using hashtags such as #Blushaholics and #BlushBlindness. Heavy blush is also popularly worn by K-Pop bands – and not only female groups. Because blushing is an involuntary reaction, you can’t stop a blush once it’s coming on. However, if you have a blush that lasts more than a few days, is accompanied by pain, or is distressing to you due to cosmetic concerns, talk to your GP or health professional. Cognitive behavioural therapy (a kind of talk therapy that helps reframe unhelpful thoughts and behaviours) may benefit people who blush because of social anxiety. In rare cases where the cause is an overactive sympathetic nervous system, surgery may be recommended. There are two kinds: a sympathectomy removes a piece of the sympathetic chain – a long chain of nerve fibres running beside the spine; while a sympathicotomy cuts this chain near the second rib, where it joins this spine. Evidence suggests these procedures are effective and can improve quality of life for people with severe symptoms. But for most people, blushing won’t require medical intervention. If you can get through the embarrassment, this involuntary response can be a chance to reflect on your body’s signals, and what they reveal about yourself and how you connect with the world.",The Independent,The Independent

As of last Friday, the facility’s facade now reads ""The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts."" The White House stated that a board handpicked by the president approved the decision, though scholars contend this violates existing law. Trump had reportedly been advocating for the name change for months. Redd, a renowned drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Brown, has hosted ""Jazz Jams"" at the Kennedy Center since 2006. He explained his decision in an email: ""When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert."" The Kennedy Center has not yet responded to requests for comment, though its website confirms the show’s cancellation. The center was established as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy following his assassination in 1963, with Congress passing a law the subsequent year. This legislation explicitly forbids the board of trustees from designating the centre as a memorial to anyone else, or from placing another individual’s name on its exterior. Kennedy’s niece, Kerry Kennedy, has pledged to remove Trump’s name once he leaves office, while former House historian Ray Smock is among those asserting that any such changes require congressional approval.

Read our A Californian mother has described her baby’s birth as a ""miracle"" after he developed outside her womb, hidden by a basketball-sized ovarian cyst, a situation so rare that doctors plan to document the case for a medical journal. Suze Lopez, a 41-year-old nurse from Bakersfield, was unaware she was pregnant with her second child until days before giving birth to her son, Ryu. Her pregnancy was an abdominal one, where the foetus grows in the abdomen rather than the uterus, a condition occurring in just 1 in 30,000 pregnancies. Those that reach full term are ""essentially unheard of — far, far less than 1 in a million,"" according to Dr John Ozimek, medical director of labour and delivery at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where Ryu was born. ""I mean, this is really insane,"" he added. For months, Lopez believed her growing belly was due to an enlarging ovarian cyst, which doctors had been monitoring since her twenties. She experienced none of the typical pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness or foetal kicks, and her irregular menstrual cycle meant a missed period raised no alarms. She and her husband, Andrew Lopez, even traveled abroad during this time. However, as abdominal pain and pressure intensified, Lopez decided it was time to have the 22-pound (10-kilogram) cyst removed. A routine pregnancy test, required before a CT scan due to radiation exposure, delivered the astonishing news: she was pregnant. Lopez shared the news with her husband at a baseball game in August, presenting him with a note and a baby onesie. He recalled seeing her face, ""and she just looked like she wanted to weep and smile and cry at the same time."" Shortly after, Lopez sought help at Cedars-Sinai due to dangerously high blood pressure. Scans revealed her uterus was empty, but a nearly full-term fetus in an amniotic sac was nestled in a small space in her abdomen, near her liver. Dr Ozimek noted it appeared ""mostly implanted on the sidewall of the pelvis, which is also very dangerous but more manageable than being implanted in the liver."" Dr Cara Heuser, a maternal-fetal specialist not involved in the case, explained that most ectopic pregnancies, which implant outside the uterus, rupture and haemorrhage if not removed. Fetal mortality in such cases can be as high as 90%, with birth defects seen in about 1 in 5 surviving babies. Defying all odds, Lopez and her son survived. On August 8, a medical team delivered an 8-pound (3.6-kilogram) baby while Lopez was under full anaesthesia, removing the cyst during the same surgery. She lost nearly all her blood, but the team controlled the bleeding and administered transfusions. Andrew Lopez described his terror during the ordeal: ""The whole time, I might have seemed calm on the outside, but I was doing nothing but praying on the inside. It was just something that scared me half to death, knowing that at any point I could lose my wife or my child."" Both mother and baby recovered well. Ryu, named after a baseball player and a video game character, is now healthy and thriving. As his first Christmas approaches, Lopez feels ""blessed beyond measure."" ""I do believe in miracles,"" she said, looking at her baby. ""God gave us this gift — the best gift ever.""",The Independent,The Independent

Attempting to will that hope into reality, he laid a place at the table for him. But as darkness fell, the devastating realisation crept in that Lee would not be coming home. He still hasn’t. “I had hoped Lee might come home or we might hear from him – obviously I wanted him to come home for Christmas,” Mr Boxell told . “We had an extra space at the table for him for Christmas dinner in case he came home.

Lee Boxell, who would now be 52, disappeared on an ordinary, warm late summer’s day on 10 September 1988. When the sleepy 15-year-old came downstairs at the family home in Cheam still in his pyjamas, Mr Boxell recalled: “I told Lee where we were all going and asked him if he had any plans. He just mumbled something, and I thought, ‘Well, he’s still not really awake yet, so I just won’t worry him.’ We left then – and that was the last time I ever saw Lee.” It was when darkness fell that evening, and Lee – a “lovely, caring” boy who loved football and never got into trouble – had still not returned home, that the close-knit family began to panic. “It was like a living nightmare,” Mr Boxell said. “We were up all night. We couldn’t sleep, just listening for the phone to ring or the doorbell to ring, thinking Lee would come home – but nothing.” Searches were launched and appeals issued, with police taking the case especially seriously because there was “no reason” for Lee to go missing, Mr Boxell said. His son had just £10 on him and the clothes he was wearing. It has now been 37 “very hard” Christmases since that day. “Christmas is a difficult time for us because we don’t know whether he’s going to come home again or whether he is still alive,” Mr Boxell said. “We always think of Lee at Christmas and wonder where he could be, if he is alive, and if he is safe and well. “But fortunately, I have a daughter, and she’s given us two lovely grandchildren. “My grandson, especially, reminds me so much of my son. When he was little, I used to call him Lee – I couldn’t help it.” Deirdre Fenech’s daughter Carmel went missing in 1998, after the 16-year-old was last seen at Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court in London. The three decades since have been horrendous for the family, and Ms Fenech said Christmas remains one of the hardest times. “It’s very difficult,” she said. “The first couple of years, I was still buying presents, and we’d put them under the tree, and we’d keep them there.” Each year, Carmel’s family would add to the pile, Ms Fenech said. “I just couldn’t keep looking at them, and in the end, I gave them all away. Now, I don’t buy anything. I just think if she comes home at Christmas, she doesn’t need a pile of presents under the tree. I will take her in and buy her whatever she wants.” Natasha Walker’s sister, Katrice Lee, vanished from a supermarket on her second birthday in 1981. That first Christmas, her family wrapped gifts and placed them under the tree in case she came home. Christmases since then have remained an especially painful time, Ms Walker said. “It’s just really bloody hard,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking because you can see other people’s families celebrating, and although you’re celebrating, you still have that one person missing. “I’ll never, ever forget Katrice. There’s never going to be a time where I’m not going to get up on Christmas Day and think, ‘Gosh, I wish she was here with me.’” Ms Walker said Katrice’s birthday and the anniversary of her going missing both fall close to Christmas, which compounds their heartache at this time of year. “It’s always really sad,” she said. “My dad will light a candle every Christmas Eve for Katrice, and I normally light a candle for Katrice. “It’s just really difficult because there is that one person missing – you’re not sharing the joy of Christmas, and gifts.” In a message to other families who are also spending Christmas without a missing loved one, Mr Boxell said: “I think they’ve got to try and enjoy Christmas as best they can for the sake of their other family members... [and] to try to think of the good times with their loved one who’s gone missing. I think that’s all they can do, really. We did have lots of good times with our son.” Mr Boxell, who has been involved with Missing People since its founding and is a , also threw his support behind the SafeCall campaign. “I think SafeCall is a brilliant idea, especially for youngsters who are thinking they might have to leave home, or if they’ve already left home,” he said. “If they can call the charity, they’ll be helped enormously.

They’ll help keep them safe, because it is a dangerous world out there.” threw his backing behind the campaign, joining actor and writer , campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen, former England football captain will continue to raise money for the cause into the new year to raise vital funds to support the running of the new helpline when the service launches.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Maths teacher Rebecca Joynes, 31, was jailed for six and a half years in July last year after being found guilty of six counts of sexual activity with a child, after sleeping with one pupil before falling pregnant by a second while on The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) convened earlier this month via a virtual , which Joynes did not attend, to consider her professional conduct. A panel recommended she be banned from teaching. Marc Cavey, chief executive of the TRA, concluded: “Rebecca Joynes is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Joynes shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.” A jury heard last year that Joynes had cultivated relationships with the boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, over Snapchat messages and groomed them with attention. She bought one boy a £350 Gucci belt during a trip to the Trafford Centre. She would go on to take the boy back to her flat in Salford Quays, where they had sex twice before Joynes told the teenager: “No one had better find out”. But the next day the boy’s mother spotted a love bite on her son’s neck and the police were called. Joynes was suspended pending a police investigation. But this did not stop her from inviting a second boy to her apartment for a “date night” that involved an Ann Summers scratchcard of sexual activities. She became pregnant with the boy and gave birth last year, but the child was taken away from her. The TRA panel said that they found no evidence that Joynes’ qualities as a teacher outweighed the serious nature of the conviction, noting “the profound impact” that Joynes’ offending had on her victims, and that she had “scant regard for the seriousness of her actions”. It found Joynes was in breach of standards, including upholding public trust in the teaching profession and having an understanding of professional duties. Mr Cavey, in his decision, wrote: “I am particularly mindful of the finding of a teacher being convicted of offences involving sexual activity with more than one pupil in this case and the very negative impact that such a finding is likely to have on the reputation of the profession. “I have had to consider that the public has a high expectation of professional standards of all teachers and that the public might regard a failure to impose a prohibition order as a failure to uphold those high standards.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our online have been denied US visas after being accused of seeking to “censor” Americans, as the UK government reaffirmed its stance to “upholding the right to free speech”. Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser and ally of Sir who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) have been labelled “radical activists” by the Trump administration. The pair were among five Europeans, including European Commissioner Thierry Breton, barred from entering the US. said they had led “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”. He added: “These radical activists and weaponised NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states - in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.” The Trump administration has signalled the sanctions could be followed by further action, potentially targeting serving politicians or officials. Mr Ahmed was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn and Sir Keir’s influential chief of staff Morgan McSweeney served as a director at CCDH until 2020. He is reportedly based in the group’s Washington office and so will face deportation from the country as a result of the visa ban. The visa bans are the latest move in a US campaign aimed at European rules intended to regulate social media. Trump officials have ordered US diplomats to build opposition to the ’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), which is intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on tech companies. Following the ban, the UK government said it is “fully committed to upholding the right to free speech”, with a spokesperson saying: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful contact. “Social media platforms should not be used to disseminate child sex abuse material, incite hatred and violence, or spread fake information and videos for that purpose”. Dame Chi Onwurah, the Labour chairwoman of the Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, said: “Banning people because you disagree with what they say undermines the free speech the administration claims to seek. We desperately need a wide-ranging debate on whether and how social media should be regulated in the interests of the people. “Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content. He was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability. Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.” A GDI spokesperson said the visa sanctions on Ms Melford were “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. French former business executive Thierry Breton, who served as the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024, was among those now banned from the US. Two senior figures from the German nonprofit HateAid were also denied visas. A European Commission spokesperson said it “strongly condemns the US decision”, adding: “Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world”. said: “These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. He said that the EU’s digital regulations would “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country, and to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online”. He added in a further statement on the social media platform X that he had spoken with Mr Breton and “thanked him for his significant contributions in the service of Europe”. Meanwhile Germany’s justice ministry said that the two German’s targeted had the government’s “support and solidarity”. They added that the visa bans were unacceptable and said: “Anyone who describes this as censorship is misrepresenting our constitutional system”. Terror law watchdog Jonathan Hall KC said the imposition of sanctions by the US was a “significant move”. The independent reviewer of terror legislation told Times Radio: “Sanctions are generally reserved for really serious matters of foreign policy where a country feels that its own interests are being severely threatened or where the world order feels threatened.”",The Independent,The Independent

They can’t be looking at all your work every day and remembering every little detail. They can’t be a participant in your life to that degree.

From divorces to deaths, and some more Strictly Come Dancing drama, here is a round-up of the most memorable news stories: In the summer, a viral clip taken at a Coldplay concert led to the resignation of a high-powered chief executive who worked at a tech company based in New York. Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot, who both worked at Astronomer, were caught by surprise when the band’s frontman, , asked the cameras to scan the crowd during a concert at Massachusetts, Boston in July. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” Martin, 48, joked when the couple appeared on screen and quickly tried to hide their faces. The clip, which was shared widely online, resulted in a stream of memes and parody videos and was even spoofed on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and Strictly Come Dancing. Through the power of social media the couple were quickly identified and they both resigned from their roles. Later on, in an unexpected move, Astronomer hired US actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who was married to Martin for 13 years, as a spokeswoman. “Astronomer has got a lot of questions over the last few days and they wanted me to answer the most common ones,” Paltrow said in a video where she avoided mention of the KissCam drama.

Perry was also seen holding a daisy which she later held to the air after emerging from the spacecraft to honour her daughter Daisy, before kissing the ground. Bezos then congratulated her to which she replied: “Thank you.” The Fireworks singer said: “I feel super connected to love, so connected to love. “I think this experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, like how much love you have to give and how loved you are until the day you launch.” The singer has also been in the headlines this year following her split from the Pirates Of The Caribbean actor Orlando Bloom, whom she shares her daughter with. Since then Perry has been romantically linked with former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and posted a photo of them to Instagram earlier in the month.

Musicians from Bostin Brass played Black Sabbath songs to accompany the cortege, and fans threw flowers at the hearse while it slowly passed through the city. The heavy metal singer was known for his theatrical stage presence, including once biting off the head of a bat, and styling himself as the Prince of Darkness, which marked him out as a controversial figure. Lily Allen’s fifth studio album, West End Girl, immediately garnered attention in October for its catchy melodies and frank lyrics, which are said to detail the alleged infidelity of the singer’s ex-husband, US actor David Harbour. The record, which was her first for seven years, contains a mix of “truth” and “fantasy”, according to Allen, whose 14-track album goes into explicit detail about the breakdown of a marriage that was “opened” after the “husband went astray”. In an appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in December the singer, 40, was joined by US actress Dakota Johnson, who portrayed the titular enigmatic mistress from her track Madeline, appearing behind a curtain for most of the song. The Fifty Shades Of Grey star also delivered the song’s spoken-word outro, explaining her side of the story via texts to Allen, saying: “He told me that you were aware this was going on and that he had your full consent.” A year on from Strictly Come Dancing’s 20th anniversary, hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly announced they would be leaving their roles following this year’s Christmas special. Daly, 56, had co-hosted alongside the late Sir Bruce Forsyth since the series launch in 2004, while Winkleman, 53, fronted its weekday companion show, It Takes Two. Winkleman, who is also known for presenting The Traitors, eventually moved on to host the Sunday night results show alongside Daly and joined the main show every Saturday from 2014, after Sir Bruce stepped down. The duo picked up the entertainment programme gong at the Bafta TV Awards in 2024 and were made Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the King’s Birthday Honours for their services to broadcasting. Following the announcement, they both shared separate posts on their Instagram pages with a string of photographs. Winkleman said: “It’s very difficult to put into words exactly what Strictly has meant to me. It’s been the greatest relationship of my career.” Daly added: “Thank you for the laughter, the friendship and the countless memories over all these years. You’ve filled my heart in ways I’ll never forget. I’ll miss you all so much.” At the start of the year Charli XCX brought Brat to the Brit Awards when she scooped five awards following the success of her alternative pop album, released in June 2024. She later hit the headlines when she married her long-term partner and drummer of The 1975, George Daniel, and celebrated with family and friends in both Hackney and Italy. In another romantic turn pop star Taylor Swift got engaged to her NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce and shortly afterwards released another chart-topping album, The Life Of A Showgirl. There was also a number of high-profile divorces, with TV presenter Cat Deeley and The Late Late Show presenter Patrick Kielty among the couples announcing their separation. A happier story came in the form of an unlikely relationship that blossomed on ITV’s reboot of Celebrity Big Brother. US dancer JoJo Siwa and reality TV star Chris Hughes batted away rumours they were in a romantic relationship before eventually confirming them to be true in a social media post more than a month after their stint on the reality TV show. Popular TV show Strictly hit headlines in 2024 amid allegations of bullying during rehearsals and the drama continued into 2025 when The Apprentice star Thomas Skinner admitted to cheating on his wife just weeks after their wedding in an interview with the Sun on Sunday, having previously apologised for picking up a journalist’s phone and walking out of a press event for Strictly midway through. He also claimed that his elimination on Strictly was rigged and suggested that he was kicked off the show because he had met US vice president JD Vance.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our announced plans Thursday for a national bravery award to recognize civilians and first responders who confronted “the worst of evil” during an antisemitic terror attack that left 15 dead and has cast a heavy shadow over the nation’s holiday season. Albanese said he plans to establish a special honors system for those who placed themselves in harms way to help during the attack on a beachside Hanukkah celebration, like Ahmed al Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian who disarmed one of the assailants before being wounded himself. Sajid Akram, who was killed by police during the Dec. 14 attack, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram are accused of perpetrating Australia’s worst massacre since 1996. Speaking at a press conference after a Christmas Day lunch at a charitable foundation in , Albanese described a Christmas defined by a sharp contrast between extremist violence and the “best of humanity.” “This Christmas is a different one because of the anti-terror and the terrorist attack motivated by ISIS and antisemitism,” Albanese said. “But at the same time as we have seen the worst of humanity, we have seen the bravery and kindness and compassion ... from those who rushed to danger.” The proposed honors would recognize those who are nominated and recommended for bravery or meritorious awards under the existing Australian Honors and Awards system for their actions during and after the attack. Just a day after pushing through the country's toughest firearm laws, state leader Chris Minns issued a plea for national solidarity, urging Australians to support their Jewish neighbors during what he described as a fortnight of “heartbreak and pain.” “Everybody in Australia needs to wrap their arms around them and lift them up,” Minns said at the same press conference Thursday. “I want them to know that Australians have got their back. We’re in their corner and we’re going to help them get through this.” The gun reforms which passed through the New South Wales state legislature on Christmas Eve include capping individual gun ownership at four and reclassifying high-risk weapons like pump-action firearms. The legislation also tightens licensing by reducing permit terms to two years, restricting ownership to Australian citizens, and removing the review pathway for license denials. “Gun reform alone will not solve hatred or extremism, but we can’t fail to act on restricting access to weapons which could lead to further violence against our citizens, Minns said earlier in the week when introducing the proposed laws. Other new laws will ban the public display of terrorist symbols and grant police expanded powers to restrict public gatherings in specific areas following terrorist incidents. Albanese has also announced plans to tighten Australia’s already strict gun laws.",The Independent,The Independent

The true story behind NORAD’S 70-year tracking tradition,2025-12-25T04:43:27.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our The magic of Christmas Eve often brings a unique question for children and adults alike: Where is Santa? For 70 years, the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( ) has provided the answer, transforming its Cold War-era mission of monitoring skies for threats into a beloved tradition of tracking St Nick's global journey. , over 1,000 dedicated volunteers will staff the 1-877-HI- hotline from 4am to midnight Mountain Standard Time, ready to field calls from eager Santa-seekers. Some children, upon hearing Santa won't show up if they're not asleep, might drop the phone, while others simply wonder if St Nick will find them. For the first time, those outside North America can also place calls via the programme's website, offering Santa's real-time journey in nine languages, including English and Japanese. In 2024, about 380,000 calls flooded into a Christmas-decorated hangar at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, NORAD's home. While Santa poses no threat, the same sophisticated combination of radar, satellites, and jets enabling NORAD's year-round mission are deployed to track his progress. Colonel Kelly Frushour, a NORAD spokesperson, explained that tracking begins precisely at the international date line over the She added that Rudolph's distinctive, glowing nose emits a heat signature akin to a missile, which NORAD's advanced satellites readily pick up. The hotline often yields heartwarming and amusing interactions. Colonel Frushour recounted a memorable call last year from a young girl concerned that Santa was heading directly to the ""Thankfully, by the time the call was over, had moved on to another destination and the child was reassured that Santa was not trapped in space and was going to make it to her house later that evening,"" Frushour said. Michelle Martin, a NORAD staffer and Marine veteran, shared another touching story involving Henry, a man with special needs who faithfully calls every year. He once earnestly asked if the jet pilot escorting Santa through North America could leave a note for St. Nick, confirming Henry was safely in bed. Martin explained that Santa travels ""faster than starlight."" She recalled telling him, ""I don’t know that our pilot can catch up with him fast enough. He just waves and he goes."" This cherished tradition began by a delightful, yet accidental, mistake in 1955. NORAD's predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), was then on high alert for any sign of a possible nuclear attack from the then- A child mistakenly dialled the combat operations centre, asking directly to speak to Colonel Harry Shoup, unwilling to disappoint, immediately instructed his staffers to begin tracking Santa and to take calls from other children. The initial phone call is widely believed to have stemmed from either a misprint or a misdial of a number included in a Sears advertisement in a Colorado Springs newspaper, which had encouraged children to call Santa. The legend developed into the first call coming into a dedicated hotline that connected the command with a general in case of an attack. However, magazine in 2015 cast doubt on the notion of a ""flood of calls"" to a secret line, suggesting a public phone line was more probable and noting Colonel Shoup's well-known flair for public relations. In a 1999 interview with The Associated Press, Shoup vividly recalled his reaction upon realising what was happening, telling the first caller, ""Ho, ho, ho, I am Santa."" He added: ""The crew was looking at me like I had lost it."" He then quickly instructed his staff on what was happening and told them to play along, too. While the exact date of that pivotal first call remains unclear, by 23 December of that very first year, reported that CONAD was indeed tracking Santa's progress. CONAD soon evolved into the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which once operated inside the nearby Cheyenne Mountain complex. This formidable network of tunnels had been blasted out of the mountain's hard granite, specifically designed so NORAD officers could survive a nuclear attack, a stark contrast to its current festive role. From a Cold War-era misdial to a global festive phenomenon, NORAD's Santa tracking service continues to bring immense joy and enduring magic to millions worldwide, proving that even the most serious of organizations can wholeheartedly embrace the spirit of Christmas.",The Independent,The Independent

Edward, a monk-like monarch, was canonized as a saint in 1161. The monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The prerecorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. (1500 GMT), when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch. The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government. It usually has a strong religious framework, reflects current issues and sometimes draws on the monarch’s personal experiences. This year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year. The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace said that his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery. Charles recorded last year’s speech at Fitzrovia Chapel, which was once part of the now demolished Middlesex Hospital.

Read our Rain from a powerful winter storm that swept across has begun to taper off, but another storm system was on the horizon for Christmas Day with showers and possible thunderstorms. Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned of flash flooding and mudslides. Areas scorched by wildfires in January saw evacuation warnings as heavy rains and gusty winds brought mudslides and debris flows. Many flood areas were in burn scar zones, which were stripped of vegetation by fire and are less able to absorb water. San Bernardino County firefighters said they rescued people trapped in cars Wednesday when mud and debris rushed down a road leading into Wrightwood, a resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of . It was not immediately clear how many were rescued. Firefighters also went door to door to check homes, and the area was under a shelter-in-place order, officials said. An evacuation order was issued for Lytle Creek, also in the San Gabriel Mountains. Travis Guenther and his family were trapped in Lytle Creek after roaring waters washed out the only bridge in or out of their neighborhood. More than a dozen neighbors took shelter at a community center or found hotel rooms. “Everybody that left to go to work this morning is stuck,” he said. “Half the families are here, and half the families are on the other side of the creek.” Guenther said he had plenty of supplies and was coordinating with other in the community of about 280 people. Two nurses who live on his street offered to help anyone who may need medical attention. Janice Quick, president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce and a resident of the mountain town for 45 years, said a wildfire in 2024 left much of the terrain without tree coverage. The storm also stranded Dillan Brown, his wife and 14-month-old daughter at a rented cabin in Wrightwood with almost no food and only enough diapers for about another day. Roads leading off the mountain and to a grocery store became blocked by rocks and debris, Brown said. A resident learned of his situation and posted a call for help in a Facebook group. In less than an hour, neighbors showed up with more than enough supplies to ride out the storm, including bread, vegetables, milk, diapers and wipes. “I think we’re a little sad and upset that we’re not going to be home with our families,” Brown said, but the “kindness shown is definitely an overwhelming feeling.” Residents around burn scar zones from the Airport Fire in Areas along the coast including Malibu were under flood warnings until Wednesday evening, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. Several roads including a part of Interstate 5 near the Burbank Airport closed due to flooding. The storms were the result of multiple atmospheric rivers carrying massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. Heavy snow and gusts created “near white-out conditions” in parts of the Sierra Nevada and made mountain pass trave treacherous. Officials said there was a “considerable” avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, and a winter storm warning was in effect until Friday morning. declared a state of emergency in six counties to allow state assistance in storm response.

Read our asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars. The disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department’s ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women. socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein never went to trial. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail. prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial. Maxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. She filed the petition on her own, without the assistance of a lawyer. This week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities. Epstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell’s crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts."" “I’ve heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said. Bensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. She said she was never personally abused by Maxwell. The transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure. The Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information. On Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials. Some of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. Updated versions were posted over the weekend. An FBI agent’s grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004. The agent told of a woman who described meeting Maxwell and Epstein as a 14-year-old attending a Michigan summer arts camp in 1994. Flight logs showed Epstein and Maxwell went to the school sponsoring the camp because Epstein was a donor. According to the agent, whose name was redacted from the transcript, the girl had a chance encounter with Epstein and Maxwell one day. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said. Once home, the girl visited Epstein's estate with her mother for tea and the mother was impressed when Epstein said he provided scholarships, enough so that the mother said Epstein was like a “godfather,” the agent said. The agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother. The agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister and made comments like, ‘This is what grownups do.’” Eventually, the agent testified, the girl saw Maxwell topless at the pool. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said. Then, the agent said, the girl asked Epstein what he meant by that and the financier pulled her into his lap and masturbated. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room. Maxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. One of the girls would begin massaging Epstein and Maxwell would tease the girls, the agent said. “She’d grab the girl’s breasts, and she would direct the girls on what to do,” the agent said, relaying the girl’s account. Maxwell's attitude during the encounters was ”very casual; she acted like this was normal,"" the agent said. The released testimony appeared to reflect the testimony at Maxwell's 2021 trial by a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane.” At trial, Jane said Maxwell also participated in group sessions between multiple females and Epstein that usually began with Epstein or Maxwell leading them all into a bedroom or a massage room at the Palm Beach residence.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Like many retirement communities, The Terraces serves as a tranquil refuge for a nucleus of older people who no longer can travel to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures. But they can still be thrust back to their days of wanderlust and thrill-seeking whenever caretakers at the community in Los Gatos, California, schedule a date for residents — many of whom are in their 80s and 90s — to take turns donning virtual reality headsets. Within a matter of minutes, the headsets can transport them to , immerse them in the ocean depths or soar them on breathtaking hang-gliding expeditions while they sit by each other. The selection of VR programming was curated by Rendever, a company that has turned a sometimes isolating form of technology into a catalyst for better cognition and social connections in 800 retirement communities in the A group of The Terraces residents who participated in a VR session earlier this year found themselves paddling their arms alongside their chairs as they swam with a pod of dolphins while watching one of Rendever's 3D programs. “We got to go underwater and didn't even have to hold our breath!” exclaimed 81-year-old Ginny Baird following the virtual submersion. During a session featuring a virtual ride in a hot-air balloon, one resident gasped, “Oh my God!” Another shuddered, “It's hard to watch!” The Rendever technology can also be used to virtually take older adults back to the places where they grew up as children. For some, it will be the first time they've seen their hometowns in decades. A virtual trip to her childhood neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough helped sell Sue Livingstone, 84, on the merits of the VR technology even though she still is able to get out more often than many residents of The Terraces, which is located in “It isn't just about being able to see it again, it's about all the memories that it brings back,” Livingstone said. “There are a few people living here who never really leave their comfort zones. But if you could entice them to come down to try out a headset, they might find that they really enjoy it.” Adrian Marshall, The Terraces' community life director, said that once word about a VR experience spreads from one resident to another, more of the uninitiated typically become curious enough to try it out — even if it means missing out on playing Mexican Train, a dominoes-like board game that's popular in the community. “It turns into a conversation starter for them. It really does connect people,” Marshall said of Rendever's VR programming. “It helps create a human bridge that makes them realize they share certain similarities and interests. It turns the artificial world into reality.” , Massachusetts, hopes to build upon its senior living platform with a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health that will provide nearly $4.5 million to study ways to reduce social isolation among seniors living at home and their caregivers. Some studies have found VR programming presented in a limited viewing format can help older people maintain and improve cognitive functions, burnish memories and foster social connections with their families and fellow residents of care facilities. Experts say the technology may be useful as an addition to and not a replacement for other activities. “There is always a risk of too much screen time,"" Katherine “Kate” Dupuis, a neuropsychologist and professor who studies aging issues at Sheridan College in Canada, said. “But if you use it cautiously, with meaning and purpose, it can be very helpful. It can be an opportunity for the elderly to engage with someone and share a sense of wonder.” VR headsets may be an easier way for older people to interact with technology instead of fumbling around with a smartphone or another device that requires navigating buttons or other mechanisms, said Pallabi Bhowmick, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is examining the use of VR with older adults. “The stereotypes that older adults aren’t willing to try new technology needs to change because they are willing and want to adapt to technologies that are meaningful to them,” Bhowmick said. ""Besides helping them to relieve stress, be entertained and connect with other people, there is an intergenerational aspect that might help them build their relationships with younger people who find out they use VR and say, ‘Grandpa is cool!’"" Rendever CEO Kyle Rand's interest in helping his own grandmother deal with the emotional and mental challenges of aging pushed him down a path that led him to cofound the company in 2016 after studying neuroengineering at Duke University. “What really fascinates me about humans is just how much our brain depends on social connection and how much we learn from others,” Rand said. “A group of elderly residents who don't really know each other that well can come together, spend 30 minutes in a VR experience together and then find themselves sitting down to have lunch together while continuing a conversation about the experience.” It's a large enough market that another VR specialist, Dallas-based Mynd Immersive, competes against Rendever with services tailored for senior living communities. Besides helping create social connections, the VR programming from both Rendever and Mynd has been employed as a possible tool for potentially slowing down the deleterious effects of dementia. That's how another Silicon Valley retirement village, the Forum, sometimes uses the technology. Bob Rogallo, a Forum resident with dementia that has rendered him speechless, seemed to be enjoying taking a virtual hike through Glacier National Park in Montana as he nodded and smiled while celebrating his 83rd birthday with his wife of 61 years. Sallie Rogallo, who doesn't have dementia, said the experience brought back fond memories of the couple's visits to the same park during the more than 30 years they spent cruising around the U.S. in their recreational vehicle. “It made me wish I was 30 years younger so I could do it again,” she said of the virtual visit to Glacier. “This lets you get out of the same environment and either go to a new place or visit places where you have been.” In another session at the Forum, 93-year-old Almut Schultz laughed with delight while viewing a virtual classical music performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and later seemed to want to play with a puppy frolicking around in her VR headset. “That was quite a session we had there,” Schultz said with a big grin after she took off her headset and returned to reality.",The Independent,The Independent

There have also been recent reports showing shaky confidence among consumers worried about high prices. The labor market has been slowing and retail sales have weakened. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week’s 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That’s below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. said it was acquiring the California-based vaccine maker in a deal worth $2.2 billion. The French drugmaker will add Dynavax’s hepatitis B vaccines to its portfolio, as well as a shingles vaccine that is still in development. Novo Nordisk's shares rose 1.8% after the weight-loss drug company got approval from U.S. regulators for a pill version of its blockbuster drug Wegovy. However, Novo Nordisk shares are still down almost 40% this year as the company has faced increased competition for weight-loss medications, particularly from Eli Lilly.

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-holiday-film-cottage-cotswolds-b2886371.html,Think living in a Cotswolds cottage from The Holiday would be the dream? Think again…,2025-12-25T06:00:00.000Z,"o, I hear you’ve moved to the country,” people would say when in West Oxfordshire 11 years ago. “Do you have any pictures?” Gamely, I’d pull out my phone, swipe through my photos and then choose a nice, pretty, Christmas-y shot and clings to the roof. Nine times out of 10 the reaction would be the same. “Oh my god…” they’d say. “It’s just like the house from that This happened time and time again. Most often at Christmas time, almost exclusively women excitedly point out my home’s remarkable similarity to the country cottage in the Nancy Meyers romcom starring Kate Winslet, Jack Black, (I say, mainly women because most men have never actually seen any romcoms, never mind one set in Surrey that has male characters saying stuff like “I sew and I have a cow in the backyard” and features the most spectacularly unlikely “meet cute” of all time – a drunk but collegiately dishy Jude Law, who after finding a gorgeous, sun-kissed Cameron Diaz answering the door, somehow persuades this complete stranger to let him stay on what he claims is his sister’s sofa, for the night and then, almost immediately, sleeps with her.) and discovered some remarkable similarities (with the home, that is not seduction techniques). Okay, so my own honey-coloured stone cottage is in the Cotswolds, not Surrey like the one in the film. Mine is also in a small village and is semi-detached, while the house in has no party-wall neighbours and is in the middle of a field, but otherwise, it’s pretty much the same deal. Same four windows drawn on its corners like a toddler’s artwork, same gabled front door, same age-sagged, stone-tiled roof. Like “Rosehill Cottage” in the movie, you come into mine through the front door (where Cameron Diaz famously struggled with her wheelie suitcase) stepping out of the flurrying snow and straight into the sitting room. Probably dragging in brown leaves, mud, pebbles and possibly a couple of twigs as you go. That’s when you notice something that seems scientifically impossible – it is significantly colder inside than it is outside. How can this be? Built in the early 18th century as a house for a farm worker – who quite possibly kept sheep in the downstairs living room during the winter – the cottage is made of 2ft-thick Cotswold limestone walls, which are lovely to look at, but really, really cold. Ingeniously, the stone walls retain sub-zero temperatures in the winter, then somehow actually radiate and maintain similar levels of cold during the summer. Often, during a July or August heatwave, I light a roaring fire just to take the edge off the Arctic temperature while I watch the telly. Maybe even give the central heating a quick blast. An underfloor system with warming elements would be an option if only there was an “underfloor” but basic, serf and turf accommodation like this, thrown together with spit and grit and agricultural labour some 300-odd years back, was constructed without foundations. Instead, there are just stones and huge timbers piled straight on to the dirt, with next to no insulation from below. It’s a feature that became particularly evident when the house and garden flooded in 2020 – dirty water coming up, through the floor, gushing in at the base levels of the ground floor walls… and, a day or so later, I presume, exiting exactly the same way, Limey Cotswold soil has decent drainage capabilities, I noted. In most rooms, even on sunny, blue-sky mornings, the house is also dark. Windows in a cottage of this age are small and wonky and deep-set into the interior walls like a castle’s arrow slits, which means that natural light tends to dribble, rather than stream in. I’ve decided to describe this quality as “cosy”, like Diaz’s Amanda. I have also, on occasion, just like Cameron/Amanda, put myself to bed with a glass of Malbec and a woolly hat of a winter’s night, and laid there, my breath clearly visible in the cold air above my mattress, wondering what the heck I am doing in this rural, ice-box Gormenghast... and why I choose this over Malibu. In these moments of gloom and doubt (and frequent power cuts) lighting the sitting room’s inglenook fireplace, large enough to burn heretics and tree trunks on, always adds a bit of winter cheer and Christmas crackle. Would a sozzled Law have noticed in his self-confessed room-spinning state that there is not a straight line anywhere in the house? Wooden floors slope and camber like a pirate ship’s poop deck. Ceiling heights, door frames, floor pitches, all look as if they have been erected by a team of blindfolded clowns unfamiliar with spirit levels or plumb lines. The un-flat walls, plastered like a wedding cake, have the consistency of an unmade bed. This kind of eccentric, skew whiff architecture can be painful and I am still not used to the comically Lilliputian proportions of door frames and ceilings. Clearly, the house was built at a time when the average height of a British male was somewhere in Jack Black’s 5ft5 region. If my 6ft1 frame is fully upright, some doors won’t even clear the bridge of my nose. I also have to bob down like a soldier exiting a helicopter and dodging the rotors when I walk through them, and there are always four or five occasions throughout the year when I will somehow completely forget where I am, head straight for a doorway and smack my face into its crude, overhead carpentry. A couple of times, like a bird flying into a window, I have actually been knocked down flat by an unscheduled hit. Also, want to make a cup of tea or get a brandy for that unexpected caller? Come through to the kitchen, but do mind your head. I say, kitchen. Really, more of a corridor with a cooker and cupboard and a sink. For the first nine years of living here, I made do with a tiny galley kitchen and a dining table that could, at a push, seat four. The bathroom was in a small and grim, jerry-built extension next door. Bathing and cooking as neighbours. Not nice. Even worse, if I woke from my second-floor bedroom and needed a pre-dawn pee, I’d have to go down two flights of stairs and cross the house to find relief in the Arctic temperature of the lean-to loo. This kind of eccentric, skew whiff architecture can be painful, and I am still not used to the comically Lilliputian proportions of door frames and ceilings In an attempt to add a bit of Diaz’s California to the property, I’ve since added a larger, more airy kitchen, another bathroom and two more loos. (Fun fact: my home is reputed to be the last house in Oxfordshire to get indoor plumbing – a previous owner survived until the 1980s with a freshwater well for water and a bucket khazi set-up at the bottom of the garden, which is still standing.) So, with all this in mind, I reckon Law probably had Diaz at “boot room”. “Boot room” actually being one of the most searched-for hashtags on social media, in case you didn’t know. Mine may be more of a passageway with hooks but it contains some of the correctly cine-genic boot room clutter; a brace of Hunter wellies, LL Bean duck boots, sturdy , a handful of photogenically waxy impermeables from Patagonia, Carhartt and Cordings. A number of curated tote bags are also all slung laissez-faire style (ie arranged with aspirational, anally retentive care) on a series of wooden coat pegs. The utility room/cloakroom/downstairs loo is equally significant. A butler’s sink deep enough for canine bathing, a cute, curtained storage area below, a ceramic cistern that drops water in riot police torrents onto lavatorial ceramic crafted by Victorians. A bookshelf and a basket full of white Andrex. As for upstairs, a spiral of oak steps winds its creaky way up, like a goblin’s helter-skelter, to the next floor (two bedrooms, one bathroom, a study, a second open fireplace ) and then up another flight to the attic bedroom. This was most probably a 20th-century modernisation – the house was originally just two storeys with a simple lean-to stair. The second flight leads to a converted A-frame loft – a lovely bedroom for both me and the nocturnal animals that scratch away at the roof insulation and skitter along the wood beams while I sleep. Visitors under the age of 40 do love the cutesy staircase. Any one older… not so much. Firstly, it is a potential death trap. I’ve slipped down it twice (leather shoe soles and slippery socks being the culprits), once banging my coccyx with such jarring force that I actually vomited. Another time, I fell forward and hit my head on the decapitation-capable door jam at the stair’s foot. Secondly, because it is so narrow and windy, no piece of substantial furniture can be coaxed upwards via its low and constricted wooden course. When I first moved in, several chests of drawers and a lovely old double bed from Provence had to be smashed up for its vertical transportation… then painstakingly reassembled, braced and glued. A few chairs didn’t make it all and had to be given up. Getting a steel bathtub up the stairs required the Hulk-like strength of three men. Manoeuvring a king-sized mattress was akin to disposing of a Michelin Man corpse in the attic. I feel sure that Law didn’t have the same problem getting Cameron upstairs.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/high-effort-boyfriend-dating-relationships-b2886918.html,Why the ‘high-effort boyfriend’ is the next toxic dating trend,2025-12-25T06:00:00.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our f you want to save your sanity, heed my advice: It’s not the wholesome snaps of happy families wearing matching ugly jumpers or inevitable engagement announcements you need to watch out for. No, it’s the inevitable and endless parade of smug, “boy dun good” posts from women bragging about their outstanding other halves that are destined to be the real joy zapper. While this has long been a feature of the highly curated Insta-world we’ve become accustomed to, it’s worsened in recent months; a new trend, dubbed the “high-effort boyfriend” (or “high-effort fiancé”, depending on how far they’ve travelled on the commitment train), has been doing the rounds. These videos usually start thus: “Things my high-effort boyfriend does that would send a low-effort boyfriend into a coma.” A woman will be sitting in shot, often doing her make-up, while she rattles off a list of above-and-beyond things her partner does without her having to ask. Flowers feature heavily – women will ever have to – as does picking up the restaurant tab every single time they go out. The idea seems to have originated with a content creator called Keely Grace Gaffney, whose betrothed is practically perfect in every way: a modern-day Mary Poppins. He plans surprise date nights, sets up her coffee station every morning before he goes to work at 4am, and writes her daily love notes telling her she’s beautiful. He books trips away whenever she feels mildly stressed and sets up filled with her favourite products (spoiler alert: the final gift is tickets to Hawaii for a sun-drenched elopement). Somewhere around the fifth video, I started to feel the kind of queasiness usually associated with eating a dodgy prawn. Inspired by this trope (and likely the online traction it attracted), other women quickly jumped on the bandwagon, gloating about their own saintly boyfriends’ actions. “The key to a successful relationship in my opinion is being with a man who does a lot,” wrote fellow Instagrammer Alessia. “Having a high-effort partner will literally change your entire nervous system. Because you are not ‘asking for too much.’ The right man will happily show up, put in effort, and love you out loud.” On the face of it, the “high-effort” trend might appear empowering. The moral of the story is clear: women, don’t accept less than you deserve! Demand and expect more! ! It’s the natural counterpoint to the “bare minimum” relationship rhetoric that’s also garnered a lot of airtime on social media, whereby fairly standard behaviour such as messaging consistently and showing up on time for dates are dressed up as “princess treatment”. However, aside from the temptation to compare our own relationships to these elevated, romcom versions and inevitably find them lacking, the whole “high-effort” narrative has some problematic elements once you dig beneath the surface. Though some of the things listed are genuinely about emotionally showing up – organising a monthly life check-in or having a bedtime ritual where they for their day – a troubling number of the actions centre around money. “This is the bare minimum – when we go out to eat, he pays for everything,” says one blonde of her boyfriend of four years, all while aggressively curling her eyelashes. “He never expects me to pay for ,” says another while doing her foundation. “Any time I say I want a new dress or need new clothes, he’ll take me to TJ Maxx or order me stuff online or take me to the mall,” says a third, Emily. She also has his credit card on her at all times, “just in case”, a move she at least acknowledges is “controversial”. Financial dependency can erode a woman’s autonomy and create a significant power imbalance Most stomach-curdling of all, in one video by Gaffney (the OG high-effort boyfriend trendsetter), she films her partner’s response when, as a “prank”, she dares to pay for her own online clothes shopping. “You don’t spoil you, spoil you,” comes his rebuttal. “It’s my job. I get to do that.” His tone is genuinely affronted – steely edged, verging on… controlling, maybe? The message is clear: she is not permitted to spend her own money or buy things for herself. It’s not like these women don’t have jobs, by the way. They are all in gainful employment, whether it be full or part-time work, alongside their paid content creation side hustles. However much being treated might seem like the dream, giving up financial control and . Women spent thousands of years essentially being the property of men, they weren’t, in fact, legally allowed to own any property themselves or keep their own earnings in England until the late 19th century. They didn’t gain the legal right to get a credit card, open a bank account or take out a loan without a husband or male guarantor right up until 1975. Voluntarily ceding these hard-won rights doesn’t exactly scream “feminist empowerment”. “Allowing a man to give to you, show appreciation and pick up the tab is fine – as long as you always have the ability to do so yourself,” cautions , a dating and relationship coach. “Financial dependency can erode a woman’s autonomy and create a significant power imbalance, making it harder to leave an unhealthy situation. It’s crucial for both partners to to ensure the relationship remains a choice, not a necessity.” Financial disparity, which often falls down stereotypical gender lines in heterosexual relationships, can also create a sense that the relationship is conditional, warns relationship therapist . Think about it: if one person always pays, what happens if they lose their job or fall on hard times due to unforeseen financial burdens? Does that mean the relationship is jeopardised because they can no longer hold up their unspoken end of the bargain? “Gifts are always tricky,” adds Davies. “If it’s one-sided, it can make the person receiving feel indebted in a way that’s not really healthy.” Indeed, several of the women express this sentiment in their videos. “I could spend the rest of my life trying to live up to the amazing things he’s done for me and I’d never come close because he is just so amazing,” gushes Emily. Another uneasy dynamic that quickly reveals itself is that a number of the “high-effort” behaviours revolve around the women’s aesthetics. One praises the fact that her boyfriend curls her hair for her and will drive her home immediately when they’re out so she can re-do her makeup if it’s not up to scratch; another waxes lyrical about the fact that her man “keeps track of my nail appointments – so every time I’m due for a new set he will schedule the appointment, drop me there and also pay for the set.” Occasionally, gifting your partner with some self-care is one thing. Paying for maintenance “to subtly control their aesthetic for your own satisfaction” is quite another, explains Mansfield. “When a partner’s efforts are disproportionately focused on their girlfriend’s appearance, it can stray into ‘trophy’ territory.” Especially if, as in the nail example, the upkeep seems, well, mandated. “It’s pretty unhealthy, putting a woman in a subservient position in a way,” says Davies. “That could be considered boundary breaching; personal appearance and how we groom ourselves is really our responsibility, not our partner’s. Otherwise it reinforces the sense that you’ve to do this for them, rather than for yourself.” Again, it can make it feel like the relationship comes with strings attached. Being dependent on a man to constantly lead and save you is an immature form of relationship But most concerning of all is arguably the “high-effort” behaviours that reinforce the idea that women are in some way helpless. Far from feminist empowerment, it’s Disney princess syndrome by another name. Take Alessia’s boast that her partner fills her car with petrol any time she’s running low “so I genuinely haven’t been to a gas station in like a year.” It’s a common theme; another pampered girlfriend admits: “I never pump my own gas. I hope this is a universal thing for boyfriends to do.” Or a young woman called Kylie’s declaration that she “will never touch a door handle. I will not open my car door. If I even try to grab my car door, he’ll be like, ‘no, stay here, I’m going to grab it.’” (God forbid a woman alight a vehicle when she wants!) Or back to Emily, who once again acknowledges it may be “controversial” but she literally doesn’t know how to pay their bills. “It’s just how it is,” she confesses. “He does not want me worried about that.” It’s reminiscent of Nora in , Ibsen’s famous play in which the protagonist is routinely infantilised by her husband until a past indiscretion shatters their All of these actions have one common trait: they strip women of agency and create a relationship that is inherently out of kilter. This damsel in distress, knight in shining armour trope can have its place in the early stages of a heterosexual relationship, says Davies, helping a new couple form their initial bond – but at some point they need to grow out of it. “Both of them need to be able to be adults who can lead and follow,” he explains. “Being dependent on a man to constantly lead and save you is an immature form of relationship that’s kind of regressive. If a couple stays in that stage of romantic ideals for too long, they can get hugely disillusioned later down the line.” This particular set-up can also mirror the parent-child relationship, with the man cast in the “father archetype” role. That’s certainly what’s evoked when one woman reveals that her boyfriend has “never told me no,” in a manner that’s reminiscent of spoiled brat Veruca Salt in Roald Dahl’s . A second leads with the fact that her boyfriend literally surprised her with a puppy. Healthy effort is a two-way street, rooted in genuine care and a desire to make your partner happy Arguably, none of this serves the men in these relationships either. Taking on the role of sole provider ensures there’s immense pressure to constantly provide. And being held up as a checklist of actions, the paragon of the high-effort boyfriend, must surely make these men feel more like two-dimensional accessories than fully rounded individuals who are fragile and flawed and have their own needs, too. It’s not to say women shouldn’t have standards or look for – just that they should be focusing on the elements that really matter and prioritising building a relationship of equals, in which both parties are invested in making the other feel valued and supported. “Healthy effort is a two-way street, rooted in genuine care and a desire to make your partner happy, without expectation of reward,” says Mansfield. “It becomes unhealthy when it’s used to create a power imbalance, or when one person’s needs consistently overshadow the other’s, creating dependency rather than equal partnership.” Learning to make yourself vulnerable by actually asking for what you want and need is key. As is being willing to get of the time. Forget the materialistic markers, try to see the human being behind the TikTok tick-list – and refrain from a “boy dun good” social media post this Christmas if you can possibly help it.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/christmas-is-about-family-and-mine-is-trapped-in-an-iranian-prison-b2887260.html,‘Christmas is about family – and mine is trapped in an Iranian prison’,2025-12-25T06:00:00.000Z,"t doesn’t feel real that my mum isn’t here this Christmas,” says Joe Bennett, 31. “This is a time to be with your family and celebrate one another. That’s what we always do. My mum loves . I feel so, so sad for her that she won’t be here.” Dr Lindsay Foreman, a 53-year-old business coach from East Sussex, and her husband Craig, 53, a carpenter, are both detained in an Iranian on charges of espionage that Joe labels “completely bonkers”. They’ve been locked up ever since 3 January, when they were suddenly detained at the Iranian border, two months into an around-the-world motorcycle trip. “They were so excited,” says Joe, who has given up his job in tech sales to campaign full-time for his parents’ release and manage their properties in the UK and Spain. “It was the trip of a lifetime. They’re young enough to be able to endure that kind of trip, and old enough to have the luxury of being able to do it.” Both Craig and Lindsay had taken up motorcycling a few years earlier in homage to Lindsay’s brother, Ashley, who died in a motorcycle accident back in 1993. “Mum was like Bambi on ice at first,” says Joe, laughing. “She was hilarious to watch. But then she fell in love with it.” Craig and Lindsay set off from the UK in November 2024, travelling through France, Spain, and Turkey, before reaching Iran. They’d planned to continue through Pakistan, India and Asia to finish in Australia, where Lindsay had a work conference. But they never left “They had a few days in Iran where everything was great,” says Joe. “Mum was posting lots of photos, and couldn’t have been more complimentary of the people, the art, the architecture and how warm everyone was.” On the final leg of their trip to reach the Pakistani border, she warned Joe there’d be a bad signal patch, and he might not hear from them. He wasn’t worried when the messages stopped for a few days – until he noticed she’d been online on WhatsApp and was reading his messages, but not replying. “Mum wouldn’t do that. I knew something was wrong. But what actually happened to them just didn’t cross my mind as an option – you wouldn’t even think of it when they’re just two innocent people on holiday.” Joe – along with his younger brother Toby, 20, and Kieran and Chelsea, Craig’s children from a previous marriage – contacted the Foreign Office. They were quickly told it was a missing persons case, and 10 days after their parents’ radio silence, they saw Iran had released a blurred photo of two detained UK nationals. It was Craig and Lindsay. “My heart dropped,” says Joe. “It didn’t feel real and it shouldn't be real – the reality is that they’re innocent travellers. The whole thing was completely alien for months. I’d wake up feeling normal, and then within 15 seconds, my world came crashing down again. I kept thinking – what do we do? What’s the process? How do I get them home?’ The Foreign Office advised waiting and staying silent, explaining that there is a “significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention” for all British and British-Iranian nationals travelling to Iran. “We kept thinking they’d be released once they were questioned, because they were so obviously innocent,” explains Joe. “But that didn’t happen.” Joe didn’t get to speak to his mum or stepfather on the phone for seven months. “It was traumatic. My mum is the most important person to me in this world. It was the worst thing not to be able to speak to her. It was heartbreaking for me – and for her.” He still remembers their first phone call. “The floodgates opened as soon as we said hello. She broke down. But I didn’t want to waste the opportunity, so I said what I’d planned: I love you. We love you. We’re all here and fighting. Everything’s being taken care of. We’re trying to get you home as soon as possible. I wanted them to know they’re not forgotten, and they’re being fought for.” He now knows that Craig and Lindsay were initially kept apart in solitary confinement for over 30 days before being moved to separate wards in Kerman . They did have six weeks in a cell together in spring, but were later transferred to separate wards in the notorious Evin prison in Tehran, where they still remain. “It’s been horrific for them,” says Joe. “They went on hunger strike a few months ago because they were promised calls to their family and visits to each other that never happened. When they were transferred to Evin, they were put on a commercial flight and told they were being released. Then they landed and were blindfolded and handcuffed. I can’t imagine the toll that took on them. It’s psychological torture.” The lack of clarity around their situation has been an additional torture. Craig and Lindsay went to court for their sentencing in September, but still have not been told the verdict that was reached. “We were told we’d found out in 10 days, but it’s Christmas now and we still don’t know,” says Joe. “They’re being arbitrarily detained – and we don’t even know how long for.” He is desperate for the Foreign Office to do more. “You can quite clearly tell that neither of them are spies in any way. The government can make a stand for what’s right but there doesn’t seem to be a willingness to do that. It’s not the first time this has happened either.” He says the Foreign Office strongly urged him to avoid making contact with other families who have been in similar situations, like , was detained in Iran for six years. “I found that odd. But I’m rebellious, so I reached out to them, and the accounts I had were pretty damning of the Foreign Office. I want the government to change their stance and strategy because this ‘sit and wait’ isn’t working. I don’t want to wait another three years to have my parents home.” : “We are deeply concerned by reports that Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.” Joe hoped the government would bring his parents home for Christmas. He struggles to speak about how it feels for that not to have happened. “It’s like you’re grieving a loss and you just feel so sad for them,” he says. “It affects us all, but they’re both stuck in this notoriously tough prison where daily life is basic and unsanitary. It’s so hard to hear your mum, the person who’s given and shown strength and is always optimistic, now broken and crying and begging to come home.” Christmas was always an important time for his family to get together. Last year, Craig and Lindsay both flew home from Tunisia on their around-the-world trip, just to see the family for a few days at Christmas. “They’re an integral part of Christmas. Mum always wants a million photos at the table before we can eat our Christmas dinner,” says Joe, laughing. “I find it frustrating, but then I look back at all the family Christmases we have documented.” He wishes his mum were there to document this Christmas, where the whole family would have had Christmas dinner at his great-aunt’s home in Gerrards Cross. “We always have a traditional Christmas. Good food – we’re big on cheese and wine – and everyone’s in good spirits, singing songs, playing silly games and enjoying everyone’s company. We do presents, but that’s not the important part for us – it’s about being together.” This year, Joe is spending Christmas Day with his younger brother at his dad’s house. “It just feels so different. I feel guilty about having plans when Mum asks me about them.” He hopes to speak to her on the phone on Christmas Day and is grateful that in the past month, after sporadic contact, they’ve been able to speak daily. “It’s been a chance for us to reconnect, which is fantastic. And she feels less low and lonely. It’s particularly hard for Mum because Craig has a few foreign nationals in his cell, but hardly any of the women speak English.” But Joe is always aware that things can change, like last week when his mum and stepdad were promised a visit together to celebrate Craig’s birthday. At the last minute, it was cancelled. “These little things mean so much to them, and when they’re taken away, it breaks both of them. It shows them they have no power.” The toll it has taken on the entire family has been huge. Joe is desperate that this will be the last Christmas they spend apart. “You’ve got to have hope and optimism. They didn’t come home for Christmas. Maybe that was an ambitious target. But now I want them home for their 10th wedding anniversary in June.” At the same time, he is realistic and has seen what has happened to other detained foreign nationals in Iran. “Unfortunately, some of those cases have gone on for years. That is a possibility. You’ve got to be prepared for that side of things as well. But it won’t ease off my fighting. I’ll fight every day until they are home, and we are reunited as a family.”",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/snow-weather-forecast-christmas-uk-map-met-office-b2890343.html,White Christmas? Met Office reveals where snow could fall with Christmas Day weather forecast,2025-12-25T06:17:56.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our The Met Office has given its verdict on While temperatures will drop as low as -5C in parts of the country, it looks like snow will not be making an appearance on 25 December. spokesperson Oliver Claydon said a white Christmas was “highly unlikely” and that instead Christmas Day will be mostly dry and even see spells of sunshine. “It will feel colder than of late with temperatures in the mid to high single figures,” he said. “It will feel especially cold across the windier south coast in the easterly wind “Parts of eastern Scotland and northeast England will be rather cloudy at times. The far southwest of England will also turn rather cloudy for a time, with cloud perhaps thick enough for a spot of rain. It will also be windy across England and Wales, especially in southern England where there is a risk of coastal gales.” While the Met Office has cast doubt on prospects of a white Christmas for most people, there’s a small chance that a smattering of snow may fall on Dartmoor, as afternoon rain showers push into parts of Devon and Cornwall on Christmas Day. Overall, the national weather picture for the Christmas period points to cold weather but blue skies. for this time of year feel close to freezing for much of the country. By Thursday evening, temperatures could plummet to as low as 2C in Scotland, Cardiff Bute and London. Northern Scotland is expected to see the coldest temperatures overnight, dropping as low as -5C. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said: “It will turn colder from Christmas Eve, with a strong wind across much of England and Wales, so temperatures on the thermometer will be a little bit below average: around 6C or 7C as a max, generally. “And then when you add on that wind chill of an easterly wind, it will probably feel more like freezing from Christmas Eve onwards. “It’s a bit colder than average, not unusual for the time of year, but in terms of averages, it would be a bit below.” Despite the cold end to the year, 2025 could still be the UK’s hottest year on record. The mean temperature for the year so far, as of 21 December, is tracking well ahead of the previous highest year set in 2022. The mean temperature is currently expected to settle at 10.05C, compared with 2022’s already record-breaking 10.03C. If confirmed, 2025 will be only the second year in observational records where the UK’s annual mean temperature has topped 10C. The weather on Wednesday evening is set to be generally dry and cloudy, with clear spells likely in the far south and west, according to the Met Office. It is likely to be windy in the south with some fog forecasted in northern Scotland. The forecast for Thursday will be mainly dry with some sunshine across the country.

Read our Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky says he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country’s eastern industrial heartland in an updated plan to end the war with Russia – if Moscow also pulled back from the area, creating a demilitarised zone. Unveiling the latest 20-point plan thrashed out but not yet fully agreed with the US, Mr Zelensky said could become a “free economic zone”, but it was unclear how the The peace plan, which Mr Zelensky said would need to be put before a referendum, could also involve a similar arrangement around the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, which is currently The plan, presented to reporters on Christmas Eve by the Ukrainian leader, marked the latest counter-proposal to an original 28-point document that by US envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russians. Moscow has so far given no indication it will agree to withdrawal from land it has seized. The plan also came on a day when an explosion in southern Moscow killed three people, including two police officers, as fighting continued on the battlefield in the east of Ukraine. Mr Zelensky said: “This is a document referred to as a framework, a foundational document on ending the war, a political document between us, America, Europe, and the Russians. We are ready for a meeting with the United States at the leaders’ level to address sensitive issues.” “Matters such as territorial questions must be discussed at the leaders’ level,” he added. Russia has previously insisted that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory it holds in the Donbas – an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 per cent of Donetsk – the two areas that make up the Donbas. Creating the demilitarised economic zone in the Donbas would require difficult discussions on how far troops would be required to move back and where international forces would be stationed, Mr Zelensky said. However, he added, it would provide his country with “strong” security guarantees that would require its Nato partners to act in the event of a Russian assault. Asked about Mr Zelensky’s plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would decide its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US envoys in Florida over the weekend. The working US-Ukraine draft also proposes that Russian forces withdraw from the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. American negotiators have engaged in a series of talks with Ukraine and Russia separately since US president Donald Trump presented a plan to end the war last month – a proposal widely seen as favouring Moscow, which invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago. Under the plan, Ukraine would be allowed a maximum military strength of 800,000 in peacetime and there would be an $800bn fundraising project for Ukraine’s reconstruction. The city of Enerhodar, which is the closest city to the Zaporizhia power plant, would also become a demilitarised free economic zone, said Mr Zelensky. The US proposes the plant be jointly operated by Ukraine, the US and Russia. The unveiling of the updated plan came on a day of another explosion in Moscow, killing three people including two police officers. The officers were approaching a “suspicious individual” when an explosive device detonated, said investigate committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko. Two days earlier, Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, head of the operational training directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died when an explosive device detonated under his vehicle in the same area. may have been behind the attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. ’s military said its forces had pulled out of the embattled eastern town of Siversk near “The invaders were able to advance due to a significant numerical advantage and constant pressure from small assault groups in difficult weather conditions,"" But Ukraine’s military said its forces were keeping up pressure on Pokrovsk, 50 miles from Bakhmut, and would continue trying to sever logistics for Russian troops inside.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our , at its core, is a season brimming with customs that, upon reflection, can appear quite peculiar – from bringing evergreens indoors and adorning them with vibrant baubles, to the divisive presence of , these traditions often seem rather subdued when viewed against the backdrop of global celebrations. Indeed, while Britons might debate the optimal time to deck the halls or ponder swapping turkey for beef, other nations embrace far more unconventional practices. Across the world, festivities involve everything from throwing shoes and concealing cleaning equipment, to decorating trees with intricate spider webs or even live goats. Some even opt for a Christmas Day feast at These diverse traditions, spanning centuries or merely decades, are deeply woven into the fabric of celebrations worldwide, from Catalonia to Caracas, forming an intrinsic part of the festive spirit. In celebration of these Christmassy eccentricities, we’ve rounded up 12 of the most unusual customs from across the globe. In Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore, the Krampus is Father Christmas’s scary friend, a devilish creature who punishes naughty children throughout the festive period. The mythical beast, who is hairy, with hooves and large horns, is ‘celebrated’ every year on 5 December in many cities throughout , often marked with a parade in which hundreds dress up as Krampus and chase each other through the streets. There are a couple of strange Catalan traditions, one of which is the or “defecating log”. In the fortnight leading up to Christmas, a grinning creature is created out of a small log and placed on the dining room table. The log must be fed every day with fruit, nuts, and sweets, before – on Christmas Eve – it’s beaten with sticks, excreting its goodies. Another faecal-themed Catalan custom is a , a small defecating figurine, which traditionally appears in nativity scenes. In more recent years, caganers that are sold in stores and Christmas markets throughout the region have taken the form of just about any celebrity, from Donald Trump to your least favourite rival footballer. , revellers travel to early-morning church services on roller skates throughout the festive period. Roads are even closed off especially on mornings between 16 December and Christmas Eve. but that doesn’t stop a large number of people from celebrating the festival. Father Christmas, or , is said to have eyes in the back of his head to keep an eye on naughty children, while Japanese Christmas cake is usually made up of sponge, whipped cream, and strawberries. In a further spin on Christmas food, many Japanese people head to branches of KFC on or around Christmas Day, with the week leading up to 25 December reportedly being the chain’s most profitable week of the year in Japan. , a more religious Christmas is also a time for remembrance, as families set extra places at the dining table on Christmas Eve (or sometimes on Christmas morning) for deceased relatives. The practice is called and is thought to bring the family good luck, with a meal, consisting of salted cod, potato and a range of regional desserts. women use an interesting trick to predict their love lives for the coming year. Unmarried women stand with their backs to their front doors and toss shoes over their shoulders. If a shoe lands with its toe pointing towards the door, the woman may very well be planning a wedding within the next 12 months. , it’s thought that Christmas Eve coincides with the arrival of evil spirits and witches. In a bid to protect themselves, families hide all their brooms and mops before they go to bed. Ukrainian Christmas trees are traditionally decorated with a fake spider and web. The custom, which is said to bring good luck, stems from an old wives’ tale about a poor woman who could not afford to decorate her tree. She woke up on Christmas morning to find a spider had covered it in a glittering web. If you think sprouts are bad, you should try one of Greenland’s Christmas delicacies. – raw whale skin with blubber – is one. Another is , which is when an auk (a small bird) is wrapped in seal skin, buried for several months, and then eaten once decomposed. Only about 2.3 per cent of the population of are Christians, but that still works out as about 25 million people. The day is celebrated with midnight mass and present-giving, but in the absence of fir trees or pine trees, banana trees and mango trees are decorated instead. A traditional Scandinavian Christmas symbol, the Yule goat was believed to have been a spirit that would appear before the festive season to make sure that celebrations were carried out correctly. In later centuries, the goat’s role was as a gift-giver, before eventually being replaced by Father Christmas. Nowadays, small goats made out of straw are popular tree decorations throughout Scandinavia. , it’s a Christmas dinner tradition for the most senior member of the family to throw some of the pudding (usually made from milk, bread, poppy seeds and something sweet) onto the ceiling.

Here’s what the science says,2025-12-25T07:54:20.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our is tough on your knees – and even that it can cause long-term damage. But is this true? Every time your foot contacts the ground while , your body absorbs a force that equates to about two to three times your bodyweight. It’s easy to imagine this load going straight into your knees, and it sort of does. Your knees absorb three times more load during running than walking. In fact, running may help keep your knees strong and healthy – here’s what the evidence says. Your body isn’t simply a pile of bones and cartilage that gets worn down with every step. It is a living dynamic system that grows and adapts in response to the loads that are placed upon it. Your knee joint is incredibly strong and designed to move. The cartilage inside your knee is a strong, flexible connective tissue that cushions and protects the bones of your knee joint. There is good evidence to show that when someone’s load is removed – for example, during prolonged bed rest or immobilisation – their bone and cartilage begin to deteriorate. We know running temporarily reduces the thickness of knee cartilage. This returns to normal a couple of hours after the run is finished. Researchers have suggested this may be an important process that facilitates nutrients moving into the cartilage, which can help it adapt and become stronger. Hunter Bennett is a Lecturer in Exercise Science at the University of South Australia. In support of this idea, evidence shows runners tend to have thicker cartilage than non-runners – especially in their knees. Runners also tend to have better bone mineral density than non-runners. It has even been suggested that the more you run, the better protected you are against developing (although more research is needed to confirm this). All of this points to running being good for your knees’ health and longevity – even before we consider the many known benefits it has for heart and metabolic health. Unfortunately (at least to my knowledge), there is no strong evidence examining what happens when you pick up running later in life. However, other lines of research do suggest it is likely safe and effective. A 2020 study demonstrated that older adults (65 years and older) who start high-intensity jump training (known as “plyometric” training) not only see improvements in strength and function, but also find it safe and enjoyable. And considering this type of training leads to much higher joint loads than running, it gives us a good indication that starting running in later life will also be safe and effective. , your muscles and joints need time to adapt to the new load that is being placed upon them. With this in mind, it’s best to start with intervals where you walk for a short period, then jog for a short period. Then you can gradually increase your running distance over time, giving your body time to adapt. I believe this myth still persists because, despite all its health benefits, almost half of runners will get some kind of injury each year – and injuries to the knee are among the most common. However, the vast majority of these are known as “overuse” injuries, caused by issues with load management rather than running itself. This means they are caused by people running too much too quickly, without letting their bodies adapt and get stronger. comes with the risk of injury, so we will never completely eliminate the chance of getting hurt. But with respect to running, a few things can help. First, make sure to progress slowly. Large spikes in how much and how often you run can lead to injuries. So, try not to increase your mileage by more than a couple of kilometres per week. Second, make sure to eat enough to support your running. Running is an activity that burns a lot of energy. You also need to have adequate energy available to ensure you recover properly after you run. and protein to meet your energy and recovery needs might help prevent overuse injuries such as stress fractures. Some research suggests getting enough Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that running on grass means less impact than running on harder surfaces such as concrete. So, doing a couple of your weekly runs on grass when you’re first starting might be a good way to help you adjust to the load. For most of us, the health benefits of running will far outweigh the risks – especially if you take it slow, build up strength, and keep listening to your body.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our From festive sauces to brightly coloured juices, cranberries have long been part of our diets. Beyond their tart flavour and seasonal appeal, these red berries are often described as a superfood with are promoted as a convenient way to get these benefits without the sugar or sharp taste of the juice. So what does the science actually say about cranberries, and are supplements as effective as eating the fruit? Cranberries are best known for their role in helping prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The fruit contains compounds called proanthocyanidins. These compounds appear to stop bacteria such as from sticking to the lining of the urinary tract, which is one of the first steps in developing an infection. This explains why cranberry products , although they do not treat infections once bacteria have already attached and multiplied. Research supports cranberries’ preventive role in women who experience recurrent infections and in children, although results vary between studies. One study found both cranberry juice and tablets reduced rates in women, but tablets worked slightly better and were more cost-effective. Both forms reduced antibiotic use compared with placebo. Cranberries have also been investigated for their effects on heart . They are rich in antioxidants such as anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and quercetin. Antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals. Research shows that cranberry juice or extracts can improve several risk factors for heart disease. , often called good cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, and lowering LDL cholesterol in people with diabetes. LDL is sometimes described as bad cholesterol because high levels can build up in artery walls, and it becomes even more harmful when it is oxidised. Oxidised LDL is more likely to stick to artery walls and fuel inflammation, which contributes to plaque formation. Cranberries’ antioxidants may help slow this process. They may also improve flexibility in blood vessels, reduce blood pressure and lower homocysteine, an amino acid linked to inflammation at high levels. However, not all studies report the same findings, so the evidence remains mixed. Researchers are also studying cranberries for their possible role in cancer prevention. Lab and animal studies show that cranberry compounds, including ursolic acid, may slow the growth of tumour cells. Some compounds have anti-inflammatory effects, which is important because chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of cancer. A clinical trial found that cranberry juice may help reduce the risk of stomach cancer by blocking , a bacterium strongly linked to this form of cancer, from attaching to the stomach lining. Adults who drank about two glasses of cranberry juice had lower infection rates. Lab and animal studies point to other possible anti-cancer effects, and upcoming research will determine whether these laboratory findings translate to humans. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of cranberries may also support brain health. A 2022 study found that adults who consumed freeze-dried cranberry powder each day, which is equivalent to about 100 grams of fresh cranberries, showed better memory for daily tasks and improved blood flow to brain regions involved in learning. They also had reduced LDL cholesterol. High LDL can contribute to hardened arteries, which affects circulation. Cranberries may also support the immune system. Studies suggest their natural compounds can make it less likely to catch colds or flu. Cranberries are a source of vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids and iron, all of which contribute to normal immune function. Cranberry supplements are often promoted as an easier alternative to juice or fresh fruit. They deliver concentrated extracts of dried, powdered cranberries, usually standardised to contain a set amount of proanthocyanidins. This allows people to obtain active compounds without the sugars found in many commercial cranberry juices. However, whole fresh or frozen cranberries provide fibre and a wider range of nutrients that may be missing in supplements. Eating fruit also encourages healthier overall habits, while capsules can tempt people to treat them as a shortcut. Dipa Kamdar is a Senior Lecturer in Pharmacy Practice at Kingston University. and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. Read the For most people, cranberries are safe to consume in moderation. Large amounts of juice or supplements can cause stomach upset or diarrhoea. Cranberries contain oxalates, natural chemicals that may contribute to kidney stones in people who are prone to them. Sweetened cranberry juices can also undermine potential health benefits by raising sugar intake. The most important safety concern is the potential interaction between cranberries and certain medicines. Some case reports suggest cranberry juice may enhance the blood thinning effect of warfarin, which increases the risk of bleeding. Evidence is inconsistent, but people taking warfarin are usually advised to avoid large quantities of cranberry products. There may also be interactions with other drugs processed by the liver, although these effects are not well established. Cranberries, then, whether eaten whole or taken as supplements, offer real health benefits, especially in reducing the risk of recurrent urinary tract infections. They may also support , reduce inflammation and provide some protection against certain cancers, although the evidence for these effects is less clear. Supplements cannot replace a balanced diet, and whole cranberries provide additional nutrients and fibre that extracts cannot match. Some people should exercise caution, particularly those at risk of kidney stones or those taking specific medications. Cranberries are not a magic solution, but they can be a valuable addition to the table, whether in a festive sauce, a handful of fruit or an occasional supplement. Enjoy them for their flavour and colour, and consider any health benefits a welcome bonus.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our We’ve long known that a lack of sleep is bad for the heart – but scientists are now starting to understand exactly how it causes harm. In a new study from Uppsala University in , researchers found that just three nights of restricted sleep – around four hours a night – triggered changes in the blood linked to a higher risk of The researchers looked at inflammatory proteins in the blood. These are molecules the body produces when it is under stress or fighting off illness. When these proteins stay high for a long time, they can damage blood vessels and raise the risk of problems like The study involved 16 healthy young men who spent several days in a lab, where everything from their meals to their activity levels and light exposure was carefully controlled. The participants followed two routines: three nights of normal sleep (8.5 hours) and three night of sleep restriction (4.25 hours). After each sleep phase, the men completed a short, high-intensity cycling workout, and their blood was tested before and after. Researchers measured almost 90 different proteins in the blood samples. They found that caused a clear rise in inflammatory markers linked to heart disease. And while exercise usually boosts healthy proteins such as interleukin-6 and BDNF (which support brain and heart health), these responses were weaker after poor sleep. Annie Curtis is a Professor (Assoc) in the School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences (PBS) at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences. Strikingly, the changes happened even in young, healthy adults, and after only a few nights of bad sleep. That’s worrying given how common it is for adults to experience poor sleep from time to time – and around one in four people work shifts that disrupt sleep patterns. The researchers also discovered that the time of day blood was taken mattered: protein levels varied between morning and evening, and even more so when sleep was restricted. This suggests that sleep affects not only what’s in your blood, but when those changes are most visible.

Yet, this year, the amount of aid received was its lowest since the country’s establishment in 2011. The UK has slashed aid to South Sudan by more than 40 per cent, from $131m (£97m) in 2024 to $75m (£56m) in 2025, according to data tracked by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Other major donors to cut aid include the US – slashed from $708m to $283m – and Germany – from $102m to $63m – according to OCHA. “Humanitarian aid is a lifeline for people in South Sudan, and neither the system nor the people were at all ready for these cuts,” Shabnam Baloch, country director for Oxfam South Sudan, told “As I have travelled around, engaging a lot of different donors to provide more money, I have found there is a lot of donor fatigue, with many arguing that they have poured billions into the country with too few apparent results. “But even if South Sudan might look like Conditions are expected to decline even further next year as cuts from countries like the UK really bite. Humanitarian groups in South Sudan are set to enter a state of “hyperprioritisation”, says Ms Baloch, as funding for ongoing, less-acute needs is overlooked and only people with the “most extreme needs” are helped. “This year we were able to support 770,000 people, but next year we are going to be able to support less than half of that,” says Ms Baloch. “We are supporting everything from food distribution to sanitation. Nobody else is going to be able to fill the gap left by us, so people really are going to suffer.” On the question of whether international donors like the UK should be supporting South Sudan as a part of their Sudan response, Shabnam Baloch is unequivocal: the spillover into neighbouring countries should be seen as part of the overall response to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. “When donors, including and in particular the UK, talk about the Sudan crisis, they should be taking a regional approach,” she says. “These other neighbouring countries, including Chad and South Sudan, are both already in a state of crisis, and do not have capacity to deal with refugees on their own. In response to the claims made in this article, the Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “The UK will always stand with the innocent civilians of Sudan caught in the middle of this appalling conflict and humanitarian crisis, and the prime minister’s commitment to protect that support for Sudan remains unchanged. “This year alone, we have committed over £146 million, and since the conflict began, UK aid has delivered lifesaving support to over one million people, treating children with severe malnutrition, providing water and medicine, and supporting survivors of rape. “We will continue to do everything we can to end this conflict and get humanitarian relief to the millions desperately in need.” Stories from the Renk transit centre, a refugee processing centre in the Upper Nile state of northern South Sudan, help illustrate how severe the impact of aid cuts has been on the plight of refugees coming across the border from Sudan. At the start of December, an estimated 44,000 refugees and returnees were being housed in Renk, including more than 11,000 people in the transit centre itself, which is several times more than it was designed to hold. Facilities are seriously overstretched, with only one clean water tap for every 433 people – well outside the accepted humanitarian standard of 250 – and health problems are rampant. “The population is just continuing to increase day after day and everyone is just facing so many challenges, from getting enough food to eat, to accessing materials or poles to build a shelter,” Sirivanos Manjera, Oxfam’s programme manager at Renk, told The International Organisation for Migration had been unable to provide onward transportation assistance for new arrivals for the previous fortnight, said Mr Manjera, meaning that new arrivals were staying longer than the two weeks for which . Stories of theft, drug abuse, and gender-based violence are widespread. have had to completely close their operations as a result of aid cuts. Oxfam itself, which runs sanitation and water services at the Renk site, was nearly forced to withdraw last month because of a lack of funds. At the same time, the number of cleaners in the transit centre has been cut from 40 to 15, and the maintenance team has been cut from 10 to five, says Mr Manjera. With health centres lacking protective equipment and soap, aid workers are struggling to halt the spread of infection. There have been more than 1,500 cases of cholera, which broke out in October 2024, with 14 cases recorded in the first week of this month alone. Hepatitis E, which is spread through contaminated food or water, is also rampant, with 1,131 cases overall, and nine cases in the first week of December. “It is very hard for us to bring these diseases under control, given the constant influx of people,” says Mr Manjera. Things are complicated further by climatic impacts, including the threat of floods, which this year , the system of small reservoirs that Renk inhabitants rely on for their water supply during the dry season was evaporating at such a rate, due to the intense heat, that it is currently to run dry by the end of January, rather than lasting to June as normal. If that happens, NGOs will be forced to spend huge amounts trucking bottled water across to ensure there is enough water, says Mr Manjera. The desperate, life-threatening conditions are being experienced by people who have already been through extreme trauma before reaching Renk. “I watched my husband being killed in front of me and the kids. Everything after that [on the way here] – the abuse, the roads, the endless hunger – it was just dust in my eyes,” said one woman in Renk. “I learned to bargain with the cruellest men at every single checkpoint, selling my dignity piece by piece just to buy my children another mile of safety. I didn’t arrive here: I fought my way here, carrying the weight and five lives in my empty hands.” Another woman said: ""I am only 21, but I feel like I've lived a lifetime of running. First, running from the bombs, then running from the people who threw us out. I should be dreaming about my future, but instead I carry the future of four scared little faces on my back. My childhood ended the day they pushed us across the border to Renk.” The influx of refugees comes against the backdrop of conditions in South Sudan already being difficult for many. More than 80 per cent of the population lives in poverty, up from around 50 per cent at the country’s creation in 2011. The UN estimates that around half the population – six million people – are living through extreme hunger right now, and there is a real risk of pockets of the country In recent months there has been a resurgence in fighting across South Sudan. Some 445,000 people have been forced to flee their homes this year, and nearly 1,000 weapon-wounded patients have been treated in hospitals supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has added its voice to warnings that aid cuts are driving essential services to “breaking point”.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Cold and windy conditions are set to sweep across parts of Britain on Christmas Day, with forecasters largely ruling out a white Christmas. Health and weather agencies have issued alerts, warning of potential impacts on vulnerable individuals. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a yellow cold health alert for South West England, active from 6pm on Thursday until midday on 27 December. Simultaneously, the Met Office has put a yellow weather warning for strong winds in place, affecting the same region and much of Wales, lasting until 11.59pm on Christmas Day. The warning has cancelled several Christmas day events, including sea swims in the South West. The UKHSA anticipates these low temperatures will cause minor disruptions to health and social care. This includes an ""increased use of healthcare services by vulnerable people"" and a ""greater risk to life of vulnerable people."" The Met Office said east to north-easterly winds will become particularly strong and gusty during Christmas Day, with peak gusts fairly widely of 45-55mph, but 55-65mph possible along some exposed coasts and to the west of prominent hills. It added that “given the more unusual wind direction, this may lead to some disruption to transport and power supplies” and that “large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts”. Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said Thursday would see “pretty decent” conditions with mainly dry weather. He told the Press Association: “On Christmas Day there will be a bright start in the south of England and then into Wales as well as the cloud clears. “It will be cloudier further north, but there will be some cloud breaks starting to break through by lunchtime, and some good sunny spells establishing further north as well. “The other notable factor will be the wind, so with the positioning of the high pressure there is a quite strong easterly wind, particularly across the south coast of England, so it could be quite gusty there. “High pressure is now firmly in control of the weather across the UK, bringing a much more settled spell, and also cooler temperatures than we’ve had of late.” Mr Claydon said it was “highly unlikely” that the UK will see a white Christmas this year. He added: “We’ve got a very dry picture across the UK over the next few days. “The only vague possibility is there’s a little band of rain that’s skirting westwards across the through tomorrow and there’s an outside chance it could clip the South West of England. “The chances of any snow falling out of that are very low.” Mr Claydon said the highest temperatures on Christmas Day were forecast to be around 7C in and 6C in south or South East England. He added that frost and freezing temperatures are likely in western rural areas overnight on Christmas Day into Boxing Day with minus 6C possible in rural parts of Scotland and minus 4C in rural Wales.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our he image of two women emerging from the building in London on a sunny April afternoon, arms raised in ecstasy, champagne at the ready, is one of the most unforgettable pictures of 2025. ’s highest court gave its decision on the , ruling that, for the purposes of the Equality Act, it should be based on biological sex. come in and feeling “terrified”. Members of the said they felt the country had taken a “huge step backwards” in what one woman described as a move that had “put the clock back to worse than several decades ago”. Recently leaked Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) guidance suggested that trans people could be asked about whether they should be accessing single-sex services based on their physical appearance or behaviour. The guidance was dismissed as “unworkable” by MPs and charities, who warned that it could result in the “segregation, harassment and exclusion of trans and gender non-conforming people”. spoke to five trans people about the impact of the judgment on their lives since April and what they believe the next year holds for trans people in the UK. Chris Northwood, 38, a trans woman working as a software engineer and city councillor in Manchester, believes the Supreme Court judgment has opened the doors for people to see trans acceptance as “illegal”. “It feels like we’ve taken a big step backwards this year,” she said. “As a visible trans woman, I’ve certainly seen an uptick in abuse, both on the doorstep canvassing and online.” For her, the impact of the ruling became most obvious after she was hit by “terrifying” anxiety after returning from a holiday. “We landed in the UK and I had to pop to the toilet in the airport,” she said. “I worried about being challenged and all of a sudden I realised that hadn’t been weighing on me while I was away. I feel like I have to get in and out as soon as possible when using public toilets in the UK now.” Ellis, 40, who did not want to give his surname, is a trans man. The impact of the Supreme Court ruling, he said, had been “immediate and damaging”. he had gone from feeling the UK was a “relatively safe and welcoming place to live” to worrying about how “viable” it will now be to live here safely as a trans person. Since April he had noticed some of his friends stopping going out to pubs and restaurants to avoid using public bathrooms. “There is a feeling of suicidal ideation for a lot of people I know – people who haven’t felt like that before are now saying, ‘I live in a country that hates me’,” he said. “That’s genuinely the feeling.” Marlo, who did not want to share their surname, identifies as transmasculine, a term used to describe someone who was assigned female at birth but identifies with masculinity. They had already experienced being thrown out of both male and female toilets since April. “The effects of the Supreme Court ruling are real and palpable,” the 37-year-old said. “It’s depressing, it’s sad, and it’s also terrifying.” Fox Fisher, who is non-binary transmasculine – meaning they have masculine traits but do not identify as a man or woman – said they have stopped going to the gym after they experienced transphobia while using the sauna there. “There is a lot of worry,” the 45-year-old said. “That’s a consequence of the media and the government, and that has made it very, very hard for people to exist and to thrive. I think the UK government is failing its trans and non-binary citizens.” Dr Victoria McCloud was the UK’s first openly judge. She moved to Ireland last year after feeling she was no longer safe in the UK, and following the Supreme Court judgment founded the Trans Exile Network to support those looking to do the same. she had been in contact with “hundreds” of other trans people who are following suit, many of whom have particular fears over the future of healthcare provision. “They don’t want to leave their homes,” she said. “These are people who have successful careers, families. It’s very traumatic.” Chris Northwood said she and her partner had also considered leaving the UK. “We love our life here, but we have had to think: is there a limit to how bad it could get?” she said. “If it gets to a point where healthcare is so difficult to access, then it would probably make it unfeasible to live in this country.” Ellis also said he, along with many of his friends, is struggling to see a future where he feels safe in the UK. “I don’t use the phrase ‘flee’ lightly,” he said. “That is where a lot of trans people I know have got to. They do not see a safe future in this country.” Statistics suggest they are not alone. A YouGov poll in October found that 84 per cent of respondents, all of whom were trans, said the UK was “fairly unsafe” or “very unsafe” for trans people. Almost two-thirds (65 per cent) of trans adults reported verbal abuse in public spaces, while nearly one in four (24 per cent) said they had suffered physical violence. But despite the fear, those who spoke to said there were glimmers of hope as we move into 2026. Several spoke about taking inspiration from the creative talents and kindness of those within the trans community. “We’re seeing the community really come together to help others, that’s what gives me hope,” Dr Fisher said. Marlo said: “It’s great to be reminded of that complete magnetic force we have as scapegoats and vilified members of the community.” Others are hoping the ruling itself may not survive. Dr McCloud is challenging the Supreme Court decision directly, taking it to the European Court of Human Rights. She is arguing that the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear her submissions as a trans woman deprived her of her Article Six rights – the right to a fair trial. She is hopeful that the judgment will be reversed, even if not through her own challenge, but she conceded that the process could take years. In the meantime, she believes the has become more unified and coordinated since the ruling. “After a bit of a scramble, we are now organised, we are taking actual steps which are actually succeeding,” she said. “I believe that actually this year may turn out to be better than we expect.” Ellis agreed: “This year has been the terrible, terrible shock of it, but my sense is we’re more prepared. We feel a bit more unified, and we know how to take care of each other a bit more now.” A government spokesperson said: ""Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. We are clear that there are laws in place to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment. “The UK proudly upholds a robust legislative framework to protect LGBT people and we are working to advance these rights, including bringing forward legislation to ban conversion practices and strengthening protections against hate crime.""",The Independent,The Independent

We just bombed with a movie with him, he’s got that whole J-Lo thing going on now, and I have other problems with him.’” According to the screenwriter, those “problems” dated back to when Affleck was dating Spielberg’s goddaughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. Binder claims Spielberg told him they went on a family vacation together, and that: “‘My son was a little boy, he was playing in the pool, and he got out of the pool, and Ben came in fully dressed, and my son pushed Ben into the pool. And Ben got really mad at him, and he came out of the pool and picked him up and threw him back into the pool, and made my son cry.’” When Binder asked Spielberg why he was telling him that story, he said Spielberg explained: “‘I just don't like to work with him. Plus his last two movies bombed. Find somebody else. Anyone but him. He’s cold as hell.’” When Binder told Affleck’s agent that he couldn’t cast him, the actor immediately called him back. “Ben calls me up, he says, ‘Did Steven Spielberg tell you I threw his kid in the water? Is that what happened? Is that why I'm not on your movie?’ I said, ‘No, he didn't say...’ ‘Yes he did! He told you I threw his kid in the water. That's why I'm not on the movie.’” Binder says he called Spielberg back and told him he still wanted to cast Affleck in the film.

Read our A federal judge has upheld New York’s ""Green Light Law,"" dismissing a challenge from the Trump administration that sought to prevent the state from issuing driver's licenses to individuals without proof of legal residency. US District Judge Anne M. Nardacci, sitting in Albany, ruled that the Republican administration, which had contested the legislation as part of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, failed to substantiate its claims. The judge found no evidence that the state law either usurps federal authority or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government. sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. , as defendants.

Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws. The administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.” The Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers. Under the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses. The Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information. In 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports. , offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight. In the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",The Independent,The Independent

Mulch the soil with a generous layer of organic matter up to 5cm deep to enrich the ground and suppress weeds. Lay new turf while the soil is still quite moist but is warming up. Watch out for slugs, which will decimate young emerging plants. Set beer traps, or place eggshells around vulnerable leaves, or simply pick the slugs off after rainfall. Alternatively try a biological control, a nematode that attacks them which can be watered on to the soil. Deadhead daffodils and other spring-flowering bulbs before the seedheads start to form, which ensures the bulb’s energy is focused on next year’s flowers. Continue to sow vegetable seeds such as broad beans, peas and lettuce direct into prepared soil. Clean out overcrowded ponds, dividing large clumps of waterlilies. Plant up summer bedding in borders and containers and hanging baskets when all danger of frost has passed (which could be next month in cooler regions) and keep them well watered. Keep mowing and feeding your lawn once the grass is growing well and lower the mower blades slightly as the season progresses, but avoid ‘scalping’ the lawn. beans, courgettes, runner beans and sweetcorn into cells or small pots. Place them on a sunny windowsill to encourage them to germinate and they will be ready to plant out in early June. Place straw underneath strawberry plants which helps stop the fruitlets getting wet from the ground or attacked by slugs. Plant out tomatoes in the garden, watering them in well – and start feeding them regularly. Fill gaps in borders with summer bedding or ornamental vegetables such as Remove dead or damaged growth from deutzia, philadelphus and weigela which have finished flowering, cutting to a stem joint or leaf. Thin out fruit on established apples, pears and plum trees, which will prevent the weight of the fruitlets snapping the branches and will encourage the remaining fruits to grow larger. Dig up spent tulip and hyacinth bulbs and store them away in a cool, dark shed until they are ready for planting again in autumn. Regularly water and feed containers and hanging baskets. Make provision If you are going away on your summer holiday – ask family, friends and neighbours to water the garden for you. Place all pots together in a shady spot, deadhead everything, water well and hope for the best. Top up water for wildlife, filling bird baths and other containers to allow them to drink during dry spells. Prune roses which only produce a single flush of flowers each year when they have finished blooming. Propagate some of your favourite shrubs using semi-ripe cuttings. Suitable candidates include ceanothus, lavender, skimmia, escallonia and photinia. Keep tomatoes, aubergines and peppers well watered and fed with a liquid high-potash fertiliser. Collect seeds from plants which you want to propagate, including sweet peas, nigella, poppies and nasturtiums. Plant autumn-flowering bulbs including autumn crocuses, sternbergias and colchicums. If you return from holiday to a straggly heap of dried-out container bedding plants which you can’t save, ditch them and concentrate on autumn and winter planting displays. Take cuttings from pelargoniums, fuchsias and other tender perennials. Collect diseased fallen leaves from beneath roses as debris from any which have blackspot, mildew or rust could give you problems next year if you don’t remove them. Remove some leaves from tomato plants to allow the sunshine through to ripen the fruit. Lift and divide clumps of overcrowded perennials which have finished flowering and replant them, to give you smaller but more vigorous new plants. Thin aquatic plants and cover your pond with netting to stop leaves falling in. Create a new compost heap. Clearing the garden in autumn will give you plenty of old plant material to start you off. Give the lawn a boost by raking out moss and weeds and aerating it. Keep harvesting crops including courgettes, green beans, tomatoes, sweetcorn, cabbages, autumn cauliflower and onions, and work out how you’re going to preserve your gluts, whether it’s freezing, pickling or making passata. Rake up autumn leaves and create leaf mould, a good soil texture improver or can be used as a mulch. Place them in refuse bags with holes in them for ventilation and leave them out of the way for a year, by which time they will have turned into a black, crumbly mass. Pot a clump of mint or parsley to bring indoors as a windowsill herb. Dry attractive seed heads such as eryngiums and teasel to use in indoor dried decorations. Lift and store summer bulbs including cannas and gladioli. Reseed any bare patches which have developed on your lawn. Tidy up – but not too much. Leave some old stems and leaves to provide winter protection for insects and seedheads for the birds. Plant tulip bulbs. November is the best month for them, as the cooler soil helps prevent the fungal disease tulip fire. Give newly planted shrubs and trees some protection from the elements, even if it’s just a layer of horticultural fleece. Wrap containers in hessian, fleece or other insulating material to stop the plants in them from freezing. Lift dahlias and store them in a cool, dark, dry place. Check stored fruit and veg for signs of disease. Plant up some containers for winter colour, featuring plants such as skimmia, helleborus, winter-flowering heathers and Cyclamen coum. Cut foliage, berries and winter flowers to create your own Christmas wreath. Harvest Brussels sprouts, parsnips and leeks for Christmas dinner.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Legislators in Algeria voted to declare France’s colonization of the North country a crime, approving a law that calls for restitution of property taken by France during its 130-year rule, among other demands seeking to redress historical wrongs. France slammed the law as a “hostile act” threatening bilateral efforts to heal wounds of the past. The two countries retain close cultural and economic ties but have troubled diplomatic relations. In a solemn ceremony steeped in symbolism, 340 of 407 members of Algeria’s National Assembly voted late Wednesday to approve the law. The move came just a few weeks after African countries made a collective resolution for recognition and reparations for colonial-era crimes. The law covers the period from the landing of King Charles X’s army on the beaches of Sidi Ferruch west of in 1830 to July 5, 1962, the date of Algeria’s official independence. The text provides for the restitution of Algerian archives and property moved to France during the colonial period, and the transmission to Algiers of detailed maps of nuclear tests conducted in Algeria from 1960 to 1966. It also calls for the repatriation of the remains of some Algerian resistance fighters taken to France. The law stipulates prison sentences for any action by an Algerian celebrating French colonialism, for attacks on symbols of the Algerian resistance, and “remarks with colonial connotations.” France is unlikely to heed the demands in the law. The law is “a manifestly hostile initiative,” the French Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office said in a statement to The Associated Press. It noted efforts under French President to address colonial-era grievances, and added: “We continue to work toward the renewal of dialogue,” notably about security and migration issues. Macron, in 2017, described elements of France’s history in Algeria as a crime against humanity, but stopped short of an official apology. Meanwhile, the resurgent far right in France celebrates colonialists. The economic cost of colonialism in Africa is believed to be staggering. Algeria suffered some of the most brutal forms of French colonial rule. Nearly a million European settlers held greater political, economic and social privileges, even though Algeria was legally part of France and its men were conscripted in World War II. Hundreds of thousands died in Algeria’s revolution, during which French forces tortured detainees, disappeared suspects and devastated villages as part of a counterinsurgency strategy to maintain their grip on power. Huge Algerian flags adorned the lower house of parliament as speaker Mohamed Boughali delivered his opening address Wednesday. “Today, December 24, 2025, is a historic day, to be written in letters of gold in the national narrative,” he began, before being interrupted by lawmakers intoning an excerpt from the Algerian national anthem: “O France, the hour of reckoning has arrived … we have sworn to revive Algeria, bear witness! Bear witness!” The speaker called the law, ″a political message and an explicit moral stance.″ Government officials, professors, and former members of parliament who championed the bill were all invited to the ceremony. As the speaker declared the law adopted, shouts of “Allahu Akbar!” and “Tahya Al Djazair!” (Long live Algeria!) rose from the floor. “This is a special day for me, full of emotion and pride. Today marks the culmination of a long struggle that we began in 2001 with fellow members of parliament, for the memory and honor of all those who fought against French colonization,” Mohamed Arezki Ferrad, a former lawmaker who initiated the bill, told the AP. The law, which contains five chapters and 27 articles, declares that there is no statute of limitation on colonial-era crimes.",The Independent,The Independent

The church said that the attack occurred around 3 a.m. Monday and also damaged part of the Nativity scene. The church quickly cleaned the burned tree and erected a new Christmas tree a day later, in time for Christmas Mass. The church held a special ceremony with the presence of local Muslim and Christian leaders and politicians. Rev.

The tiny Christian community in the West Bank is facing growing threats of extremism from multiple sides, including both settlers and Palestinian extremists, leading them to leave the region in droves. Christians account for between 1%-2% of the West Bank’s roughly 3 million residents, the vast majority of them Muslim. Across the wider Middle East, the Christian population has steadily declined as people have fled conflict and attacks.

It’s believed the killing happened between 9 p.m. on Friday, December 7, and 5 a.m. the following morning. Badger’s son, Alan, discovered his father’s body early that day. Police said a black 46-inch Sony Bravia television had been stolen. So had a light-to-medium dark gray John D. Brush and Company model safe, measuring 23½ inches tall, 17 inches deep, and 17 inches wide. Despite hundreds of tips and a $30,000 reward offered for information leading to an arrest, the case stalled. Years later, a locked safe matching the description was discovered inside an abandoned farm silo several miles from Badger’s home. Its serial numbers had been partially damaged, raising immediate hope. But when the property owners forced it open, documents inside tied it to previous landowners – not to Lowell Badger. Investigators still believe it may hold crucial evidence or confirm what the killers were searching for that night. In 2023, Indiana State Police renewed their focus on the case, assigning full-time detectives to reexamine evidence and re-interview witnesses. What followed was multiple statements from more than a dozen unnamed individuals that revealed new leads. According to court documents, during a party on the evening of December 7, 2012, a witness heard William Ray Grimes, Richard Taft, and another individual allegedly saying that they were going to break into a house looking for money. Later that night, witnesses said the men returned with a flat-screen television in the bed of a truck. On the morning of December 8, a person received a phone call from Grimes asking for a ride to town for Taft. The witness found Taft hiding behind a building in tall grass. Taft said he had been left behind and needed to get out of the area quickly. When the car approached a law enforcement vehicle, Taft told the driver to turn away from the lights. Days later, after seeing news coverage of Badger’s murder, the witness recognized the location where they had picked Taft up. According to multiple witnesses, Taft later described his role in the crime. One person told police Taft admitted to participating in the “hitting” and robbing of an old man, saying someone else was too afraid to shoot, so he took the gun and shot Badger himself. Taft allegedly said the safe was thrown into a creek behind a relative’s house. Another witness recalled Taft crying and screaming during a car ride, talking about an old man he “did not want to hurt like the old man had been hurt.” At the time, the witness did not yet know about Badger’s murder. Over the years, Taft reportedly told different versions of the story – sometimes claiming another person shot Badger, sometimes saying Grimes was the killer, and sometimes admitting his own involvement. Investigators noted these inconsistencies in a probable cause affidavit. In April 2024, a grand jury indicted William Ray Grimes on charges of murder, burglary, and conspiracy to commit burglary. Already incarcerated on unrelated charges, Grimes was formally served with the warrant at an Indiana Department of Correction facility. Richard D. Taft, 39, was charged with murder and two counts of burglary resulting in bodily injury. He was arrested at the Michigan City Correctional Facility, where he is serving a sentence for a separate conviction. His projected release date is 2031. A probable cause affidavit cited interviews with 58 witnesses, several of whom described Taft as “emotional” and “crying” in the months after Badger’s death. A Sullivan County jury ultimately found Grimes guilty of murder, burglary, and conspiracy to commit burglary, adding a firearm enhancement to the charges. During the trial, prosecutors relied heavily on witness testimony. Forensic experts testified that Badger died from a .22 caliber gunshot wound to the temple, with bloodstain analysis suggesting he may have been standing when he was shot. Taft testified for the prosecution, admitting his involvement in the burglary and claiming he saw Grimes shoot Badger at point-blank range. He denied testifying in exchange for a reduced sentence. The defense challenged Taft’s credibility, highlighting his past denials and criminal history, and argued there was no physical evidence tying Grimes directly to the scene. In May, the jury returned a guilty verdict. In June, Grimes was sentenced to 120 years in prison – 70 years for murder and 50 years for conspiracy. The judge cited the “heinous nature” of the crime in imposing the maximum sentence. But Grimes maintained his innocence and said he would appeal. After the sentencing, Lowell Badger’s son, Alan, spoke publicly about the long road to justice. “We are blessed to have a community that supports us, we have been blessed to have a family that supports us, we have been blessed to have a church that supports us,” he said. “There are a lot of days where you think you take a step forward, and the next day you take two steps back. It’s been a long journey.” Lowell Badger was widely known and deeply loved in his community. A retired farmer, he had raised three children with his wife, Nellie, who died in 2008. He devoted much of his retirement to Kingsley Memorial United Methodist Church, where he had been an active member since 1960. He also served for decades with the Sullivan County Credit Union, the Island Levee Conservancy District, and as District 7 Director of Farm Bureau. A neighbor described him as “the kindest man I’ve ever met.”",The Independent,The Independent

He recounted being stopped at checkpoints and told by these groups that he was unable to visit Palestinian families in the occupied West Bank During his Christmas Day sermon at York Minster, he said: “We have become – and really, I can think of no other way of putting it – we have become fearful of each other, and especially fearful of strangers, or just people who aren’t quite like us. “We don’t seem to be able to see ourselves in them, and therefore we spurn our common humanity.” He described how YMCA charity representatives in Bethlehem, who work with “persecuted Palestinian communities” in the West Bank, gave him an olive wood nativity scene carving. The piece showed a “large grey wall” blocking the three kings from getting to the stable to see Mary, Joseph and Jesus. The Church of England archbishop added: “It was sobering for me to see this wall for real on my visit to the Holy Land, and we were stopped at various checkpoints and intimidated by Israeli militias who told us that we couldn’t visit Palestinian families in the occupied West Bank. “But this Christmas morning here in York, as well as thinking about the walls that divide and separate the Holy Land, I’m also thinking of all the walls and barriers we erect across the whole of the world and, perhaps most alarming, the ones we build around ourselves, the ones we construct in our hearts and minds, and of how our fearful shielding of ourselves from strangers – the strangers we encounter in the homeless on our streets, refugees seeking asylum, young people starved of opportunity and growing up without hope for the future – means that we are in danger of failing to welcome Christ when he comes.”",The Independent,The Independent

A remarkable 1,152 individuals took part, easily surpassing last year’s record of 790. The estate buzzed with festive music emanating from loudspeakers, while enthusiastic crowds cheered on the participants. Race director Marianne Hood noted that Stormont is fast becoming the go-to destination on Christmas morning. ""I think it’s now becoming a tradition,"" she said. ""So many people, I think that they’re hearing about it, and then they’re wanting to come this year to see what it was like because they’ve heard of people from last year.""

Read our at home presents a unique culinary Everest, even for the most seasoned cooks. Unlike the specialised roles within a professional restaurant kitchen, the home chef is tasked with single-handedly orchestrating an entire multi-course meal. This demanding scenario underscores the paramount importance of precise timing, a point highlighted by acclaimed ""When you’re cooking at home, you have to do everything,"" Stein observes, ""therefore your timing has to be really good. In a restaurant kitchen you’re doing four or five things really, and nothing else, also they’re all part of the same course."" , has recently been released, aims to demystify this complex process. He offers practical strategies to manage extensive preparations ""to do it all painlessly."" His core advice centres on the power of forward planning: ""Don’t leave everything until Christmas morning, there are many, many things that you think need to be done at the last minute – they really don’t."" His new collection of recipes, designed to be prepared over the fortnight leading up to Christmas, spans from elegant canapés – such as mini brioche toasts with whipped feta, fresh figs, and pickled walnuts – to sophisticated starters like Jerusalem artichoke soup with crispy bacon. For show-stopping desserts, he suggests a semifreddo cheesecake with clementine and Campari syrup, or a classic Black Forest trifle. And, in true Stein fashion, seafood features prominently. Here, the celebrated chef shares his essential tips for ensuring the main Christmas meal is a resounding success. For Stein, the traditional turkey or goose remains paramount. ""I think Christmas is special in that it is about celebrating the same things or every year,"" he explains. ""I really quite like the repetitiveness because it only comes around once a year. So turkey or goose with all the trimmings is what it’s all about. I would feel like I’d sort of let down if it was just roast beef, even if it was absolutely wonderful roast beef."" While his book does offer alternatives like venison bacon and prune shortcrust pie or glazed bone-in Christmas ham, the bird holds a special place. The most common error with turkey, he notes, is ""overcooking it. It’s just a big chicken really. The biggest mistake is getting too nervous and overcooking it. People worry they’re going to get food poisoning if it’s undercooked, which is very, very unlikely."" His solution is simple: ""Buy yourself a [oven] temperature probe to make sure you don’t overcook it. I think the safe temperature for a turkey is something like 70 degrees. Once you start going over that, you get this problem with dry meat."" He also suggests wrapping the bird in buttered muslin, but stresses that the ultimate goal is ""really about not cooking it too long."" Stein’s advice for gravy often surprises people: ""Don’t make your gravy at the last minute."" He advocates for preparing a rich stock the day before using giblets from a free-range turkey or goose, supplemented with chicken stock. ""I start with a little bit of duck fat and put a bit of flour in (I don’t like a lot of flour in my gravy). I cook that out, then make the gravy, because then I can absolutely make sure it’s quite intensely flavoured."" On Christmas Day, with the gravy already made, he simply deglazes the roasting tray with some of the prepared gravy to capture all the rich pan juices. For Stein, roast potatoes are as crucial as the gravy. The secret lies in the parboiling: ""I go for seven minutes in lightly salted water,"" he advises. ""Seven minutes is enough if you’re using Maris Piper or King Edward, to make them a bit crumbly on the outside."" After draining, he shakes them vigorously in the pan or colander to roughen the edges, then sprinkles them with polenta or semolina for extra crispiness. He often parboils them the day before, leaving them out rather than refrigerating, and always uses goose or duck fat for cooking. ""But the secret, I think, is having a fairly firm potato and not in any way elastic. It’s got to have a sort of brittleness but not too brittle."" Stein prefers to cook stuffing separately rather than inside the bird. For goose, he opts for a sage and onion stuffing, explaining, ""because goose is so rich, you want something quite bland to serve with it."" With turkey, which has a milder flavour, he suggests a chestnut or sausage meat stuffing, as ""it can take a bit more flavour in the stuffing."" Perhaps surprisingly, Stein admits to cutting corners with sprouts: ""I have cut corners by buying pre-peeled from a supermarket."" He even conducted a blind taste test one year and found no discernible difference. Eschewing the classic chestnut and bacon combination, he prefers sprouts served simply. ""It’s not a sort of purity,"" he clarifies. ""It’s the balance of the whole meal. If you put stuff with every veg, they’re just fighting against each other."" , published in hardback by BBC Books, is available now, priced £28. Photography by",The Independent,The Independent

Saudi Arabia has backed other fighters within Yemen, including the National Shield Forces, in the war against the Iranian-backed Houthis the kingdom launched in 2015. The separatists' actions have ""resulted in an unjustified escalation that harmed the interests of all segments of Yemeni people, as well as the southern cause and the coalition’s efforts,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry warned. It added: “The kingdom stresses the importance of cooperation among all Yemeni factions and components to exercise restraint and avoid any measures that could destabilize security and stability, which may result in undesirable consequences.” The Council has moved into Yemen's governorates of Hadramout and Mahra. The Saudi statement said meditation efforts were aimed at having the Council's forces return to “their previous positions outside of the two governorates and hand over the camps in those areas” to the National Shield Forces. “These efforts remain in progress to restore the situation to its previous statement,” the ministry added. The local Hadramout governorate's authority said it supported the Saudi announcement and welcomed the arrival of a joint Saudi-UAE delegation to Hadramout. It called for the Emirati-backed separatists to withdraw back to positions outside the governorates. Those aligned with the Council have increasingly flown the flag of the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967 to 1990. There were calls for demonstrations Thursday in Aden to support political forces wanting South Yemen to again secede from Yemen, but it wasn't immediately clear if they would go ahead given Saudi Arabia's announcement. Aden has been the seat of power in Yemen for forces aligned against the Houthis. The confrontation also has put pressure on the relationship between neighboring Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC oil cartel but also have vied for influence and international business in recent years. The Council's moves in Yemen follow an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation on the where the kingdom and the Emirates back opposing forces in an ongoing war. It's the latest chaos to grip war-torn Yemen The Houthis seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile. Tehran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a United Nations arms embargo. A Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The Houthis launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping. While traffic has inched up recently in the lull in attacks, many shippers continue to go around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Further chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States. The U.S. launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that President halted just before his trip to the Mideast. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using America’s B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis. The Houthis meanwhile announced plans for a funeral Thursday for several of its fighters, including Maj. Gen. Zakaria Abdullah Yahya Hajar, whom analysts identified as the group's drone and missile chief. U.S. forces reportedly targeted Hajar, who allegedly received training from the expeditionary Quds Force of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, in a strike in March in Sanaa. The Houthis provided no information on how or when he died in the funeral announcement.

Most of those laws passed by Congress have been so-called “disapproval” resolutions that rolled back regulations enacted during the previous administration but did not enact new policies. , was brought to the House floor by a rarely-used discharge petition process over House Speaker Mike Johnson’s objections, and eventually signed into law by Trump only after the Senate passed it by unanimous consent. Some bills have honored certain groups, such as a pair of laws enacted earlier this month that raised the pension awarded to Medal of Honor recipients and authorized the U.S. Mint to award Congressional Gold Medals to the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic ice hockey team. Others were must-pass bills such as the annual or so-called “continuing resolutions” to fund the government at last year’s spending levels because Congress hasn’t passed regular spending bills this year. And a few were stand-alone bills representing priorities of Trump or his allies, such as the Laken Riley Act (requiring non-citizens who are charged with certain crimes to be held without bond) or the Take It Down Act (requiring online platforms to remove nonconsensual intimate images) supported by First Lady Melania Trump. Data maintained by C-SPAN and Purdue University showed the House casting just 362 roll-call votes this year — the lowest number of votes in a first year of a Congress this century, and around half of their output from 2017, Trump’s first year in office during his first term. The Senate was slightly more active, with 659 roll-call votes this year, more than any Senate during an odd-numbered year this century. But the vast majority of those were votes on nominees to federal agencies and the judiciary. With days to go until Americans are hit by sky-high health insurance premiums because Congress did not extend Covid-era subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplaces, Congress has still not offered up a solution to that looming problem. Ohio Republican David Joyce lamented the failure to address that problem when asked to evaluate the 119th Congress’ record by “We dropped the ball miserably by not doing something on health care all year long, knowing that the subsidy issue was going to be here at the end of the year,” Joyce said. “We didn’t do a damn thing about it.” Joyce noted that Congress managed to pass Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending package which contained many Trump-endorsed priorities but was limited by Senate rules governing the party-line process that allowed the upper chamber to consider the bill without a 60-vote filibuster in the way. That followed a pattern first started in 2001, when the GOP-led Congress under then-president George W. Bush passed a massive tax cut bill that blew up a budget surplus left by the outgoing Clinton administration. “I guess we got the big, beautiful bill done,” he said. “Other than that, I really can’t point to much that we got accomplished.”",The Independent,The Independent

Nursing was left off the list of professional degrees deemed eligible to apply for the highest debt limits which was set at $200,000. Those pursuing graduate degrees in nursing are limited to borrowing a maximum of $100,000, which no longer covers the full cost of some advanced programs in the field. The decision “threatened the very foundation of patient care” by limiting student nurses’ GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York is supporting legislation with four other Republicans to add nursing to the Education Department’s list of “professional” degrees, along with occupational therapy, social work, audiology and physician assistant, which were also excluded, There is “a very easy way to solve this,” Lawler told the outlet, whose allies include fellow Republican representatives, Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Brian Fitzpatrick and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania. They were among 140 lawmakers to sign a on December 12 urging the department to reconsider. “At a time when our nation is facing a health care shortage, especially in primary care, now is not the time to cut off the student pipeline to these programs,” the letter said. Lawler said adding nursing to the list of professional degrees eligible for the higher funding was “vital.” “I don’t think that this is that controversial,” the lawmaker told Kiggans, a nurse practitioner and vice co-chair on the House nursing caucus, said she spoke to Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent in November. “I just really drove the point home that this is not inclusive of nurses,” she said of the call. “It’s disrespectful to nurses,” Kiggans added. “And we have a nursing shortage.” If the changes move forward with the cap for nursing students, the new measures are due to be implemented starting July 1, 2026. Following backlash in late November to the decision, the Education Department published a “myth vs fact” news release and claimed “95 percent of nursing students borrow below the annual loan limit and therefore are not affected by the new caps.” It also said the “professional degree” is an internal definition “used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs.” “Congress chose not to change the existing definition of professional student, but they can amend the law at any time, and the agency will issue responsive regulations,” Ellen Keast, the Education Department’s press secretary for higher education, said in a statement. “At a time when healthcare in our country faces a historic nurse shortage and rising demands, limiting nurses’ access to funding for graduate education threatens the very foundation of patient care,"" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association. “Excluding nursing from the definition of professional degree programs disregards decades of progress toward parity across the health professions and contradicts the Department’s own acknowledgment that professional programs are those leading to licensure and direct practice,” the American Association of Colleges of Nursing said in a statement. Mary Turner, president of National Nurses United, previously told that the Trump administration’s priorities were “at odds with the needs of nurses and patients.” “If the Trump administration truly wanted to support nurses, it would be working to improve working conditions, expanding education opportunities, and ensuring patients can get health care,” Turner said. “Instead, this administration is stripping nurses of their union rights, making education harder to access, and cutting health care for those who need it most.”",The Independent,The Independent

Together, we celebrated the Jubilee theme, ‘Pilgrims of Hope’. “Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it has particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas. It is about journeying forward, into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons. “We did this during the summer, as we celebrated the 80th anniversaries of VE and VJ Day. “The end of the Second World War is now remembered by fewer and fewer of us, as the years pass. But the courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and women, and the way communities came together in the face of such great challenge, carry a timeless message for us all. “These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth. As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight. “For instance, it is impossible not to be deeply moved by the ages of the fallen – as the gravestones in our war cemeteries remind us. The young people who fought and helped save us from defeat in both world wars were often only 18, 19 or 20 years of age. “Journeying is a constant theme of the Christmas story. The holy family made a journey to Bethlehem and arrived homeless without proper shelter. “The wise men made a pilgrimage from the east to worship at the cradle of Christ; and the shepherds journeyed from field to town in search of Jesus, the saviour of the world. In each case, they journeyed with others, and relied on the companionship and kindness of others. Through physical and mental challenge, they found an inner strength. “To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope: of resilience in the face of adversity; peace through forgiveness; simply getting to know our neighbours and, by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships. “Indeed, as our world seems to spin ever faster, our journeying may pause, to quieten our minds – in TS Eliot’s words ‘At the still point of the turning world’ – and allow our souls to renew.“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong. “It seems to me that we need to cherish the values of compassion and reconciliation; the way our Lord lived and died. “This year, I have heard so many examples of this, both here and abroad. These stories of the triumph of courage over adversity give me hope, from our venerable military veterans to selfless humanitarian workers in this century’s most dangerous conflict zones; to the ways in which individuals and communities display spontaneous bravery, instinctively placing themselves in harm’s way to defend others. “As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common; a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life. If we can find time in our journey through life to think on these virtues we can all make the future more hopeful. “Of course, the greatest pilgrimage of all is the journey we celebrate today – the story of The One who ‘came down to Earth from Heaven’, ‘whose shelter was a stable’ and who shared his life with ‘the poor and lowly’. “It was a pilgrimage with a purpose, heralded by angels, that there should be peace on Earth. That prayer for peace and reconciliation – for ‘doing to others as we would have them do to us’ – which rang out over the fields near Bethlehem more than two thousand years ago, still reverberates from there and around the world today. “It is a prayer for our times, and our communities too, as we journey through our lives. So, with these words and my whole heart, I wish you all a most peaceful and very happy Christmas.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our online campaigner hit by US sanctions has launched a legal battle against deportation by Donald Trump’s administration. Former Labour adviser Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), said he was “proud to call the United States my home”. Mr Ahmed was one of a group of people involved in campaigns to tackle disinformation and hate speech online who were hit with visa sanctions, with US secretary of state accusing them of leading “efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose”. Senior State Department figures have accused the group of seeking to censor online platforms such as Elon Musk’s X. Mr Ahmed, who lives in Washington DC, said: “My life’s work is to protect children from the dangers of unregulated social media and AI and fight the spread of antisemitism online. “That mission has pitted me against big tech executives – and Elon Musk in particular – multiple times. “I am proud to call the United States my home. My wife and daughter are American, and instead of spending Christmas with them, I am fighting to prevent my unlawful deportation from my home country.” Sarah Rogers, the US undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, said Mr Ahmed was sanctioned because he was a “key collaborator” with Joe Biden’s administration’s efforts to “weaponise the government” against US citizens. She said the CCDH had called for social media sites to “de-platform” anti-vaccine campaigners – including the now health secretary Robert F Kennedy – and had backed measures, including the UK’s Online Safety Act, “to expand censorship” around the world. said her client “has dedicated his life to protecting people (including children) from the violence and misinformation flooding social media”. She said: “He has been particularly prescient in warning against the dangerous spread of antisemitism. That mission means he sometimes faces off against powerful tech billionaires who don’t like criticism, like Elon Musk. “The State Department’s actions here are unjustified and blatantly unconstitutional. “Imran is proud to call the United States his home. Instead of spending Christmas with his wife and child, he has been forced to spend the holiday fighting to prevent his unlawful deportation. It is hard to think of anything more un-American than that.” Mr Ahmed filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York against Mr Rubio, Ms Rogers, US attorney general and secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem to prevent their attempt to arrest and expel him from the country. A district judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing the arrest or detention of Mr Ahmed with a further hearing in the case listed for December 29. Oxford graduate Clare Melford, who leads the UK-based Global Disinformation Index (GDI), was also barred from entering the US under the sanctions. A GDI spokesperson said the visa sanctions on Ms Melford were “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.” The Trump administration has signalled the sanctions could be followed by further action, potentially targeting serving politicians or officials. Other Europeans hit with travel bans were the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton, and Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of German organisation HateAid. Mr Ahmed has links to senior Labour figures, having worked as an adviser to now-Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn during his time as shadow foreign secretary. Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, was listed as a director at the CCDH before resigning in April 2020, according to Companies House records. , Labour chairwoman of the Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, said: “Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content. He was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability. “Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.” The action to bar them from the US is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law against its targets. Mr Rubio said: “For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organised efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. “The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.” Ms Rogers hinted the action could spread wider: “None of those sanctioned is a current UK or EU official, however, we know that foreign government officials are actively targeting the United States. “This week, the UK’s Liberal Democrats claimed President Trump’s national security strategy amounts to foreign interference by a hostile foreign state because it correctly identifies mass migration and decaying national sovereignty as existential European security concerns.” The Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesman, Calum Miller, said: “These sanctions are an attack on free speech and amount to bullying tactics. The Government must stand up for its citizens, not stay silent.” A UK Government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our UK is “utterly doomed” and won’t help the party keep power at the next election, with union leaders cautioning the since the general election, with the rise of ’s Reform UK partly coming as a result of the head of one of Britain’s largest teaching unions, warned that the prime minister “can never out-Farage Farage”, accusing Sir Keir of “acquiescing to an agenda set by a far-right and populist agenda”. , suggested that the prime minister should stick to his “core principles and not sell them out in order to get votes”, expressing concern that tough immigration policies would pose problems for the NHS, given its high reliance on migrant workers. He accused Sir Keir of “chasing right-wing votes in a way that is causing division in society” and making Britain feel “more anxious and divided”. It came as a leading pollster suggested that the PM is facing the same predicament as Rishi Sunak faced before his brutal general election defeat, with a split voting coalition, and warned that solely relying on tough rhetoric won’t work. Keiran Pedley, a pollster at Ipsos, said it would be “naive” to think that Labour shouldn’t address migration, given it’s the number one issue among voters, but he warned that there are also “large numbers of more progressive left-leaning voters that don’t like that”. The leader of Unite, a major Labour-backing union, warned in July that it could cut ties with the party, potentially leaving Labour without a major donor it has previously relied upon. The government has pursued an increasingly right-wing agenda as Reform UK surges ahead in the polls, launching a major crackdown on immigration and ramping up its rhetoric. In May, the prime minister was criticised for using language which mimicked that of Enoch Powell, when he said the UK risks becoming “an island of strangers” in a controversial immigration speech. including making refugee status temporary, so that people are returned to their homeland once it becomes safe. Ministers are also considering requiring some asylum seekers to contribute to the cost of supporting themselves, and see off the rise of the far right. Sir Keir’s political opponents, the Conservatives and Reform UK, have both said they would leave the ECHR if in power. The prime minister’s approach to immigration since taking office marks an extraordinary turnaround in the last five years from when he was Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow minister promoting open borders, and from three years ago when he claimed that those raising immigration as an issue were “racist”. Asked whether he thinks a shift to the right will win over voters, Mr Wrack told it is an “utterly doomed and frankly ridiculous strategy”. He said: “Keir Starmer can never out-Farage, Farage. No matter how far Keir Starmer or Shabana Mahmood go on immigration, Nigel Farage will seize the opportunity and will go further.” The union boss accused the Labour government of “legitimising Farage’s claims that we are facing existential threats from people who are fleeing wars around the world, and instead of standing up for decency, they are acquiescing to a far-right and populist agenda. “They can’t win that battle. They just can’t win it.” And Dr Dolphin said: “I think Labour’s strategy is probably up to him to plan out. I would say that you’ve got to make sure that as a party, in the same way as a trade union, you need to stick to your core principles and not sell them out in order to get votes.” He added: “Some of the policies that have been put forward, both by the government and by opposition, are chasing right-wing votes in a way that is causing division in society. “It is leading to people who live here, people who were born here, even, feeling unwelcome in their own country. That leads to society feeling more anxious and divided, and that is no good for us as a country, as a society.” He added: “We should be looking to be closer as a society, not to divide ourselves internally and to exclude people. Some of the policies that are being pursued are going to worsen that situation, and they’re not, ultimately, going to be to the benefit of this country.” Dr Dolphin warned that the immigration policies Reform UK has proposed would make it more difficult for the NHS to function. “We are very dependent in the NHS on a workforce that comes from overseas, both for doctors and for other staff in the NHS and social care as well, for that matter. “And the policies that Reform is proposing are going to make it much more difficult for that workforce to come to the UK, and we aren’t yet able to be self-sufficient to produce enough doctors of our own and nurses and of our own to fill that gap”, he said. Sir Keir is facing a “real strategic challenge”, arguing that Labour has to find a way of addressing migration while “not alienating younger, more progressive voters who are more than happy to shop around.” The Ipsos pollster said that the government needs to demonstrate a “sustained period” of their policies being successful, rather than relying on rhetoric alone, if it wants polling to bounce back up. “The pace of change isn’t fast enough at the moment to persuade voters”, he warned.",The Independent,The Independent

Now, experts are warning that parents should keep an eye on their children’s flu symptoms with Dr Juanita Mora, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association, telling that the virus is hitting both children and adults “hard.” “This new strain has symptoms of really high fevers, it has a really bad cough that won't go away, very phlegmy, and also vomiting and diarrhea and lots of joint aches as well as muscle aches,” she said. She added that patients have been reporting fevers as high as 104 and 105 degrees.

Read our in the District of Columbia is set to hold a public hearing on President ’s massive White House ballroom building project on January 8, months after the president ordered the historic White House East Wing demolished to make way for the planned $400 million event space. The National Capital Planning Commission last week said it would host White House officials who would present information about what it called the “East Wing Modernization Project” in a public notice announcing the meeting, which will start what could be a months-long review of the project by the commission. “This is an opportunity for the project applicant to present the project and for Commissioners to ask questions and provide general observations prior to formal review which we anticipate this spring,” the document said. Last week, a federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to provide the commission and another federal committee, the Commission of Fine Arts, with plans for the project by the end of this month after the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit seeking an emergency order to had failed to present its plans to both bodies for legally-mandated reviews before Trump ordered the East Wing knocked down to make way for the planned ballroom. Judge Richard Leon, who was nominated to the federal bench by George W. Bush, said the court would “hold the Government to its word” on submitting plans to both federal committees for review. In court documents, the Trump administration said above-ground construction for the ballroom would begin in April, assuming the commission approves the plans. It’s unlikely that the body will reject Trump’s plans for the controversial ballroom project because the president has stacked it with friends and allies, including White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf, who was named the commission’s chair by Trump this past July. Scharf previously defended Trump’s decision to have the century-old East Wing reduced to rubble in October by arguing that the commission’s authority only concerns construction rather than demolition or site preparation work. The White House official’s reasoning was adopted by the commission in a document published Tuesday where it said that federal law does not give it any authority to review “the demolition of buildings or general site preparation.” Earlier this month, Trump claimed the project could be completed in as soon as a year and a half, long before previous estimates floated by the White House. The $400 million project will be funded by private donors. Contributors include tech giants Amazon, Apple Google and Microsoft, crypto companies Coinbase and Ripple, the Winklevoss twins and the family of Commerce Secretary , according to a list provided by the White House. Democrats have introduced legislation to put guardrails on the project by requiring increased transparency around contributions, such as with conflicts of interest. The legislation would also prohibit the president and vice president from donating. The White House first unveiled plans for the ballroom in July, when press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that construction of the 90,000-square-foot ballroom — containing what she described as “a much-needed and exquisite addition” of “innately designed and carefully crafted space” — would begin in September. “The White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building entrance,” she said. Leavitt added that the new “White House State Ballroom” would be a “much-needed and exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square feet of innately designed and carefully crafted space, with a seated capacity of 650 people — a significant increase from the 200-person seated capacity in the East Room of the White House.” , the original architect overseeing the ballroom project, after reportedly clashing with him about the size of the proposed structure, which if built to the president’s specifications would dwarf the White House and West Wing.",The Independent,The Independent

Or the one that thousands of other returned to the White House in January and quickly ended their So Gómez found herself spending the holiday in northern Venezuela for the first time in eight years. She dressed up, cooked, got her son a scooter and smiled for her in-laws. Hard as she tried, though, she could not ignore the main challenges faced by returning migrants: unemployment and poverty. “We had a modest dinner, not quite what we’d hoped for, but at least we had food on the table,” Gómez said of the lasagna-like dish she shared with her partner and in-laws instead of the traditional Christmas dish of stuffed corn dough hallacas. “Making hallacas here is a bit expensive, and since we’re unemployed, we couldn’t afford to make them.” Gómez, her two sons and her partner returned to the city of Maracay on Oct. 27 after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to , where they were quickly swept up by U.S. Border Patrol amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. They were deported to Mexico, from where they began the dangerous journey back to Venezuela. They crossed Central America by bus, but once in Panama, the family could not afford to continue to via boat in the Caribbean. Instead, they took the cheaper route along the Pacific’s choppy waters, sitting on top of sloshing gasoline tanks in a cargo boat for several hours and then transferring to a fast boat until reaching a jungled area of Colombia. They spent about two weeks there until they were wired money to make it to the border with Venezuela. Gómez was among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who left their home country in the last decade, when its economy came undone as a result of a drop in oil prices, corruption and mismanagement. She lived in Colombia and Peru for years before setting her sights on the U.S. with hopes of building a new life. Trump’s second term has dashed the hopes of many like Gómez. As of September, more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, had returned to South America since Trump moved to limit migration to the U.S., according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. In addition, Venezuelans were steadily deported to their home country this year after President Nicolás Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Immigrants arrived regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela’s state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants returned this year on the chartered flights. Gómez’s return to Venezuela also allowed her to see the now 20-year-old daughter she left behind when she fled the country’s complex crisis. They talked and drank beer during the holiday knowing it might be the last time they share a drink for a while — Gómez’s daughter will migrate to Brazil next month. Gómez is hoping to make hallacas for New Year’s Eve and is also hoping for a job. But her prayers for next year are mostly for good health. “I ask God for many things, first and foremost life and health, so we can continue enjoying our family,” she said.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our rom gingerbread houses to frosted sugar cookies, sweets are everywhere you turn with the holiday season in full swing. If you have a big sweet tooth, you may be looking at healthier options, like sugar-free cookies or low-carb treats. But the truth is that they might not be better for you after all. Many Americans were worried about their sugar consumption this year and considered alternatives. 2025 Food & Health survey found that 75 percent of Americans were trying to reduce or avoid having sugar this year, with 22 percent opting for a “sugar-free” option when available. In addition, the global sugar-free confectionery market is estimated to grow from $42.5 billion in 2023 to $84.3 billion by 2032, Dietitians believe that the rise in sugar-free options is a result of fear-based messaging about actual sugar. “Myths like sugar being addictive or causing diseases like diabetes or cancer have been circulating in the wellness space for ages, and they just can't seem to die. Sugar has a place in a well-balanced diet,” Alison Swiggard, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist in Portland, Maine, told Health risks have also been linked to sugar substitutes. Researchers from the American Academy of Neurology recently found that people who, on average, ate more than 190 milligrams of sweeteners each day for a year had So, should you be calling sugar-free desserts the healthier option when compared to your usual sweet treats? Here’s what experts have to say. Having too much of one thing is never good — including sugar-free desserts. While they are aimed to fulfill sugar cravings without the extra calories, they often have artificial sweeteners, like sucralose, aspartame, or stevia, that can actually increase the desire for other foods. According to Avery Zenker, a Registered Dietitian in Ontario, Canada, artificial sweeteners have been linked to an altered appetite, increased inflammation, and gut microbiome disruption, which is “an imbalance in the types of microorganisms in your body” that can make you more vulnerable to infections, according to the “There’s decent evidence they alter the gut microbiome, and disrupt gut barrier function (i.e., contribute to ‘leaky gut’),” she told , referring to a condition where the intestinal lining is damaged, leading to bloating or food sensitivities. “Some people experience headaches or digestive symptoms from artificial sweeteners,” Zenker continued. “On their own, artificial sweeteners don’t have strong health benefits and may harm health.” Swiggard reiterated her concern about the ingredients in sugar-free drinks and foods. While sugar alcohols, like erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, and maltitol, make these items taste sweet, they can also irritate the gut when consumed in large quantities. “Sugar alcohols are not fully absorbed in the digestive tract, meaning they travel to the large intestine where bacteria ferment them, which can lead to more gas production, bloating, cramping, and loose stools,” she explained. maintain flavor, moisture, and structure. However, these ingredients are saturated fats, which have their own downsides. “Excessive intakes of saturated fat are linked to increased health risks, including cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats significantly reduces mortality and cardiovascular events in research,” Zenker explained. Some sugar-free desserts have a significant amount of refined carbohydrates, like wheat flour and starches. Zenker warned that consuming too many refined carbs can result in weight gain and systemic inflammation, and worsen insulin sensitivity, which is what keeps blood sugar levels stable. “The glucose from refined carbs is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. Excessive intake of refined carbs can still worsen insulin sensitivity, blood sugar regulation, and type 2 diabetes risk,” she said. “Replacing added sugar with refined carbohydrates in sugar-free desserts has minimal benefit and may worsen certain health risk markers, especially when the refined carbohydrates are high-glycemic index foods like rapidly digestible starches,” she added. Of course, there are benefits to replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners, like lessening the risk of tooth decay and cavities, according . For some people, artificial sweeteners can be a short-term way to help lose or manage weight and are consumed for medical reasons, like diabetes. Still, Swiggard recommended reading the ingredients labels on sugar-free desserts. She also encouraged people to reflect on why they’re eating these foods to begin with. “If sugar-free options feel genuinely satisfying and supportive, they can absolutely be part of holiday eating. If they feel like a rule that doesn't actually satisfy, it may be more nourishing (physically and emotionally) to enjoy traditional desserts in a relaxed way,” she explained. For those looking to make a dessert without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, Zenker recommended using natural sweeteners. “Using whole food sweeteners like dates, bananas, and applesauce can be nutrient-dense alternatives to sugar,” she said. “They still contain sugar, but it’s not linked as strongly to the health risks of refined sugar.”",The Independent,The Independent

The latest drop followed on from its publication of an pertaining to the late pedophile and sex trafficker Friday to comply with a 30-day deadline set in motion by the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act through Congress in November. However, much of what was released proved to be heavily redacted and lacking in context and was not delivered in a searchable format, as the act had expressly stipulated. The partial release drew an angry reaction from an Epstein survivors’ group, who branded it and from the lawmakers behind the original push to release the files, who said they are now weighing The department responded by firing out almost 30,000 pages of documents two days before Christmas, amounting to 10GB of data, which has only served to invite fresh questions about the late billionaire and his social circle. There were few references to the president in Friday’s batch of files but many more in the latest release. Trump has not been accused of any crime in relation to Epstein, his fellow New Yorker and one-time Florida social acquaintance, and the appearance of any person’s name in the documents does not imply wrongdoing. The president has, however, faced intense pressure since this summer to explain his past friendship with Epstein, which Trump has said ended in around 2004 when the two men had a falling out at Mar-a-Lago, the latter’s Palm Beach estate. One of the most eye-catching records included in the latest tranche of files is an internal email sent by an unnamed assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York dating from January 2020. They wrote to colleagues explaining that flight records obtained from Epstein’s private jet revealed Trump had flown in it There were at least eight such flights between 1993 and 1996 in which Trump was a passenger, according to the message, with Epstein’s former girlfriend and accomplice That appears to contradict a claim Trump made on Truth Social in January 2024, while campaigning for the presidency, in which he : “I was never on Epstein’s Plane, or at his ’stupid’ Island.” A series of emails from the bureau sent in July 2019 allude to “When you get a chance can you give me an update on the status of the 10 CO conspirators?” one from a sender with “FBI New York” signature reads. A follow-up sent two days later requests “an update on the 10 co-conspirators by COB today.” Three of the 10 alleged co-conspirators lived in Florida and were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury, according to another email from July 2019. There were others in Boston, New York City and Connecticut, the messages suggest. The only named alleged co-conspirators are Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison after she was found guilty of trafficking; former French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, who was found dead in jail in 2022; and retail mogul Leslie Wexner, who severed ties with Epstein after his indictment in Florida in the late 2000s. Another message from investigators published Tuesday notes that one of the potential co-conspirators is a “wealthy business man in Ohio,” believed to be Wexner. A legal representative for Wexner said in a statement that the prosecutor overseeing the Epstein investigation at the time said that he was not a co-conspirator nor a target. He has repeatedly denied having any knowledge of his crimes. That still leaves seven of the 10 people mentioned not identified. on social media: “Who are these 10 co-conspirators? Why haven't we seen those memos? Where are the grand jury records? Where are the FBI records? What are they hiding?” The emails also throw confusion on FBI Director Patel told Congress there was “no credible information” that Epstein trafficked women and girls to anyone other himself but the documents include references to memos sent after his death in a New York jail cell in August 2019 outlining co-conspirators that could still be charged, according to CNN. in a post on X that the latest documents disclosed include against the president that it said were “unfounded and false” and would have been “weaponized” against him previously “if they had a shred of credibility,” its first move to comment on the content of the files. also took to the same platform later in the day and the following: “There has been lots of sensationalism and even outright lies these past few days about the ‘Epstein Files.’ But let’s separate fact from fiction. “Document production is just that. We produce documents, and sometimes this can result in releasing fake or false documents because they simply are in our possession because the law requires this.” But how easy is it to “separate fact from fiction” when reviewing the documents being published, given that so little context or dating is being provided? in another X post Tuesday that a letter supposedly written by Epstein to the disgraced ex-USA Gymnastics doctor from jail, in which the writer made a crude joke about “our president” while complaining about their respective fates, was “fake”. “The letter was postmarked three days after Epstein's death out of Northern Virginia, when he was jailed in New York,” the department said. ”The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail.” That assessment is backed up by another record from the files: an FBI request from September 2019 that the letter be submitted for a handwriting analysis to determine its true authorship, although the outcome of that test does not appear to have been included. is a video sent to the FBI purporting to show the moment Epstein took his own life in his cell, which was forwarded to the bureau by a member of the public who had found it online and was interested in substantiating whether or not it was real. While those two examples appear to be relatively clear-cut, their presence underlines the importance of not necessarily believing everything you read in the Epstein files, at least without establishing its context.",The Independent,The Independent

Longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone had lobbied the president to pardon the convicted drug trafficker, but even he told the he was stunned by the speed at which Trump moved to release the notorious criminal from prison and nullify his conviction. Despite the overwhelming evidence against Hernández, the president nonsensically claimed that he’d been told by “many of the people of Honduras” that the prosecution of the former politician had been “a Biden setup.” “He was the president of the country. And they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” he said. The president later admitted to knowing “very little” about the case and suggested that the pardon was issued at the behest of political allies seeking to ensure that a right-wing, Trump-aligned candidate would win the recent presidential election in Honduras. “Well, I don’t know him, and I know very little about him, other than people said it was like a Obama, Biden-type setup,” he said. “There are many people fighting for Honduras, very good people that I know, and they think he was treated horribly, and they asked me to do it, and I said, I’ll do it.” Since returning to power in January, Trump has reveled in his use of the presidential pardon, one of the few presidential authorities that cannot be reviewed by the courts or any other branch of government — a power that is almost monarchical in scope because the framers of the U.S. Constitution adapted it from the Royal Prerogative of Mercy enjoyed British kings and queens. On the day he took office this past January, he issued a sweeping pardon of nearly all of his supporters who’d been convicted of crimes — including violent offenses — committed during the riot he fomented at the U.S. Capitol four years earlier in a last-ditch attempt to prevent certification of his 2020 election loss to Since then, he has made frequent use of the power to absolve the wealthy and well-connected of a string of serious offenses, often after being buttonholed by lobbyists, friends, allies or family members. a business associate of his son Donald Trump Jr., who had pleaded guilty to failing to prevent the use of the cryptocurrency exchange he founded by money launderers, including drug dealers and terrorists.

Trump has even granted clemency to a select few Democrats, including ex-Illinois governor Rod Blagoevich (five years after commuting his prison sentence at the end of his first term) and Texas congressman Henry Cuellar.

The 59-year-old mother of three was found dead on November 20 at the couple’s second home in the small community of Pinetop in Arizona’s White Mountains. The pair separated in August 2023 and Michael Abatti resided in El Centro, California, while Kerri Ann Abatti moved to the Arizona home, which was also near her aging parents.

Charles has long seen his role as helping to build bridges between these communities, faith groups and others, believing he is a part of society, not apart from it. The King and Queen attended major commemorations this year to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day and VJ Day, and Charles said in the broadcast: “The end of the Second World War is now remembered by fewer and fewer of us, as the years pass. “But the courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and women, and the way communities came together in the face of such great challenge, carry a timeless message for us all. “These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth. As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.” The past 12 months have seen division growing over a number of issues, from protests over the housing of asylum seekers, polarisation in the political landscape, so-called culture wars making headlines and the continued cost of living crisis widening the gap between the rich and poor and fuelling discontent between the generations. Charles’s late parents Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh were from the wartime generation and footage was shown of an event marking the VE Day anniversary, with the Prince of Wales and Prince George meeting Second World War veterans at a Buckingham Palace tea party, and another video of the King taking part in a VJ Day ceremony. The King went on to comment on examples of right overcoming wrong at home and overseas: “These stories of the triumph of courage over adversity give me hope, from our venerable military veterans to selfless humanitarian workers in this century’s most dangerous conflict zones; to the ways in which individuals and communities display spontaneous bravery, instinctively placing themselves in harm’s way to defend others.” The broadcast showed Charles at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester, where he visited survivors of the October terror attack and met those who blocked the doors as a knife-wielding assailant tried to get in. An arch in Sydney, Australia, with the words Bondi Beach was seen in footage followed by hundreds of floral tributes left after two gunmen targeted a Jewish festival, killing 15 people. The widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, Syrian-born immigrant Ahmed al Ahmed, was shot after wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen. Commenting on busy modern lives and the effects of new technologies on communities and individuals, especially the young, the King said: “Indeed, as our world seems to spin ever faster, our journeying may pause, to quieten our minds – in TS Eliot’s words ‘At the still point of the turning world’ – and allow our souls to renew. “In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.” An aide to the King said: “I think His Majesty hopes that, if nothing else, Christmas might afford a moment when people could experiment with something of a ‘digital detox’ to focus more on our friendships, our families and our faith for those who practise.“ The address, recorded on 11 December in Westminster Abbey’s Lady Chapel, made no reference to Charles’s recent “good news” announcement about reducing his cancer treatment, reflecting his wish for his message to mirror society’s experiences during the past 12 months. There was a strong religious element in the address to the nation and Commonwealth from the King, a committed Anglican Christian, whose key theme was pilgrimage, and he emphasised the Biblical journeys made by Mary and Joseph, arriving “homeless” in Bethlehem, and the three wise men and shepherds to pay homage to the baby Jesus. Charles’s recent state visit to the Vatican celebrated the Papal Jubilee year themed “Pilgrims of Hope”, and Westminster Abbey is a pilgrim church as it contains the shrine of the canonised Edward the Confessor, whose tomb has attracted pilgrims for centuries. George featured again in footage with his father William making a private visit to the homeless charity The Passage, where they donned aprons and helped prepare food. The figures in the Christmas story relied on “companionship and kindness of others” during their pilgrimages and found “inner strength” to deal with physical and mental challenges. Charles added: “To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope: of resilience in the face of adversity; peace through forgiveness; simply getting to know our neighbours and, by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.” Members of the royal family were featured during the broadcast, from Camilla in a red phone box with a group of children during a visit to Dulwich Picture Gallery and William and the Duchess of Edinburgh clinking paper cups of gin at the Royal Cornwall Show. The Christmas message of “peace and reconciliation” delivered by angels when they proclaimed the arrival of Jesus – “the greatest pilgrimage of all” – was a “prayer for our times and our communities”, said the King in conclusion. Charles’s continued support for Ukraine since the early period of Russia’s invasion was reflected in the choice of choir, Songs for Ukraine Chorus, who closed the broadcast by singing the hugely popular “Carol Of The Bells”, based on a song by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych.",The Independent,The Independent

Goodnight.” The footage played over the 2009 Mumford & Sons hit Newsom’s video then showed a grainy image of Trump inside Epstein’s desk that was initially published by the Justice Department on December 19, the deadline set by Congress to release all of the files. The image was removed the next day by officials “out of an abundance of caution for further review” and was later reposted. But critics were quick to notice the photo had been taken down, which only fueled further speculation over whether the department was withholding evidence of Trump in the files. “DOJ defends removing Trump photo from Epstein files,” a headline read alongside the image in the video posted by Newsom.

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson stated: ""Time and time again victims of crime are left without the support they need, it’s a disgrace and communities deserve so much better. “The previous Conservative government betrayed our communities with years of self-defeating cuts to our police forces – and now the current Labour Government must not turn a blind eye to this epidemic.

A Home Office spokesman commented: ""Vehicle theft has a devastating impact on individuals, families, businesses, and the wider industry. For too long, not enough has been done to prevent these crimes or to bring those responsible to justice. “This Government and the police are taking decisive action to change that – from introducing new laws to ban electronic devices used to steal vehicles, to training police officers on the methods used to steal vehicles and working with industry to address vulnerabilities in vehicles.""",The Independent,The Independent

Read our supporters who say he should stand down to give the Party a chance of staying in power. Asked in a poll if they would have a better chance of winning the next election if Starmer is replaced, Labour voters said ‘yes’ by an overwhelming three to one margin. Equally damning, they say Starmer is the worst Labour Prime Minister in history. is runaway favourite among Labour supporters to take over from Sir Keir. They are the findings of a JL Partners survey for the commissioned the poll after it emerged earlier this month that Labour Together, the Labour campaign group credited with helping Starmer win power, had secretly conducted a survey on his popularity among its members. The results of the Labour Together survey have not been published. But they are likely to mirror the results of the poll, which included the same two key questions: should Starmer resign; and if so, which of a list of eight named potential alternative candidates should succeed him. It comes amid continuing speculation surrounding Starmer’s future and a series of alleged plots by Labour MPs and Cabinet rivals to depose him. Asked in the JL Partners poll if Labour would do better or worse at the next election if Starmer resigned, a total of 38 per cent of those who voted Labour in the 2024 General Election said it would do better, compared with just 13 per cent who said it would do worse. A further 39 per cent said it would make no difference, while 10 per cent were unsure. Among voters from all parties, 29 per cent said Labour would perform better without Starmer, while 14 per cent thought it would do worse. Forty-four per cent said a change in leadership would make no difference, and 13 per cent did not know. Astonishingly, Labour voters have even less faith in Starmer’s ability to win than among the wider general public. The three to one margin among Labour voters in favour of him resigning to boost Labour’s prospects compares to a two to one margin among voters from all parties. A total of 39 per cent of Labour voters said getting rid of Starmer would make no difference to the Party’s election hopes; ten per cent did not offer an opinion. Asked who should replace Starmer if he were to step down, 19 per cent of 2024 Labour voters chose Andy Burnham as their preferred successor. was backed by 10 per cent, Lucy Powell by nine per cent, Wes Streeting and Ed Miliband by six per cent each, Shabana Mahmood by four per cent, Bridget Phillipson by three per cent and Darren Jones by two per cent. Fifteen per cent said they would not support any of the listed candidates, while 26 per cent were undecided. Significantly, all of the top three alternative leaders picked by Labour supporters are to the Left of Starmer from a political perspective. That might help Labour see off the challenge from the Green Party, which has seen a revival under new leader Zac Polanski. But it could make it harder to stop Labour voters in the so called ‘Red Wall’ constituencies in the Party’s traditional northern heartlands haemorrhaging to Nigel Farage’s right-wing Reform Party. Notably, Labour voters in the North West are most emphatic that the Party would benefit by ditching Starmer: a total of 14 per cent of such voters in this region said Labour would do ‘much better’ if it replaced him. A total of 15 per cent of Labour voters said they would not support any of the eight suggested candidates; 30 per cent offered no opinion. Mr Burnham was also the clear first choice to replace Starmer among all voters. Starmer has made it clear he is determined to lead Labour into the next election. However, even if he is forced out, currently Mr Burnham would be unable to stand in any Labour leadership contest because he is not an MP. Under Labour rules, only MPs can run for leader. Further evidence of Starmer’s unpopularity came when Labour voters were asked to rank him alongside all seven Labour prime ministers in the party’s history, dating back to the first, Ramsay McDonald in the 1920s. They judged Starmer to be the worst of all - with Tony Blair rated as the second worst. In the Labour Together poll, members were asked to name politicians who stood ‘the best chance of leading Labour to electoral victory at the next general election’ compared with Starmer. They were also asked to rank those they would be likely to back in a leadership race and asked for their views on a range of issues. James Johnson of JL Partners said: “The results underline the degree to which all voters have lost faith in Keir Starmer. What will worry Downing St most is the belief that Labour would do better under a new leader is strongest among Labour supporters themselves. “It suggests that unless the Prime Minister can win back their confidence there is a real danger he may be forced to step down at some point. “Labour supporters appear to want someone who is more Left wing but there is no guarantee that is the best way to achieve electoral success.”",The Independent,The Independent

Under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper. May God Bless our Military, and MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.” the U.S. worked with Nigeria to carry out the strikes and they’d been approved by that country’s government. Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the cooperation included exchange of intelligence and strategic coordination in ways “consistent with international law, mutual respect for sovereignty and shared commitments to regional and global security.” “Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria’s values and to international peace and security,” the ministry said in a statement.

There are also armed insurgent groups operating in the nation, including the Islamic extremist organization Boko Haram, which has also targeted Muslims, Much of northern Nigeria has been struck by conflict in an ongoing security crisis and Trump has singled the country out for what he calls “the killing of Christians” by “radical Islamists.” Victims and church leaders have reiterated Trump’s claims that Christians are persecuted, saying they’ve long been attacked, kidnapped or killed over their faith.

Know your consumer rights,2025-12-26T00:57:31.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our You’ve been given an ugly t-shirt and a book you’ve already read. But if you don’t have the receipts, can you return them? Or what if someone’s given you a Before you box up your unwanted presents and head to the shops, here’s what the Australian Consumer Law – the rules on ’ rights and business responsibilities – says about asking for a return, exchange or refund under different circumstances. Australian consumer law generally doesn’t require retailers to accept returns for change of mind alone. So if you just didn’t like the gift, that’s not enough under the law to be able to ask for the money back. If a business has a “change of mind” returns policy, they have to honour it. Otherwise, they may get in trouble for “misleading conduct” under the consumer law. allowing change of mind returns, they usually have a list of exceptions, including underwear, beauty products, food and more – so check their rules. All retailers will want to see some proof of purchase – though not necessarily the original receipt. If a product is defective, under Australian consumer law shoppers have a lot more rights than many people realise. It can help to use the phrase “Australian consumer law” so the retailer knows you’re aware of your rights. What you can ask for depends on whether or not there’s a “major failure” of your basic rights under consumer law, known as “consumer guarantees”. A “major failure” of a consumer guarantee is when the product: In these cases, you’re entitled to your choice of a replacement product or a full refund, if you can produce either a receipt or other proof of purchase. For other more minor failures that can be remedied, the business only has to repair it for free within a reasonable time. It doesn’t have to offer you a replacement or refund. However, if you’ve caused damage to the product yourself, you may not be able to rely on the consumer guarantees. There are exceptions to the consumer guarantees. For instance, some don’t apply to goods sold by auction. And most don’t apply to “non-business” sellers, such as private sellers on Gumtree or Facebook Marketplace. If the product is faulty in one of the ways above, you’re still entitled to those consumer law remedies – even if the original But if you’re returning for change of mind, most retailers require the product to be in saleable condition, with packaging intact. You need proof of purchase to establish your right to consumer guarantees, but this doesn’t have to be a receipt. Other types of proof of purchase can include: The law doesn’t specify exactly what proof of purchase is sufficient. The consumer just needs to be able to reasonably prove they bought the item. So if was a gift, you’re likely to need some help from the gift-giver. Importantly, you don’t have to have an original copy: photos and photocopies also count. So if you’re ever buying something expensive, take a photo of your receipt immediately. It can save you time and money later. Katharine Kemp is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Law & Justice at UNSW Sydney. This article is republished from For faulty products, Australian consumer law rights apply whether the gift was bought online or in a shop. A guarantee that’s especially helpful for online purchases is that goods must “correspond with the description”. For example, you would be entitled to your choice of a refund or replacement if the photo advertising a suitcase showed or described a combination lock as a feature, but the one you received had no lock. If the product’s faulty, it’s illegal for businesses to refer to store policies or terms and conditions that deny your right to consumer guarantees – such as policies saying “no refunds or exchanges on sale items”. If you think a business hasn’t delivered on Australia’s consumer law guarantees, you may be able to ask for a repair, replacement, refund, cancellation or compensation for damages or loss.

Read our on Friday approved a record defense budget plan exceeding 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year, aiming to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals as tensions rise in the region. The draft budget for fiscal 2026 beginning April is up 9.4% from 2025 and marks the fourth year of Japan’s ongoing five-year program to double annual arms spending to 2% of gross domestic product. The increase comes as Japan faces elevated tension from said in November that her country's military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Takaichi’s government, under U.S. pressure for a military increase, pledged to achieve the 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned. Japan also plans to revise the ongoing security and defense policy by December 2026 to further strengthen its military. Missiles and drones will add to southwestern island defense The new budget plan allocates more than 970 billion yen ($6.2 billion) to bolster Japan's “standoff” missile capability. It includes a 177 billion-yen ($1.13 billion) purchase of domestically developed and upgraded Type-12 surface-to-ship missiles with a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). The first batch of the Type-12 missiles will be deployed in Japan's southwestern Kumamoto prefecture by March, a year earlier than planned, as Japan accelerates its missile buildup in the region. The current security strategy names China as the country's biggest strategic challenge and calls for more offensive roles for Japan’s Self-Defense Force under its security alliance with the U.S. In part due to Japan's aging and declining population and its struggles with an understaffed military, the government believes unmanned weapons are essential. To defend the coasts, Japan will spend 100 billion yen ($640 million) to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillace and defense under a system called “SHIELD"" planned for March 2028, defense ministry officials said. For speedier deployment, Japan initially plans to rely mainly on imports, possibly from Turkey or Israel. The budget announcement comes as Japan’s row with China escalate following Takaichi's remark in November that Japanese military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own. The disagreement escalated this month when Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan prompted Tokyo to protest when Chinese aircraft locked their radar on Japanese aircraft, which is considered possible preparation for firing missiles. The Defense Ministry, already been alarmed by China’s rapid expansion of operations in the Pacific, will open a new office dedicated to studying operations, equipment and other necessities for Japan to deal with China's Pacific activity. Two Chinese aircraft carriers were spotted in June almost simultaneously operating near southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time, fueling Tokyo’s concern about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and areas around the disputed East China Sea islands. Japan plans joint development of frigates and jets Japan is pushing to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry by participating in joint development with friendly nations, and promoting foreign sales, after drastically easing arms export restrictions in recent years. For 2026, Japan plans to spend more than 160 billion yen ($1 billion) to jointly develop a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy for deployment in 2035. There also are plans for research and development of AI-operated drones designed to fly with the jet. In a major boost to the country's defense industry, Australia selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in August to upgrade Mogami-class frigate to replace its fleet of 11 ANZAC-class ships. Japan's budget allocates nearly 10 billion yen ($64 million) to support industry base and arms sales. The budget plan requires parliamentary approval by March to be implemented as part of a 122.3 trillion yen ($784 billion) national budget bill. The five-year defense buildup program would bring Japan's annual spending to around 10 trillion yen ($64 billion), making it the world’s third-largest spender after the U.S. and China. Japan will clear the 2% target by March as promised, the Finance Ministry said.

Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so,” Trump The president was friendly with Epstein decades ago, calling him a “terrific guy” in a 2002 magazine profile. In the midst of the Epstein controversy, in 2003, but the president has denied that he authored such a letter and is suing the outlet and its owners. But Trump has said their relationship ended before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. The White House has said Trump did “nothing wrong” and that the president kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for being a “creep.” Trump suggested in Wednesday’s Truth Social post that the people who thought Epstein was “the greatest guy on earth” were Democrats. “When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt...and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do...Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!” Trump wrote. last Friday — after Congress pushed through legislation to force the Trump administration to reveal all the information it had on the convicted sex offender — In one photo, Clinton and Epstein were smiling as they stood next to each other wearing silky shirts.

Everybody was friendly with this guy.” Trump showed concern for how the Epstein files could ruin people’s reputations. “You probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago.” The president warned again on Wednesday of the consequences the Epstein files, which have not all been released yet, could have on people’s reputations. “So many of their friends, mostly innocent, will be badly hurt and reputationally tarnished.

Read our have been urged to spend Boxing Day using up Christmas dinner leftovers amid figures suggesting food waste will cost a family of four an average of £1,000 this year. Households are set to throw away around 85,000 tonnes of edible Christmas food this festive season alone, according to estimates from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) and the Office for National Statistics. are generated by UK homes from wasted consumable food and drink each year, Throughout the year, almost 40% of food waste happens because it is not used in time – either because people think the product smells or looks off or it is past its date label, a study for the organisation found. Each year, UK households threw out 480,000 tonnes of potatoes – or 41% of all potatoes bought. Wrap has urged households to store potatoes – and all other uncut fruit and vegetables except for onions, bananas and whole pineapples – in the fridge at 5C or below. It also reminded consumers that food past its ‘best before’ date is safe to eat for days, months or even years afterwards, and people should use their own judgment to decide if their food is edible. However, ‘use by’ labels refer to safety, and food should not be eaten past this date. Wrap chief executive Catherine David said: “A third of all the food we grow is wasted, and it’s so noticeable at Christmas, a time when we want to put on a feast, but at the same time household budgets are particularly stretched. “We can make our cash go further, and protect our planet’s precious resources, this Christmas by ensuring we make the most of our leftovers and follow Love Food Hate Waste’s simple tips and tricks to ensure we love our food, hate our waste, and make sure as much food as possible goes onto people’s plates and into their tummies.” said: “Over half of food waste happens in our homes so reheating extra roasties and making the traditional turkey curry can save money and cut carbon emissions. “Together with the Government’s £13.5 million grants to food charities to redistribute 19,000 tonnes of surplus food from farms, small changes can make the Christmas food shop go further and end up in the freezer not the food waste caddy.” The focus on food waste comes as appliance brands launch built-in AI tools to help consumers use up the contents of their fridges and freezers. Hisense’s ConnectLife app now features Dish Designer, which uses AI to create customised recipes from the contents of its fridges and freezers – a similar feature to Samsung’s Bespoke AI fridge freezers which have touchscreen displays that generate recipes, largely by scanning what is inside the fridge. Hisense’s Dish Designer can personalise recipes depending on households’ dietary requirements, and members can add products in the fridge and cupboards to an ‘inventory’, which is used to generate recipes. Hisense said approximately 30,000 recipes had been generated in total across Of these, around 12,000 recipes were generated in the UK.

Read our with a new name added to the mix. While the 2028 election is still three years away, some can’t help but speculate who will end up on the ticket. While there’s been talk about , there’s one Democrat some may be overlooking. ’s name popped up in a recent panel discussion on CNN’s ’s first Black senator in 2021 and has been a pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church for about two decades. On Wednesday, CNN’s Dana Bash had her panel look at the odds of prominent Democrats Bash said Newsom’s odds “shot up,” showing that he has a 36 percent chance at being the Democratic presidential nominee. “And in fact, he shot up in August when he started the fight for, which he won, for Prop50 to change the [congressional] maps in response to the fact that Texas changed the maps mid-decade. AOC is very far behind him. And [former Vice President] Kamala Harris even behind AOC,” Bash said. Ocasio-Cortez had a 9 percent chance at the nomination and Bloomberg opinion columnist Nia Malika Henderson later chimed in: “The other person I might add to that is Raphael Warnock out of Georgia, who is [an] incredibly talented politician, has won in Georgia, just recently gave a speech about spirituality and affordability at the Center for American Progress. So, he is the one I think, to that list of 500 people, I would add him.” NBC News’ Kristen Welker mentioned Warnock’s Center for American Progress speech on earlier this month and asked how faith can address “the deepening divides” in America. Warnock said, “There’s kind of a spiritual heaviness in the land as people see a deepening and widening chasm between what they need from their government. Everything is basic as the safety of their children when they leave them…on a school campus all the way to healthcare. And as that chasm broadens, I think a kind of cynicism and despair sets in. “And rather than people turning toward each other, they are tempted to turn on each other. And that creates just the kind of atmosphere where strongmen emerge, promising to solve all of our problems in one fell swoop. We have to resist that and recognize that the way to our own wholeness and well being is to affirm the humanity of our neighbors,” he added. Warnock later added, “Donald Trump, if he’s better at something than anybody else, it’s dividing us.” , saying that people’s “cost for health are doubling while Congress engages in everyday political games. They’re seeing their utility costs go up, their grocery costs go up.” While affordability still remains an issue for many Americans, inflation is cooling. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks changes in the prices consumers pay for goods and services, found that in November, down from 3 percent in September. Trump later lashed out at Warnock on Truth Social, writing, “Warnock spent the entire show using Religion to try and divide the Country! If a Republican, in particular ME, made those statements, it would be FRONT PAGE NEWS. He ended by saying that he was going to his Church to preach now, and while I think that’s fine, I do say, ‘What ever happened to separation of Church and State?’ That would be the first thing they would use against us but, actually, it’s something that never much bothered me.” In response to his attack, Warnock said in an Instagram video, “Mr. President, my faith is not a weapon, it’s a bridge, and I invite you to Bible study. Maybe you can meet the Jesus I know. In the meantime, I’m going to keep fighting for the people.” While some are predicting nominees for the 2028 presidential election, Democrats have a more pressing matter — .

Read our will hold the first phase of a general election on Sunday, its first vote in five years and an exercise that critics say will neither restore the country's fragile democracy undone by a 2021 army takeover, nor end a devastating civil war triggered by the nation’s harsh military rule. The military has framed the polls as a return to multi-party democracy, likely seeking to add a facade of legitimacy to its rule, which began after the army four years ago ousted the elected government of The takeover triggered widespread popular opposition that has grown into a civil war. The fighting has complicated holding the polls in many contested areas. Voting will be held in different parts of the country in three phases, with the second on Jan. 11 and the third on Jan. 25. Human rights and opposition groups say the vote will be neither free nor fair and that power is likely to remain in the hands of military leader Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. Critics doubt a real transition to civilian rule Richard Horsey, a Myanmar analyst for the International Crisis Group, noted that the vote is being run by the same military that was behind the 2021 coup. “These elections are not credible at all,” he told The Associated Press. ”They do not include any of the political parties that did well in the last election or the election before.” Horsey says the military’s strategy is for its favored Union Solidarity and Development Party to win in a landslide, shifting Myanmar from direct military rule to a government with a “civilian veneer” that perpetuates army control. That would allow the military to claim that holding the election showed progress towards inclusiveness in the spirit of a peace proposal by the 11-member , that calls for “constructive dialogue among all parties concerned"" so they can ""seek a peaceful solution in the interests of the people.” It would also provide an excuse for neighbors like China, India and to continue their support, which they contend promotes stability in Myanmar. Western nations have maintained sanctions against Myanmar's ruling generals because of their anti-democratic actions and brutal war on their opponents. The army seized power on Feb. 1, 2021, claiming the 2020 election — won in a landslide by Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy — was illegitimate because of alleged large-scale voter registration irregularities. Independent observers, however, found no major problems. On Sunday, ballots will be cast in 102 of the country’s 330 townships. Further rounds will follow on Jan. 11 and Jan. 25, leaving 65 townships where there would be no voting because of the ongoing conflict with ethnic guerrilla groups and resistance forces. Though 57 parties have fielded candidates, most are posting candidates only in their own home states or regions. Six parties are competing nationwide and have a chance of winning enough seats to wield political power, but the rules make it likely the pro-military USDP will emerge in position to lead a new government. In total, nearly 5,000 candidates are competing for more than 1,100 seats in the two chambers of the national legislature and in state and regional legislatures, though the actual number of seats that will be filled will be less where constituencies are not voting. The Union Election Commission has yet to release the total number of eligible voters, but in 2020, there were more than 37 million. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party are not participating Myanmar’s 80-year-old former leader and her party are not taking part in the election. Suu Kyi is currently serving a 27-year prison term on charges widely seen as bogus and politically motivated. Her National League party was dissolved after refusing to officially register under the new military rules. Other parties are also boycotting the vote or have declined to run under conditions they say are unfair. Opposition groups have also called for a boycott by voters. Amael Vier, an analyst for the Asian Network for Free Elections, noted recently that Myanmar’s political parties that won 90% of the seats in 2020 no longer exist today. An Election Protection Law with harsh penalties enacted this year put even more restrictions on political activity, effectively barring all public criticism of the polls. More than 200 people have been charged for leafleting or online activity over the past few months. All this likely sets the stage for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party to dominate the polls — and for 69-year-old Min Aung Hlaing to take over as president. The human cost of Myanmar's conflict has been high. According to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 22,000 people are currently detained for political offenses and over 7,600 civilians have been killed by security forces since the army seized power. There are more than 3.6 million internally displaced people, most driven from their homes by warfare, marking a major humanitarian crisis. “Myanmar is witnessing intensified violence, repression, and intimidation ahead of military-controlled elections,” the U.N. Office said. It added that civilians are being threatened by both military authorities and armed opposition groups regarding participation. Amnesty International researcher Joe Freeman said that many fear the election will only entrench the power of those responsible for years of unlawful killings. Horsey, of the International Crisis Group, believes that after the polls, Myanmar is likely to see increased conflict as opponents attempt to prove the military still lacks popular legitimacy.",The Independent,The Independent

That is our Ukrainian heart, our faith in Appearing to refer to Russian president Vladimir Putin, Mr Zelensky added: “Today, we all share one dream. “And we make one wish – for all of us. ‘May he perish’, each of us may think to ourselves. But when we turn to God, of course, we ask for something greater, we ask for peace for Ukraine. We fight for it, we pray for it, we deserve it.” His comments come after Russia hit regions across Ukraine with missiles and drones on Tuesday, killing at least three people, and triggering emergency power outages. Further attacks on Christmas night saw at least two people killed in drone strikes on Odesa and Kharkiv. Ukraine’s leader said in his address: “On the eve of Christmas, the Russians once again showed who they truly are. “Massive shelling, hundreds of ‘shaheds’, ballistic missiles, Kinzhal strikes – everything was used. This is how the godless strike. “For all our fallen heroes who defended Ukraine at the cost of their lives. For everyone whom Russia has driven into occupation and forced to flee. “For those for whom it is hard, but who have not lost Ukraine within themselves – and therefore Ukraine will never lose them. Today we stand shoulder to shoulder. We will not lose our way in the darkness.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Mr Putin had wished US president Donald Trump a merry Christmas and sent him a congratulatory message. American negotiators have engaged in a series of talks with Ukraine and Russia separately since Mr Trump presented a plan to end the war last month – a proposal widely seen as favouring Moscow, which invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago. Since then, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have worked to pull the plan closer to Kyiv's position. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that there has been “slow but steady progress” in the peace talks. Mr Zelensky has said that he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war. Ukraine’s president explained that he would be open to this if Moscow also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces. The US has proposed the creation of a “free economic zone”, which Mr Zelensky said should be demilitarised. A similar arrangement could be possible for the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control. But any peace plan would need to be put to a referendum, the president has insisted. Meanwhile, Russian air defence units downed 25 Moscow-bound Ukrainian drones throughout the day on Wednesday, according to Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin. Ukraine’s military said its drones overnight had struck the Yefremov synthetic rubber plant in Russia's Tula region south of Moscow and a storage facility for marine drones in Russian-occupied Crimea. Tula regional governor Dmitry Milyaev said debris from a downed Ukrainian drone sparked a fire at an industrial site. The Ukrainian military also said that an oil refinery in Russia’s Rostov region had been hit with Storm Shadow missiles, causing multiple explosions. Polish jets also intercepted a Russian reconnaissance plane over the Baltic Sea, which was flying close to its airspace, the Polish military said on Thursday.

Patolli is one of the oldest ludo-like strategy board games played in the Americas by the Aztecs and the earlier of 52 spaces, drawn on cloth or even the ground, while patol beans marked with a dot on one side are thrown to function like dice. But exactly how the game was played in ancient Mayan societies remained unclear. Recent excavations at Naachtun in northern Petén, once a Maya regional capital, offer clues about how people played the game, and its parallels to other sports in the region. Researchers unearthed a board carved on the ground, made of small red mosaic tiles likely collected from broken ceramic vessels, parts of which they dated to the fourth century AD. Since some sections of the board were destroyed, the overall structure could only be estimated. Archaeologists estimated the board was originally almost 78cm wide and 110cm long, with 45 squares made using 478 tile sections. The mosaic tile sections make the board one of its kind in the ancient world, researchers say. They suspect the use of mosaic indicates the board “must have been included in the architectural design from the moment of construction”. “Floor mosaics are exceptionally rare in Maya architecture,” researchers noted in a new study published in the journal “While there are countless examples of portable artefacts fabricated or decorated with the mosaic technique, in shell, iron-ore, jade, or turquoise,” they said, “to the best of our knowledge, no clear example of a floor mosaic exists in this part of the Western Hemisphere before the colonial period.” Its construction technique offers a fresh perspective into how this board game was played by the Maya, researchers say, adding that the use of mosaic hints at a “longer use life” than etched or painted boards.

Read our “Heated Rivalry” is scoring big with hockey romance fans. Since its Thanksgiving weekend debut, the steamy television adaptation of Rachel Reid’s 2019 novel has dominated social media feeds and inspired a growing fanbase devoted to the queer romance at its center. The story traces Canadian Shane Hollander and Russian Ilya Rozanov as they sustain a decade-long secret relationship, mixing slow-building yearning with explicit sexual scenes. Jacob Tierney, who developed, wrote and directed the series, said he was drawn to the project for its “pure queer joy.” Audiences have met that joy with a passionate response, propelling “Heated Rivalry” to the No. 1 series on as the first season heads into its finale Friday. Along the way, it’s generated new interest in the “Game Changers” book series that it’s based on and drawn attention to sports romance fiction, especially stories with queer storylines. Originally developed for the Canadian streaming service Crave, the show scored a distribution deal with and has already been renewed for a second season. “Unashamedly, when pitching, it was just like, this is a Harlequin romance. This has a happy ending,” Tierney said. “This is about two boys in love and a lot of sex.” romance books have grown in popularity within the broader sports romance genre, fueled by readers drawn to the intensity of sport as much as the relationships at its center. Mackenzie Walton, who edited the “Heated Rivalry” novel, said the genre’s staying power comes from how deeply the stories immerse readers in the sport itself. “It’s much more common when I read a hockey romance that I get the sense that hockey is important at the heart of the book, and I think readers really respond to that sense of authenticity,” Walton said. According to the book’s publisher Harlequin, Reid’s six novel “Game Changers” series has sold 650,000 copies since the first was published in 2018. pays attention to, and respects, romance fans, they notice and show their appreciation,” Leah Koch, co-owner of the romance bookstore The Ripped Bodice, wrote in an email. She added that producing a high-quality adaptation of a story queer readers might not have expected to reach television signals a growing recognition of both their cultural interests and their economic impact. videos about the show since its November premiere. He believes part of the show's popularity with queer fans is the slow-burning aspect of Shane and Ilya’s romance. “There’s something nice about seeing the yearning and seeing that they do maintain contact with each other and still have this connection,” Banfield said. Finding the perfect Shane and Ilya for ‘Heated Rivalry’ Fans and the creators behind the book and TV show also credit the lead actors, Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, for the show’s success. Tierney said he knew they were his Ilya and Shane almost instantly. “The show was going to live and die based on this casting,” Tierney said. “I think once they did their chemistry read together, everybody was like, ‘OK, fine, done.’” Rachel Reid, author of the books, said she was happy with the adaptation and with who was chosen to play the characters she wrote. “If I built the perfect actors in a lab, I could not have built better people to play these characters,” Reid said. It was also important to both Tierney and Reid to have Shane played by someone of Asian descent, as the character is in the books, to keep a sense of diversity in a genre that tends to have mostly white characters. Hockey romances still tend to be dominantly white and heterosexual. According to Koch, readers who come to the Ripped Bodice's locations are looking for more people like Shane — queer and diverse — to be in their stories. Customers frequently seek out queer sports romances and those that “go beyond the typical alpha-jock trope,” she wrote. But she’s skeptical that the success of “Heated Rivalry” will lead to more mainstream books or shows with queer stories. “A breakthrough title does sometimes allow other authors more access, but not always,” Koch wrote. “But hey, maybe they’ll prove me wrong, and wouldn’t that be nice?” Romance blogger Laura Dusi-Showers said women in particular are responding to the male-on-male romance in a hockey book because of the fantasy aspect of seeing something different than their everyday lives. As for why it works, she said it was due to hockey being a “manly, aggressive sport” with no out NHL players. “I think it’s opening people’s eyes to what could be,” Dusi-Showers said. This was the reason Reid wrote her books in the first place: wanting to tell a different story. “The series just came from a love of hockey, but also my own conflicted feelings about all the bad things about the culture around the sport, especially the homophobia,” Reid said. Reid’s debut book in her hockey series, “Game Changer,” is about Scott Hunter, the fictional first fictional hockey player to come out publicly, and his juice-bar barista boyfriend Kip Grady. Part of this story was told in “Heated Rivalry’s” third episode and featured as a climactic moment in the fifth episode. As to why fans are responding so strongly to the show and the actors, Reid singled out the acting. “They’re getting really, really emotional or excited about one little quiet part or one line delivery, and that has nothing to do with the sex on the show,” she said, pointing specifically to Williams’ performance as the more awkward and less self-assured Shane. “Maybe a choice that Hudson made as an actor is making everybody lose their minds, and I love to see that.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Throngs of feral cats emerge from the shade of parked trucks and bushes as soon as the familiar . They run after the vehicle to a certain meal — a gravy train that might not be around much longer. A Hawaii County law set to take effect at the start of the new year bans feeding feral animals on county property. It's an effort to protect native species, such as an endangered goose called the nene, from a super predator introduced to the islands by Europeans in the 18th century. But the measure doesn't sit well with many cat lovers, including the driver of the Subaru, Liz Swan, who has been feeding feral felines on the Big Island for 33 years. “I don’t believe the cats should be exterminated at the expense of the nene,” Swan said. “They’re both living creatures.” It's unclear how many feral cats — abandoned pets and their descendants — live on the Big Island. Estimates range well into the tens of thousands, with pockets of dense colonies supported by people. Opponents of the ban say it will hamper their efforts to contain the population by trapping and neutering the animals — and that hungry cats will then have to hunt for food. About 200 cats live at the Kealakehe Transfer Station and Recycling Center, not far from the bustling tourist district of . Swan shows up every late afternoon with water and kibble, and says she's never seen a nene anywhere near the dump. Despite living amid trash, the cats there generally appear robust, most of them missing the tip of an ear, indicating they’ve been spayed or neutered. The cats threaten the native species directly — by killing them — and indirectly, biologists say. left out for the cats can attract native animals, bringing them into closer contact with humans. Cat feces can also spread a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that has killed endangered Hawaiian monk seals and native birds. Last year, a male nene — pronounced “neh-neh” — was struck and killed by a car as it crossed a road in Hilo, on the eastern side of the island, to reach a cat feeding station. The goose's surviving mate, which also had a gosling die of toxoplasmosis in 2024, has recently taken on another partner and is nesting in a Hilo park, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources announced this month. The county's feeding ban will help protect them, the department said. State wildlife biologist Raymond McGuire recently checked for nene nesting sites among the barren black-rock fields near a shopping center at the Waikoloa resort. It's not their traditional habitat, but he has seen the geese fly in to grab food — risking getting hit by cars — and last year some nested there. As he approached, a pair of feline eyes peered out of a crack in the lava rock. emerged from their nooks, perhaps mistaking him for someone who might offer food. McGuire was relieved to see there were no nene nearby — but frustrated with evidence the cats are being fed: empty water bowls and aluminum pans. He's a cat owner — ""my favorite animal is a cat"" — but as a Hawaiian whose love of nature inspired him to pursue conservation work, he believes there is no room for them where native species are struggling to survive. “There's so many birds that my kids will never see, that I got to see,” he said, referring to native forest birds. “I think about my ancestors and I do wonder: Are we honoring them well in what we do? Because they did take steps to protect them.” Feral cats are a problem in many places, but Hawaii's sensitive ecosystem is full of species that evolved without mammalian predators, making them especially vulnerable, McGuire said. Hawaiian culture is closely tied to Hawaii’s animals; aumakua, or ancestral spirit guides, can take animal form, noted Big Island Mayor Kimo Alameda. His family's aumakua is the shark, he said. After the county council passed the measure with a veto-proof 6-2 vote, Alameda decided to let it take effect without his signature. Opponents persuaded him it would harm the cats. “I had a soft spot for that,” he said. “I felt bad for the cats.” The debate was so contentious that some opponents sent him hate messages, Alameda said. The mayor said he hopes police consider enforcement a low priority. Violations carry fines of up to $50 for a first offense and up to $500 for subsequent offenses. Will the ban prompt feeders to work in secret? The answer is simple to Makaʻala Kaʻaumoana, a cultural practitioner — someone who works to preserve Hawaiian cultural traditions — on the island of Kauai. Trapping, neutering and releasing cats makes no difference because they can still hunt, she said. “The cats have to be removed,"" she said. Debbie Cravatta, who feeds cats in her West Hawaii neighborhood, questioned why. “It’s a native species — why does that reign over a domestic cat that somebody dumped out pregnant and that had six kittens out in the wild?"" Cravatta said. ""Why is that life more valuable than this life?” Opponents also argue the ban might only push feeding efforts underground. “I'm not going to let them starve,” Swan said.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our When Fernando Dávila was 8 years old in , he failed a drawing class because he painted donkeys red. There was a reason for that: He is colorblind. Now the 72-year-old Dávila is an established and respected artist whose vibrant paintings have been exhibited in “I have the most wonderful job in the world, which is painting every morning,” Dávila said from his studio in a Miami suburb. “To mix colors. To have joy to share with the world, that's really my passion.” He started off painting only in black and white until he was around 30 years old because of his colorblindness, a congenital condition which makes it difficult for people to tell the difference between certain colors, particularly red and green, and shades of color. There is no cure for the condition, which for Dávila also makes the colors pink, violet, turquoise and yellow-green confusing. Since the mid-1980s, Dávila has painted in color through the help of glasses developed by an ophthalmologist in , where Dávila was living at the time. One lens is transparent and the other is shaded red, and they help him discriminate between contrasting shades that normally blur together. With the lenses, he can see almost two-thirds of the colors, but without them he only sees around 40% of the colors. Dávila compared his condition to having a box of chocolates but only being able to eat a sample of the selection. He says he has such a strong desire to see every color. “It's something that I miss in my life, that if somebody says, ‘Look at this flower,’ which is bright, bright pink, I want to do it,” he said. “It's something that comes from my heart so passionately. I can feel the vibration of color.” Colorblindness runs his family. A grandfather and some great uncles only saw in black and white, while his mother and her three sisters also were colorblind even though the condition is rarer in women. His two brothers also have trouble discriminating between colors. Dávila has spent his career in Colombia, New York and Florida. He was awarded the “Order of Democracy” by the Colombian Congress in 1999 for his contribution to the arts. He also has published two hardcover books and many catalogues about his paintings, and his work has appeared at major auctions including Christie’s and Sotheby’s. His paintings include romantic images of men and women embracing and landscapes, often using the color blue as a foundation. “I think color is one of the most important things in life,” he said. “And especially for me.” Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida contributed to this report.",The Independent,The Independent

Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides. Atmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week. The system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said. Roads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors. “It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo. Lopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike. “We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said. Davey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house. “I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.” Arlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged. “It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.” With more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick. “We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.” A falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash. Areas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. More wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance. The state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.

He also acted in Hebrew, including at the Israeli national theatre in Tel Aviv, and appeared in a number of Israeli movies in the 1980s and 1990s. He studied at Tel Aviv University.

Read our Through the decades, downtown Kabul’s Ariana Cinema had weathered revolution and war, emerging battered and bruised but still standing to entertain Afghans with On Dec. 16, demolition crews began to tear down the historic cinema, which first opened its doors to moviegoers in the early 1960s. A week later, there was nothing left. “It's not just a building made of bricks and cement that is being destroyed, but the Afghan cinema lovers who resisted and continued their art despite the hardships and severe security problems,” Afghan film director and actor Amir Shah Talash told The Associated Press. “Unfortunately, all the signs of historical Afghanistan are being destroyed.” Hearing about the Ariana Cinema's destruction was “very painful and sad news for me,” said Talash, who has been active in Afghanistan's film industry since 2004 but has been living in France since the Taliban bans most forms of art and entertainment Afghanistan's Taliban government, which seized power in 2021 in the wake of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops, has imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law which has introduced a raft of restrictions, including bans on most forms of entertainment such as films and music. Shortly after taking over, the new government ordered all cinemas to stop operating. On May 13 this year, it announced the dissolution of the Afghan Film Administration. The Ariana, built on municipal land by a busy traffic roundabout was shuttered and remained in limbo. authorities later decided the cinema, with its stylish marquee and plush red seats, had to make way for a new shopping complex. “Cinemas themselves are a kind of commercial activity, and that area was a completely commercial area and had the potential for a good market there,” Kabul Municipality spokesman Niamatullah Barakzai said. The municipality aims to develop the land it owns “to generate good income from its resources and bring positive changes in the city,” he added. The Ariana Cinema opens in the liberalizing 1960s The Ariana opened in 1963, its sleek architecture mirroring the modernizing spirit the then-ruling monarchy was trying to bring to the deeply traditional nation. But Afghanistan was soon plunged into conflict. The Soviets invaded in 1979, and by the late 1980s war raged across the country, as Soviet-backed President Najibullah’s government fought an American-backed coalition of warlords and Islamic militants. He was toppled in 1992, but a bloody civil war ensued. The Ariana suffered heavy damage and lay in ruins for years. In 1996, the Taliban took over Kabul, and whatever cinemas in the city had survived were shuttered. A new — but temporary — lease of life The Ariana was given a new lease of life after the Taliban’s 2001 ouster by the U.S.-led invasion, with the French government helping to rebuild it in 2004. Indian films were particularly popular, as were action movies, while the Ariana also began playing Afghan movies resulting from a revival of the domestic film industry. For Talash, the film director and actor, it was his childhood visits to the Ariana with his brothers that sparked his interest in movies. “It was from this cinema that I fell in love with film and turned to this art form,” he said. Eventually, one of his own films was screened in the Ariana, “which is one of the unforgettable memories for me.” The cinema was a cultural gathering place for Kabul residents who would go there to “relieve their sorrows and problems and to calm their minds and hearts,” Talash said. “But now, a very important part of Kabul has been taken away. In this new era, we are regressing, which is very sad.” But art, he said, doesn't just reside in buildings. There is still hope. “The future looks difficult, but it is not completely dark,” Talash said. “Buildings may collapse, but art lives on in the minds and hearts of people.” In neighboring Pakistan, authorities imposed heavy taxes on Indian films to curb imports and then banned them outright after the 1965 war between India and Pakistan over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. Bollywood fans from Pakistan would travel to Kabul instead to watch the popular movies. Among them was Sohaib Romi, a Pakistani film enthusiast and art lover, who recalled watching the Indian film “Samjhauta,” or “Compromise,” at the Ariana in 1974 with his uncle. For him, the loss is personal. “My memories are buried in the rubble of the Ariana Cinema,” he said.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our militants in northwestern Nigeria on Thursday marked a major escalation in an offensive that Nigeria's overstretched military has struggled with for years. said on social media that the “powerful and deadly” strikes were carried out against State militants “targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent .” Residents and security analysts have said Nigeria’s security crisis affects both Christians, predominant in the south, and Muslims, who are the majority in the north. Nigeria, which is battling multiple armed groups, said the U.S. strikes were part of an exchange of intelligence and strategic coordination between the two countries. The Associated Press could not confirm the extent of the strikes' impact. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a post on X about the airstrikes, said: “More to come...” The armed groups in Africa’s most populous country include at least two affiliated with the Islamic State — an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) known locally as Lakurawa and prominent in the northwest. Although officials did not say exactly which group was targeted, security analysts said the target, if indeed against Islamic State militants, was likely members of Lakurawa, which became more lethal in border states like Sokoto and Kebbi in the last year, often targeting remote communities and security forces. The Nigerian military has said in the past that the group has roots in neighboring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria's border communities following a 2023 military coup. That coup resulted in fractured relations between Nigeria and Niger, and affected their multinational military operations along the porous border. Militants invited to provide security now torment villages Multiple analysts have said Lakurawa has been active in northwest Nigeria since around 2017 when it was invited by traditional authorities in Sokoto to protect their communities from bandit groups. The militants, however, ""overstayed their welcome, clashing with some of the community leaders ... and enforcing a harsh interpretation of sharia law that alienated much of the rural population,” according to James Barnett, an Africa researcher with the Washington-based Hudson Institute. “Communities now openly say that Lakurawa are more oppressive and dangerous than the bandits they claim to protect them from,"" according to Malik Samuel, a Nigerian security researcher with Good Governance Africa. Lakurawa controls territories in Sokoto and Kebbi states, and has become known for killings, kidnapping, rape and armed robbery, Samuel said. But some of the attacks blamed on Lakurawa are by the Islamic State Sahel Province, which has expanded from Niger’s Dosso region to northwestern Nigeria, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. “ISSP has maintained a low profile, operating covertly to infiltrate and entrench itself along the Niger-Nigeria border, and is now also expanding its operations toward the Beninese border,” the project said in a recent report. The security woes are more of a governance problem than a military one. Motives for attacks differ but the gangs are often driven by the near absence of a state and security presence in conflict hot spots, making recruitment easy. Those hot spots, data show, have some of the country's highest levels of poverty, hunger and lack of jobs. Nigeria’s Minister of Defense Christopher Musa once said in his past capacity as the defense chief that military action is only 30% of what is needed to fix the country's security crisis, while the remaining 70% depends on good governance. “The absence of the state in remote communities is making it easy for non-state actors to come in and present themselves to the people as the best alternative government,” said Samuel. US strikes seen as crucial support for Nigeria's military Thursday's U.S. strikes were seen as crucial help for Nigeria’s security forces, which are often overstretched and outgunned as they fight multiple security crises across different regions. In states like Sokoto, the military often carries out airstrikes targeting militant hideouts and Nigeria has embarked on mass recruitment of security forces. But analysts say military operations targeting the gangs are not usually sustained and the militants easily move on motorcycles to new locations through vast forests that connect several states in the north. They also often use hostages — including schoolchildren — as cover, making airstrikes difficult.",The Independent,The Independent

In fact, the equivalent of annually, with the vast majority of turkey, vegetables, and desserts going to waste on itself. Meanwhile, rotting food in landfills releases harmful greenhouse gases like methane, contributing to climate change. And resources like water, land and energy used to produce wasted food are also lost. In a world of overlapping crises, where food production is struggling to feed a growing population, we need to rethink how and what we eat; our preconceived conceptions of what we throw away, and question why we do so. As Douglas McMaster, founder of the zero-waste restaurant, Silo, says, “waste is a failure of the imagination”. Boxing Day sandwiches and curries are a step in the right direction. Instead of binning vegetable tops and bottoms, mushroom stalks and the like, chuck them into the freezer to be used later for stock, broth or in a curry. Some dogs love snacking on carrots and broccoli stems. Composting is another solution, but not everyone has access to one. And fermenting is another way to get more out of vegetables. So much of what we throw away are valuable sources of carbohydrates, fibre, plant-derived proteins, and nutrients that can improve our immune system. A study published in the suggested that radish leaves contain more nutrients than the commonly used radish roots – improving our gut health, alleviating metabolic diseases and containing anticancer properties. This brings to mind the ultimate festive vegetable: the Brussels sprout. Twenty-five per cent of the annual sprout sales take place in the two weeks before Christmas. During cooking, we systematically and methodically get rid of the stem and outer leaves. Unable to find a statistic for this, I conducted my own home experiment*. A single Brussels sprout weighs 13 grams on average. As part of the ritual deflowering of the sprout, we throw away 3 grams of every sprout. That’s 1125 tonnes of sprouts that immediately end up in the bin straight away, the equivalent of 86,538,462 individual sprouts. These outer brassica leaves have greater resilience and resistance to pests, a natural evolution resulting from protecting their more delicate hearts, and therefore can contain more nutrition. “They have to be unlocked through fermentation or cooking as they can upset some people's stomachs if not, as this is a form of natural defence,” says Ryan Walker, head of research and development and head of fermentation at Silo London. Discarded parts of vegetables go into kimchi and pickles, but the most common use at SILO is using it for make treacle. “It takes the flavours of these ingredients and yields a honey-like syrup from it.” I use the outer leaves of Brussels sprouts, celery leaves, leafy greens of radishes and beetroots in pao chai (a Chinese way of fermenting vegetables in salt brine), kimchi and sauerkraut. Lacto-fermentation transforms the tough textures and breaks it down into something more flavourful, nutrient-dense and digestible. Their tough membrane makes them perfect for kimchi and kraut, withstanding the anaerobic process and holding their structure during fermentation. Anju Patel, shopkeeper-turned-chef whose family runs Londis N16, serves up a range of home-cooked curries, chutneys and samosas through the shop. Their customers come from as far as Croydon, notified about their latest Gujerati creations through their , which has attained a level of cult status. She uses most things, like vegetable stalks or leaves. “They can be used in the same way as you would use spinach,” she says. “So, I’ve used them in rice or you stir them through a dal. I’ve used citrus rinds to make chundo, a sweet, tangy Gujarati pickle. The herb stalks can be blended into chutneys. I’ve [also] taken the tough fibres out of the stems of kale and used a food processor to chop them finely and added them to pakora batter.” Patel grew up in Gangadia, a small village in Gujarat, India, and uses all the parts of vegetables that normally go into the bin: kohlrabi stalks, cauliflower leaves, celery leaves, beetroot leaves, broccoli stalks, herb stalks, the rinds of juiced lemons and limes, and kale stems. “The idea of those things being waste when I was growing up didn’t even cross my mind. The leaves of the cauliflower were a part of the vegetable as much as the florets were, and that’s the same with all the other vegetables. We also didn’t have the refuse systems we’re lucky to have now. Throwing stuff away wasn’t as convenient as it is now.” We all need to realise that fresh is not the only way to eat. Fermenting is an effective way to use up unwanted vegetable bits otherwise destined for the bin. Rebecca Ghim runs The Ferm, specialising in producing fermented foods from commonly discarded food byproducts like cauliflower leaves and beetroot stems - she sources them from restaurants. It was a chance encounter with Ghim at a pickling event that inspired me to use cauliflower leaves and broccoli stems in my kimchi. During this season of goodwill, where excess and gluttony are celebrated, we must also remember to use our imagination. We need to stop unthinkingly throwing away food. Instead, pause to consider how it can be used for other meals. It makes no sense for perfectly edible food and nutrients to go straight into our bins, while we grapple with today's issues and challenges around food production and food poverty. But also, fermenting and pickling and generally repurposing what you might once have seen as waste can be totally delicious.

Over the rest of the year, you can also substitute cold roast chicken or rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. Serve with rice and naan, if you like.” 1. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cardamom pods and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the onion softens. 2. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further minute. 3. Now add the curry powder and tomato purée and cook for 30 seconds. 4. Pour in the tomatoes and stock, stir well, then bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to medium, then simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sauce starts to thicken. 5. Add the turkey, then cover with a lid and simmer for a further 5–10 minutes. 6. Stir through the yoghurt and garam masala, then taste for seasoning and serve, scattered with coriander, if you like. 1. Preheat oven to 190-200C. Add butter to a large pan and wait until sizzling, add onions, leeks, carrots and celery and cook on a medium heat for around 4-6 minutes. Once softened, add garlic and cook for a further 1 minute. Add in your leftover ham and Dijon mustard to form a paste. Then add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. 2. Next, add in your flour to form a roux and cook it out for a couple of minutes. Then add your chicken stock and cream bit by bit until you reach a thick, glossy consistency (a bit thicker than double cream). Finish with some leftover cheese and your shredded turkey. 3. Transfer to your pie dish and make sure it's level and even. 4. Next, cover your filled pie dish with your puff pastry, brush the egg over, season with flaky salt and bake for 30-40 minutes “There’s much debate about the best way to use Christmas leftovers but let’s face it, nothing beats a festive turkey club sandwich washed down with a frosty beer (or maybe two). A close second in our household is the mighty Christmas ragu,” says Padella chef Tim Siadatan. “Slightly dry, fridge-cold turkey meat and stuffing? Perfect. A couple of lonely pigs in blankets? Yes, please (and I’ll take the sludgy fat they’ve set in as well). The one sad sprout destined for the compost – that’ll be our green intake for the day. Oh, and the ‘roast’ potato that didn’t quite make it – stuck in no-man’s land, somewhere between boiled and crisp. And let’s not forget the dregs of gravy that have turned to jelly. There’s no hard-and-fast rule about what to include (though I’d draw the line at bread or cranberry sauce). The key is to lean heavily on the meat, with just a little veg – a sensible ratio is 70 per cent meat to 30 per cent veg.” 1. For the pasta, in a large cooking pot, bring 4-5 litres of water to the boil and add a fistful of salt. Finely chop your cooked meat. Chop the veg and pulses slightly coarser than the meat. 2. Heat the fat or olive oil in a saucepan or flameproof casserole large enough to easily fit all the ingredients, including the cooked pasta. Add the chopped meat and fry over a medium heat until just starting to brown. Add the chopped veg/pulses, stir and continue to fry for 2-3 minutes, stirring often. 3. Add the Marsala and stir for 30 seconds, then add the gravy (or milk). Turn the heat down to a low simmer and cook gently for 5 minutes. Take off the heat, stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper to taste. 4. Drop the pasta into the boiling water and follow the packet directions for timing, but take 2 minutes off the recommended cooking time. 5. Drain the pasta as soon as it’s ready, keeping two mugs of pasta water. Add the pasta to the ragu along with half a mug (about 120ml) of pasta water, the butter and chopped parsley, if using. Stir over a medium heat until the butter is melted, the sauce is smooth and creamy, and the pasta is al dente (firm to bite but easy to chew) and fully coated. If the sauce is too dry, add splashes of water to loosen it as you stir – you want the pasta to be loose and for the strands to slide freely over each other as you stir. 6. Serve on hot plates, finished with grated Parmesan (or other cheese). A peppery, herby green salad dressed in lemon oil sits well alongside. “There is so much that is seemingly wrong about this combination of melted, rich cheese with golden toasted sweet bread, yet – by some kind of alchemy – the two work exceptionally well together,” says cookery writer Skye McAlpine. “Trust me on the addition of mustard: you need a slick of something sharp and peppery to cut through the glorious, greasy, buttery richness of the whole affair (indeed, by the same principle, this would be good with a few cornichons or pickled onions on the side). “Trust me also on the mayonnaise: I know it seems egregious to slather mayo over something as delicately flavoured as a slice of panettone, but you won’t taste it. I promise. The mayonnaise seemingly evaporates into nothingness, but the combination of its constituent parts – eggs and olive oil – paves the way for a perfectly golden exterior on the sandwich. “This makes for a gloriously rich and indulgent breakfast, especially for those who like to start the day with something savoury, but I am also quite partial to a grilled cheese sandwich for supper, with nothing more than a little crisp green salad on the side.” 1. Slice the panettone into 2 evenly (and roughly equal) sized pieces. If it’s a round, crossways section, I like to cut it on the diagonal, so that when sandwiched together, you have a rounded triangular sandwich. 2. Set a non-stick pan over a medium heat and melt the butter. Spread the mayonnaise over 1 side of each of the pieces of panettone. Now turn a slice over so its mayonnaise-coated side is facing downwards and spread with a thin layer of mustard, then top with the grated cheese. Sandwich together with the second slice of panettone, mayonnaise-coated side facing upwards this time, then set in the pan. 3. Fry gently over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until the bread turns golden, then carefully flip the sandwich onto the other side and fry for a further 2–3 minutes, until golden on both sides and the cheese has melted. Serve immediately. “A glorious centrepiece!” says time-saving guru Suzanne Mulholland. “This is a ‘cook ahead’ recipe and some elements are cooked before freezing, but it will need further cooking once out of the fridge/freezer.” 1. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan. Drizzle the squash with olive oil and season well, then roast on a baking tray for 20-25 minutes until golden. 2. Fry the onion and garlic in the remaining oil until soft, add the mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes. 3. Combine the cooked mushrooms and squash in a bowl and leave to cool. 4. Cut the pastry in half and roll out both pieces on a lightly floured surface to a £1 coin thickness. Cut a 23cm circle from one (use a plate as a template) and a 28cm circle from the other. 5. Place the smaller circle onto a parchment-lined baking tray. Add the mushroom and squash, leaving a 2.5cm gap at the edges. Top with the Camembert and the cranberry sauce. 6. Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, then lay the larger pastry circle on top. Press around the edges with a fork. Brush all over with egg and decorate with leftover pastry, cut into shapes. 7. Flash-freeze on the baking tray, then place the pie in a freezer bag. 1. Preheat the air fryer to 180C. Drizzle the squash with olive oil and season well, then place in the basket and cook for 18-20 minutes, shaking halfway. 2. Fry the onion and garlic in the remaining oil until soft, add the mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes. 3. Combine the cooked mushrooms and squash in a bowl and leave to cool. 4. Cut the pastry in half and roll out both pieces on a lightly floured surface to a £1 coin thickness. Cut a 23cm circle from one (use a plate as a template) and a 28cm circle from the other. 5. Place the smaller pastry circle onto a parchment-lined baking tray. Add the mushroom and squash, leaving a 2.5cm gap at the edges. Top with the Camembert and the cranberry sauce. 6. Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, then lay the larger pastry circle on top. Press around the edges with a fork. Brush all over with egg and decorate with leftover pastry, cut into shapes. 7. Flash-freeze on the baking tray, then place the pie in a freezer bag. : Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan. Place the frozen pie on a lined baking tray and cook for 45-55 minutes, covering with foil if it’s browning too quickly. : Preheat the air fryer to 170C and line the basket with baking parchment. Cook the frozen pie for 40-45 minutes, covering with foil if it’s browning too quickly. Follow the method in the “making ahead” section up until the end of step 6. : Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan. Cook on a lined baking tray for 35-40 minutes until golden, covering with foil if it’s browning too quickly. : Preheat the air fryer to 170C and line the basket with baking parchment. Cook for 35-40 minutes until golden, covering with foil if it’s browning too quickly. 1. Preheat the oven to 220C/200C fan/425F/gas mark 7 and line a baking sheet with baking paper. 2. Warm the olive oil in a large frying pan and gently fry the onion with a pinch of salt over a medium heat until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and mixed herbs and fry for a couple more minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and leave to cool to room temperature. 3. Chop the leftovers by hand or pulse in a food processor. Don’t overdo it; the mixture should be rough, not smooth. Season generously with salt and pepper. 4. Transfer the leftovers to the bowl with the onions and add the chipotle paste and crème fraîche. Grate in the butter. Mix well. 5. Lay the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface with a short side closest to you. Fold the top edge down to meet the lower edge and lightly press to make a crease along the centre. Unfold and cut along the crease to make two smaller rectangles. 6. Fold each of the small rectangles in half along the short side. Unfold and cut along the crease to make four rectangles 9 x 23cm. Place a quarter of the filling along a long side of each pastry rectangle. Squeeze the filling as you go so it holds together. Brush the facing long edge with egg, then firmly roll into a log. Press to seal firmly. Repeat with the remaining filling and pastry. 7. Cut each log into four equal pieces and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with egg and sprinkle with nigella seeds. Bake for 25 minutes or until puffed and golden. Serve hot. 1. Make the celeriac rémoulade: Put all the ingredients apart from the celeriac into a bowl and whisk them together. Taste it. Nice, huh?! Now julienne the celeriac with that special peeler you’ve bought and mix the slivers into the sauce as you go, being careful not to julienne yourself. At the end, mix well – I like to use my hands for this one so that I can gently squish everything together. Once mixed, leave for at least one hour, or ideally a few hours, for the flavour to develop and the celeriac to soften. My friend Owen, I believe, salts his celeriac slivers before putting everything together. I never bother! This’ll keep for three days in the refrigerator. 2. Make the sandwich: Butter the bottom of your bread with a heavy hand and pile on the ham in a nice, even layer. 3. Pile on the rémoulade. Lid on, bit of a squish, trim the crusts off and cut the sarnie in half with a serrated knife, back and forth, back and forth, being careful not to squidge the bread. Spread all around the open, now crustless edges of the sandwich with mayo. Sprinkle the chopped parsley onto a little plate or something and dunk the mayo’d edges into it. Sit down, feet up, TV on, enjoy yourself. Have a glass of wine, or two; it’s Boxing Day. 1. Heat the oil or water in a large saucepan placed over a medium heat. When hot, add the leeks and garlic and sauté for three to four minutes until soft. Add the sweetcorn and vegan roast (or veg), stir with a wooden spoon, and cook for a further three minutes. A little caramelisation on the turkey will add a great flavour. Add the seasoning, then pour in the wine or stock, scraping any bits off the bottom to deglaze the pan. Cook for a further three minutes. 2. Stir in the cream and miso paste and simmer gently for 15 minutes – don’t let it boil. After 15 minutes, it should be nice and creamy. Check the seasoning, and add more if needed. Scrape the filling into a 23-centimetre pie dish and leave it to cool for around 25 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 180C. Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out your pastry to around four millimetres thick and wide enough to fit over your pie dish. 4. Carefully transfer the pastry and lay it over the filling, gently pressing around the edges of the pie dish to seal and trim off any overhanging pastry. Pinch the pastry around the edge of the pie dish to create a fluted edge. Get creative with the pastry trimmings – roll out again and cut into festive shapes or letters to decorate your pie, brushing with milk. 5. Mix the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl, then brush the glaze over the pie top and decoration. Bake on the lower shelf of the preheated oven for 30 minutes until the pastry is beautiful and golden. I like to brush over a little more glaze just before serving. judge and chef Prue Leith says: “Few children like Christmas pudding, but I’ve never met one who didn’t like ice cream. About 40 years ago, I started using the leftover Christmas cake or lump of Christmas pudding in a Christmas dessert made mostly of vanilla ice cream. “Now everyone expects this version of Christmas ‘pud’. Some years, the ice cream is flavoured with leftovers, sometimes I just buy a jar of mincemeat and use that. “Sometimes it’s crumbled mince pies. But the essential thing is to get enough of that Christmas flavour – so taste as you mix, and add a bit of powdered cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger, if you need to.” 1. In a large, chilled mixing bowl, combine the softened ice cream with the crumbled leftovers and the brandy. Take care not to over-mix – you want to see nice big pieces of Christmas pudding, or whatever, throughout. 2. Line a large plastic pudding bowl or a large loaf tin with cling film, making sure to leave plenty of overhang so that you can wrap the contents fully. Transfer the mixture into the container, then cover the top and freeze the ‘pudding’ for at least six hours. 3. When it’s time to serve, unwrap the ice-cream pudding or loaf and either turn it out to serve in slices or scoop it from the tin. Tips for success: Before you start, chill the cake or pud that you want to incorporate, and chill the big bowl you are going to mix it in and the small container you are going to freeze it in. Line the smaller bowl or tin with cling film to help you un-mould the ice cream later. Use soft-scoop ice cream, so you can mix without having to melt the ice cream first. It’s better to have patches of plain ice cream than to beat all the air out of the mixture and end up with a rock-hard frozen dessert. You want the result to be two-thirds plain vanilla ice cream and one-third added pudding/cake/mince pies. While Christmas leftovers make great bubble and squeak and turkey curry, sometimes all you have the energy to put together is a really, really good sandwich. This version is fried in a pan and dipped in gravy. 1. Start by assembling your toasted sandwich. Take each slice of sourdough bread and spread the outside of each with mayonnaise. Then fill by spreading a teaspoon of Dijon mustard, followed by the leftover turkey meat. This is a good point to season the toastie with a pinch of Maldon Chilli Sea Salt and some black pepper. 2. Top this with the sliced-up leftover stuffing and pigs in blankets. Then top with slices of Brie. Finally, finish with a generous amount of cranberry sauce, then sandwich the top slice of bread on top. 3. Place a heavy-bottomed pan on medium heat and add the knob of butter. When melted, add your sandwich, then use a heavy weight to press it down. Allow this to cook on one side for approximately three to five minutes before lifting the weight and carefully flipping the sandwich. The other side should be golden and crisp on the bottom. Add the weight back on and cook the other side for the same time. 4. As soon as the toastie is done, remove it from the pan and cut it in half. The cheese should be oozy, and you can serve it with a cornichon and a cocktail stick on top. It is delicious served with warm leftover gravy for dunking. Christmas can be an unforgiving time for your gut. Instead of making your leftover turkey into sandwiches or pies, try transforming it into this vibrant salad. Despite having wheat in the title, “buckwheat” is a seed rather than a grain, making it naturally gluten-free. Buckwheat noodles are higher in protein and fibre than noodles made from wheat or rice. Buckwheat contains both soluble and insoluble fibre. Insoluble fibre helps food move through the gut and soluble fibre is a prebiotic to feed beneficial bacteria. It gets fermented by gut microbes to produce beneficial compounds like butyrate, which can reduce inflammation. If you’re gluten-intolerant, check the packet to ensure your noodles are 100 per cent buckwheat and not blended with wheat. 1. Place the cucumber on a chopping board and bash it a few times with a rolling pin. Split it open lengthways, scoop out most of the seeds with a teaspoon, then cut it diagonally into 1 cm slices. 2. Lightly smack each radish with the rolling pin until they split open. Put the cucumber and radishes into a sieve or colander, sprinkle with salt and leave it to draw out the moisture from the vegetables while you make the dressing. 3. Mix all the dressing ingredients together until smooth. Taste and adjust the ratio of vinegar, soy sauce or chilli oil if needed. 4. Cook the edamame beans and noodles in boiling water according to the packet instructions, ensuring the noodles retain a little bite. Drain and plunge into cold water. Drain well through a colander, then toss with the dressing in a large mixing bowl. 5. Pat-dry the vegetables with a clean tea towel or kitchen paper. Add them to the noodles with the turkey and spring onions. 6. Give everything a final toss, then arrange on a platter and sprinkle with chopped peanuts. : This salad works equally well with thin slices of leftover rare roast beef, or go meat-free by adding an extra handful of edamame beans. If you’re coeliac, use tamari in place of the soy sauce, as some varieties contain wheat. 2. In a large jug, mix your eggs, milk and cream, seasoning and dried herbs. 3. In the quiche case, spread out your chopped-up leftovers and half your cheese. 4. Gently pour over your egg mixed, making sure it's evenly distributed. 5. Finish with the other half of your cheese and bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden and set. 6. Let the quiche cool for at least 20 minutes before serving. 7. Serve with some cranberry sauce and salad. 1. Using a masher in a large bowl, mash up the leftover vegetables and roast potatoes. 2. Add your stuffing by crumbled or having nice small lumps throughout the mix. 3. Next, shred or chop your leftover meat and add it to the mix, it should be coarse. 5. Add the beaten egg and mix, then add in flour until it all holds its shape when pressed. 6. Press them into burger-shaped pucks and lightly flour both sides. 7. To cook them heat 1 tablespoon of butter or vegetable in a frying pan to a medium high heat and evenly cook on both sides for around 3 minutes a side (try not to move them too much to avoid breakage) can do this in batches and transfer to a baking tray to finish in the oven at 180C for around 8-10 minutes. 8. Serve with poached or fried eggs and a slab of cranberry sauce. Place the slices of bread in a dish and pour over the milk and set to one side. Peel and finely chop the garlic and shallot and finely chop the parsley. Heat a pan with a small amount of oil over a medium heat and fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Add the soaked bread, onion and garlic mixture, parsley and cooked turkey with a pinch of salt and pepper to a food processor and blend until almost smooth. Crack the egg into a shallow bowl and mix well. Add the remaining flour to a plate and season with salt and pepper, then add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate. Remove 1/6th of the mixture at a time and form into a rough nugget shape. Coat each nugget in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press it into the breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over. Heat a wide non-stick frying pan (with a matching lid) with 1 inch of vegetable oil. Fry the nuggets for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown and crisp. Remove from the oil and drain on a cooling rack over kitchen roll. Alternatively, you can place them on a baking tray with a drizzle of oil and bake in an oven preheated to 200C/180 fan/gas 6 for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C (fan)/gas 6. Boil a full kettle. Add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat. Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and allow to steam. While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely dice your brown onion. Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic. Cut your red chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely. Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the diced onion, chopped garlic, and half the chopped chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until softened. Meanwhile, trim the ends from your Brussels sprouts, then finely slice. Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, garam masala and a splash of water and cook for 1 min. Add the sliced Brussels sprouts to the pan with a knob of butter and cook for 7-8 minutes further or until softened. While the sprouts are softening, grate your cheddar cheese and chop the coriander finely, including the stalks. Once softened, add your mango chutney, grated cheese and half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!). Season with a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your Brussels sprout & garam masala tart filling. Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour. Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approximately 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut into 1 square per person. Transfer the pastry square to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and score a 1cm border around the edge of the pastry with a knife. Top the centre of the pastry square with the Brussels sprout & garam masala tart filling. Add the drained potatoes to a baking tray and crush gently. Add a drizzle of olive oil, your nigella seeds and a generous pinch of salt – these are your nigella smashed potatoes. Put the Brussels sprout and garam masala tarts and nigella smashed potatoes in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden and cooked through and the potatoes are caramelised. Wash your lamb’s lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper. Serve the Brussels sprout and garam masala tart with the nigella smashed potatoes and lamb’s lettuce to the side. Add a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of pepper to the lamb’s lettuce. Top the tart with the remaining chopped coriander and chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!).",The Independent,The Independent

A ramble is a fine thing in itself, providing untold health benefits for both body and mind. But many would argue that a at the end of it. What could be better than a table by a fireplace, a pub classic meal and a cold pint after a lengthy stroll through the countryside? With that in mind, here are 12 routes for a walk across the UK countryside, from , and, of course, where to stop for a quick pick-me-up before heading home. There are few sights as quintessentially “English” as the Seven Sisters – the undulating succession of chalk cliffs facing out into the Channel. Start at Birling Gap then take the coast path west, passing across the clifftops before turning inland to follow the winding River Cuckmere. Turn right again at Westdean and follow the public footpaths towards Friston and East Dean. Be sure to stop at the latter for a drink at the , a 15th-century tavern serving real ales and hearty grub, before walking the last mile back to the starting point. The Tiger Inn also offers rooms, double and twin, with an en-suite and breakfast included. Starting from Ribblehead train station, follow the trackside footpath northwest – almost immediately, you’ll see the elegant arches of the Ribblehead Viaduct on your left. Keep going until the path eventually crosses the railway line. A short way beyond the crossing, you’ll come to Force Gill waterfall. The route then wends its way around Whernside before turning sharply uphill for the summit – one of the highest in the Dales. It’s a steep climb but worth it for the sweeping views. Descend back towards the starting point, with a short detour to the to find fine views and fresh(ish) air. The Thames Path is a rich and rewarding journey through the heart of the capital. The section along the southern bank from Battersea Park to Kew Gardens is undoubtedly one of the prettier stretches, passing through inner-city woodlands and wetlands, past parks and boat clubs, cricket pitches and tennis courts while the river slips by. Upon reaching Kew, it’s just a short hop down to , a smart gastropub with a metropolitan menu and a strong selection of wines, beers and cocktails. This brisk and breezy walk on the north coast can be challenging underfoot, since much of it is shingle. But those who persevere may well be rewarded with an up-close view of the ’s largest seal colony. From the National Trust car park at Cley, follow the beach west for two miles, then turn left when you come to the grassy dunes. Follow this path until you reach the Old Lifeboat House, then turn right along the boardwalk. From here at other times of the year, you may be able to spot the seals – they come here to breed between late October and mid-January. Be sure to keep a safe distance and keep dogs tightly leashed. Retrace your footsteps to the car park, then make the short trip into Cley, where you’ll find good gastropub fare and a convivial atmosphere at Stays at The George & Dragon include en-suite boutique hotel rooms, with breakfast included. The pub’s coach house also offers two self-contained flats. follows a craggy route along the sides of the largest gorge in . Head up Cufic Lane, opposite the visitor information centre, then turn right onto the footpath. The route is well-signposted with waymarkers, so it should be easy to follow. Continue along the northern clifftop – there are views of the Levels and Glastonbury Tor on a clear day – until you reach the road at Black Rock Nature Reserve. Cross over, and follow the arrows along the gorge’s southern flank back towards Cheddar. From the visitor centre, it’s a 10-minute walk into the town centre, where you’ll find the , a gastropub beside the Cheddar Yeo river. The Gower Peninsula is sorely underrated outside of South . It was the UK’s first AONB, and any stretch of its 39-mile coastline is worthy of exploration. One of the best bits is the path from Port Eynon to Oxwich as it’s beautiful and relatively easygoing. Walk through the nature reserve into Oxwich village, then head back to where you started via the inland route, passing the impressive castle (really just a grand house with military pretensions, and also sadly closed this time of year). Once in Port Eynon again, grab a table at the , an old smugglers’ haunt with strong local ales on tap. starts in the honeypot village of Bourton-on-the-Water. From there, follow the River Windrush through gently rolling hills towards Naunton (pause to admire the wonderful 17th-century dovecote) before turning east towards the River Eye. Turn right at the river and follow it down through Upper Slaughter and onward to Lower Slaughter. From there, it’s another half-hour walk back to Bourton, where you’ll find The , a warm and welcoming venue offering cask ales and strong cider alongside a menu of pub classics. ’s imposing Norman fortress, head down to the coast path and turn left, going past the lighthouse and the Newtown Gun Emplacement, with the Farne Islands visible out to sea. Skirt the edge of Budle Bay until you reach the pretty little hamlet of Waren Mill. You can then return the way you came, or cut inland, passing the as you head back into Bamburgh. Stop in at the before heading for home – it’s been providing bed and board to weary travellers for more than 850 years. Making the lung-busting ascent up Arthur’s Seat is not for the faint-hearted – it’s a steep 251m climb to the summit. Still, for many in it offers a favourite outdoor jaunt in the heart of the city. The best place to start is the entrance near . Go past St Margaret’s Well and bear left at the fork. Follow the path to the hill’s peak, admire the views, then descend via the zig-zagging steps. If you can, it’s worth making a detour down towards Duddingston, where you’ll find at the foot of the slope. It’s an inviting country-style pub with a convivial atmosphere and, most unusually, its very own skittle alley. This trail partly follows the southern shoreline of Strangford Lough, the largest sea inlet in the British Isles and a good place for birdwatching. Start at the Shore Car Park and follow the path, keeping the water to your right. Almost immediately, you’ll pass Old Castle Ward, which fans of HBO’s may recognise as Winterfell Castle. The path curves inland shortly after passing another historic monument, Audley’s Castle. Follow it past the ornamental canal, then either cut across the parkland back to the car park or continue following the boundary path to extend the walk. For a glass of something medicinal, and perhaps a bite to eat, head into nearby Strangford and grab a table in The Cuan has individually designed rooms with single and king-sized beds. Extra single beds can be brought into double rooms to accommodate families. treads through a Welsh wildlife haven from Mora Nefyn car park. Head down onto the sand to follow the beach past unfinished sea defences and sand martin nests until you reach the hamlet of Porthdinllaen. Here, walkers can reward themselves with a local brew mid-coastal stroll at the – accessible only via foot for non-residents. Carry on around the seagrass-studded headland past the lifeboat station onto the golf course for views across the bay before you loop back to the car park. Clocking in at 15.5 miles long, this trail to the most remote pub on mainland Britain is one for the serious steppers and ultimate pub enthusiasts. The route from Kinloch Hourn to The is a one-way hike on the edge of the Knoydart Peninsula that committed pint sinkers can complete over one or two days. Climb the gravel path past Loch Hourn to Barrisdale Bay with views of Ladhar Bheinn mountain and pitch up for a deserved picnic before ascending to Mam Barrisdale.

Read our is being remembered for heroically springing into action to save a woman from a sexual assault years ago. Ransone, best known for playing Ziggy Sobotka on the celebrated crime drama, died last week by suicide. He was 46. Following his tragic and untimely death, a woman by the name of Molly Watts paid her respects on social media. “I’m usually private but I want to publicly say I am so grateful that this man existed and don’t know if the trajectory of my life would be the same if he hadn’t,” she wrote, alongside a picture of the actor. Watts explained that they were once neighbors in New York City’s Chinatown — “friendly, overlapping social circles.” “I was attacked at the threshold of our building. I screamed for help. No one came. My attacker put his hands around my throat so I would stop making noise. I couldn’t breathe. I remember the certainty that I was going to die or be raped as I was choked unconscious,” she recalled. “PJ heard my screams and ran to help. He came running shirtless, carrying a bat or pipe — I’m not sure which, because I never saw him in action. He scared my attacker, who ran. PJ chased him to the building he fled to. Because of the chase, the police were able to identify him, a repeat sexual offender,” Watts added. “PJ saved me. I’m not sure if I would have the same life if he hadn’t run down that night,” she continued, sharing a link to a page supporting Ransone’s wife, Jamie, and their two young children. “What’s especially hard for me with PJ’s passing is that he lived with that kind of violence. What I was spared, he endured in a different form, at an age where there is no emotional defense, and the self is still forming,” she wrote. “I get the sense that PJ’s life was haunted by what happened to him then. This world is rarely gentle to people who are hurt, vulnerable, acting out.” New subscribers only. £9.99/mo. after free trial. Plan auto-renews until cancelled. ADVERTISEMENT.

He shared the allegations on his social media accounts after the Baltimore County police conducted an investigation and declined to pursue charges against the teacher. “Over the years, I have thought of PJ from time to time,” Watts admitted. “I wanted to reach out to him to let him know how grateful I was that he ran towards my screams. I didn’t. I regret that.” Before his death, Ransone wrote on his personal website, poignantly reflecting on fatherhood. “Fatherhood cracked me wide open,” he said. “It made me see myself with a level of honesty I’d been avoiding.

Read our was convicted Friday following a corruption trial tied to multibillion-dollar looting of the 1MDB state investment fund. found Najib, 72, guilty on three counts of abuse of power. Rulings on additional charges were still being delivered Friday afternoon. Authorities said he siphoned more than $700 million into his personal bank accounts from the 1MDB fund. Najib, who served as prime minister from 2009 to 2018, currently is serving a prison sentence after being convicted in an earlier case linked to the 1MDB scandal, which led to his government’s defeat in 2018. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2020 for abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering involving 42 million ringgit ($10.3 million) channeled into his accounts from SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB. He began his sentence in August 2022 after losing a final appeal, becoming Malaysia’s first former leader to be jailed. The Pardons Board, a body that advises rulers on granting clemency, halved his sentence and sharply reduced his fine in 2024. Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after taking office in 2009. He had chaired 1MDB’s advisory board and held veto power as finance minister while serving as prime minister. The corruption case rippled across global markets and triggered investigations in the United States and other nations. Between 2009 and 2014, top executives and associates of Najib looted over $4.5 billion from the fund, laundering it through countries including the U.S., Singapore and Switzerland, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Authorities alleged the funds were used to finance Hollywood films and extravagant purchases including hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewelry. , the U.S. attorney general at the time, called it “kleptocracy at its worst.” facing billions in fines for its role in raising money for 1MDB. The scion of a prominent political family, Najib was long seen as untouchable until public anger over 1MDB led to the 2018 election defeat of his ruling party, which had governed Malaysia since the country gained independence from Britain in 1957. Najib denied any wrongdoing. He maintained the funds were a donation from Saudi Arabia and he had been misled by rogue financiers led by Low Taek Jho. He also contended the prosecution was politically motivated. Low, thought to be the scandal’s mastermind, remains at large. Prosecutors have argued Najib was the central decision-maker and ultimate beneficiary of the scheme and Low and other former 1MDB officials were merely “messengers” carrying out his bidding. Earlier this week, Najib failed in his bid to serve his graft sentence under house arrest. Malaysia’s High Court ruled Monday that a rare royal order for home arrest issued by the nation’s former king was invalid because it was not made in accordance with constitutional requirements. Najib’s lawyer has said they plan to appeal. Originally due for release in August 2028 after his sentence reduction, Najib now faces a longer stretch behind bars. Najib’s wife, Rosmah Mansor, also was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a massive fine in 2022 in a separate graft case.

Read our The painstaking process of recataloguing and repackaging tens of thousands of historical artefacts is under way at Northern Ireland’s archaeological storehouse. The state-of-the-art, climate-controlled facility in Co Antrim has recently undergone a major refit to double its capacity. Only a small proportion of items recovered from archaeology digs in Northern Ireland ever make it into museums for public display, with the rest preserved and stored elsewhere. Those used to be housed in various buildings across the region until Stormont’s Historic Environment Division (HED) invested in the centralised store. The facility is full of rare artefacts, from flint spearheads to a seven-metre, 4,000-year-old log boat found near the River Bann. Many of the items were unearthed decades ago, when cataloguing and storing practices were very different from modern day standards. based at the store are now working to address these issues after a new set of guidelines for preserving artefacts was introduced earlier this year. One of the experts involved in the project is curatorial archaeologist Sapphire Mussen. Ms Mussen said standards for artefact care in Northern Ireland were previously not as high as those implemented in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. “The standards of practice naturally do change with time and unfortunately we’ve fallen behind a little bit here,” she said. “We’re no longer in line with other jurisdictions, but we have made massive strides to change that. “We have published a suite of standards and guidance for the creation and care of archaeological archives in Northern Ireland and what that means is from 2025 onwards all new excavation archives that are generated in the field must meet a certain standard for long-term archive storage and preservation. “The legacy archives, which is what we have here (in the Co Antrim store), so anything pre-dating 2025, may not be up to that standard, but we are taking opportunities to improve the collections’ care – improving things like packaging, the labelling, just to improve how they’re housed.” The store is accessible to archaeological researchers who can apply to HED to examine artefacts. They are allowed to perform certain tests on the items, such as carbon dating. The team in the facility is aligning its work programme with those research applications, prioritising the artefacts that are of interest to archaeologists and other academics. Ms Mussen said researchers from around the world have sought access to the storehouse. “The success in what we do, I think, is measured by seeing those researchers come in and seeing the collections be used in a meaningful way,” she said. and the south of Ireland, people from all over.

Their assets in the East Asian country have also been frozen. The announcement of the U.S. arms-sale package, valued at more than $10 billion, has drawn an angry response from China, which claims Taiwan as its own and says it must come under its control. If approved by the American Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to the self-ruled territory. “We stress once again that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China－U.S. relations,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. “Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing."" The ministry also urged the U.S. to stop what it called “the dangerous moves of arming Taiwan.” Taiwan is a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations that analysts worry could explode into military conflict between the two powers.

The US military targeted Islamic State militants in northwestern Nigeria in a major escalation. Nigeria's overstretched military has struggled to contain Islamic terrorism for years. The strikes were carried out in the strikes in Sokoto state, one of the areas where Nigeria is battling multiple armed groups. Lagos said the US strikes were part of an exchange of intelligence and strategic coordination between the two countries. Officials did not say exactly which group was targeted, but security analysts said the target was likely members of a militant group called Lakurawa, which became more lethal in border states like Sokoto and Kebbi in the last year, often targeting remote communities and security forces. Trump said the strikes were against Islamic State militants he claimed were ""targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians."" The security crisis in Nigeria is affecting both Christians, predominant in the south, and Muslims, who are the majority in the north, residents and security analysts told The armed groups in Nigeria include two affiliated with the Islamic State. They include an offshoot of the Boko Haram group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and in the northwest, the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) known locally as Lakurawa. Lakurawa militants, who have been active in northwest Nigeria since around 2017 after being invited by authorities in Sokoto to protect against bandit groups, have now ""overstayed their welcome, clashing with some of the community leaders ... and enforcing a harsh interpretation of sharia law that alienated much of the rural population,"" says James Barnett, an Africa researcher with the Washington-based Hudson Institute. The strikes come after months of accusations from Maga figures in the US that a genocide against Christians was taking place in Nigeria. Trump threatened earlier this year that he would stop US aid to Nigeria and send in US troops “guns-a-blazing” if it “continues to allow the killing of Christians”. Even rapper Nicki Minaj came out in support of defending Christians in Nigeria, when she said: ""In Nigeria, Christians are being targeted. Churches have been burned, families have been torn apart... simply because of how they pray."" But the Nigerian government pushed back against claims, describing them as ""a gross misrepresentation of reality"".

Read our and the family-filled chaos of the day itself, can feel like a welcome relief of proper rest, more festive films and, most importantly, making your way through the ample leftovers of food. , even if they have the day off, are still likely to be cooking on Christmas Day for their families, so a low-effort Boxing Day is in order. From turkey and potatoes to Brussels sprouts and gravy, here’s what top chefs and cookery writers like to create with festive leftovers. “We tend to have a walk on Boxing Day, quite a long walk, over Bodmin Moor and find a pub somewhere, have a couple of pints and go home and just have a late afternoon, early evening dinner. Quite a few other people come around and then we sort of collapse and watch TV,” says “Boxing day for me is leftover turkey, leftover ham, baked potatoes with lots of butter, winter salad, cabbage salad with sort of beetroot in it, celery, nuts, apple, cabbage and some mayo, sort of slightly coleslaw thing, and lots and lots of condiments; chutneys and pickles, and so when I get, like, I don’t know, 10 jars of stuff out of the fridge and the cupboard to serve with it. You have it cold except the baked potatoes. “That’s almost as enjoyable as Christmas lunch or dinner,” says the 78-year-old,  who also enjoys making bubble and squeak cakes – “which I find delicious” – or a Mexican taco. “You use the turkey, chop it and reheat it, then put various Mexican flavours like coriander, raw onion, tomato, chilli, smoky pepper, chipotle, maybe some cream, then you make a fresh slow-cooked taco with it.” “We’re all about the leftovers,” says Donal Skehan. “We have St Stephen’s Day in Ireland – it’s very much the same vibe. It’s the hangover after Christmas. “You want something that’s different after having such traditional food the day before. I do a lovely turkey banh mi I borrow from cuisine. I love those fabulous crusty baguette sandwiches with paté and pickled vegetables and then you can stuff it with leftover turkey, leftover ham, and it’s absolutely gorgeous. “If you’re still in the indulgence mode, I do a lovely mac and cheese, extra-gorgeous because you can fold through the contents of the leftovers of your cheese board, and you can add ham, you can add turkey, whatever you fancy. “To be perfectly honest, I tend to kind of go towards fresh flavours and a lot of Asian ingredients. I love those crispy, crunchy salads with the leftover scraps.” “Christmas day in our family, we are always very well-dressed, in our Sunday best. And we do a proper, traditional sort of day. There’s no sort of lying about in pyjamas – so Boxing Day is the ultimate lying about in PJs, usually getting a lovely loaf of white bread and getting to put leftovers on it. It’s very relaxed compared to Christmas day. I absolutely love it,” says Mulholland. “What I do try to say is only buy what you need. So I only buy enough for Christmas day and one day’s worth of leftovers. If you’ve bought a big turkey, you then have to process the leftovers after Christmas. You’re just adding more stress. So instead, have that extra bit so you’ve just got enough for the leftovers that you actually want. “I love doing things like macaroni cheese and putting stuffing and the turkey through it. It’s a really comforting dish. “I quite often make sausage rolls with anything that I’ve got left over, because a bit of puff pastry, that’s all you need to make it into something else. Or a pie. “A bit of turkey, a bit of ham, put all your veggies in there as well, and you just really need a spot of milk and some creme fresh and a bit of pastry, and you’ve made it into a Boxing Day pie.” “I cook Christmas Day, I’m cooking this Christmas day,” says . “I’m at home cooking, I’ve got my family around, but Boxing Day really is a time we kind of chill out as chefs. I think we’ve done our bit, it’s somebody else’s turn now.” So what does the ITV Saturday Morning star rustle up on Boxing Day? “Toasties are my thing – I’m just obsessed with toasties at the moment. I want them to come back. Toasties used to be really popular in the Seventies and Eighties. “We’ve got bloody air fryers. The toastie machine, I want to be the new air fryer. It’s bloody great. “Caramelised onions and a bit of stuffing, on a bit of beef with some cheese. You put it in a toastie with sliced roast beef or stuff like that. But I bloody love it.” This Morning’s resident chef Clodagh McKenna says: “I love a Christmas sandwich on Boxing Day; turkey, crispy cos lettuce, I get my cranberry sauce, and I mix it with the mayonnaise and put that on top. I put stuffing on there, tomato. “Usually, if we have a bigger crowd around and we’re all out walking that day so it’s more of a kind of a supper thing. “I’ll make a turkey curry, and I’ll make it with butternut squash in it and a coconut base which is really yummy. Or if I’ve cooked a ham, I do love a ham pie, which can be really delicious as well.” “Boxing Day, for me, is Christmas without the chaos,” says Jon Watts. “All the good bits stay, the food, the family, the slow morning, but the pressure melts away. It feels like the first proper exhale after the big day, and it is also when my head naturally starts drifting toward the New Year and what is coming next. “I always spend it with family, usually still eating and drinking our way through the day. People assume I take a break from cooking, but that never really happens. I love the rhythm of it too much. The actual break comes a day or two later when I finally realise I have become 40 per cent gravy! “Leftovers are the whole point of Boxing Day in my house. Turkey is my non-negotiable, and my absolute comfort move is the simplest one, thick slices of turkey tucked into soft bread with butter and a pinch of salt. It is a small tradition that never gets old. But turkey is incredibly versatile, so I like pushing it in different directions. It is brilliant in a creamy casserole or folded into a proper pie with leeks and tarragon. One of my favourites is throwing it into a quick curry with coconut milk, tomatoes, and whatever veg is hanging about. I also love using leftover pigs in blankets as the base of a hearty hash, or stirring chopped stuffing into an omelette, trust me, it works.”",The Independent,The Independent

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/throat-cancer-symptoms-tea-coffee-b2890662.html,Hot drinks have been linked to one type of cancer. Here’s what to know,2025-12-26T12:26:53.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our , do you ask for it to be “extra hot”? Whether you enjoy tea, coffee or something else, hot drinks are a comforting and often highly personal ritual. The exact temperature to brew tea or serve coffee for the best flavour is hotly debated. But there may be something else you’re not considering: your health. Yes, hot drinks can be too hot – and are even linked to cancer. So, let’s take a look at the evidence. There is no evidence for a link between hot drinks and and the evidence for a link between hot drinks and is unclear. But there is a link between hot drinks and cancers of the “food pipe” or oesophagus. In 2016, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified drinking very hot beverages, meaning above 65°C, as “probably carcinogenic to humans” – this is the same risk category as emissions from indoor wood smoke or eating a lot of red meat. The agency’s report found it was the temperature, not the drinks, that were responsible. , where studies found a link between drinking a lot of maté – a traditional herbal drink usually drunk at around 70°C – and a higher risk of oesophageal cancer. Similar studies in the Middle East, Africa and Asia have also supported the link between drinking very hot beverages and developing oesophageal cancer. However, until recently, we didn’t have substantial research exploring this link in Europe and other Western populations. This year, a large study of almost half a million adults in the confirmed that drinking higher amounts of very hot drinks (tea and coffee) was associated with oesophageal cancer. Vincent Ho is an Associate Professor and Clinical Academic Gastroenterologist at Western Sydney University. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence. Read the The study found that someone who drank eight or more cups a day of very hot tea or coffee was almost six times more likely to develop oesophageal cancer, compared to someone who didn’t drink hot drinks. Drinking a lot of very hot drinks can damage cells in the oesophagus lining, and it’s believed over time this can lead to cancer developing. Researchers first proposed this link almost 90 years ago. What we know about how hot drinks can damage the oesophagus mainly comes from animal studies. Very hot water may accelerate cancer growth. One animal study from 2016 studied mice that were prone to developing cancer. Mice given very hot water (70°C) were more likely to develop precancerous growths in the oesophagus, and sooner, compared to mice given water at lower temperatures. Another theory is that heat damage to the oesophagus lining weakens its normal barrier, increasing the risk of further damage from gastric acid reflux (from the stomach). Over time, this chronic damage can increase the chance of oesophageal cancer developing. The risk of cancer may depend on how much hot liquid you drink in one sitting and how quickly. It seems drinking a lot in one go is more likely to damage the oesophagus by causing a heat injury. In one study, researchers measured the temperature inside the oesophagus of people drinking hot coffee at different temperatures. Oesophageal cancer can affect your digestion, such as: They found the size of the sip the person took had more impact than how hot the drink was. A very big sip (20 millilitres) of 65°C coffee increased the temperature inside the oesophagus by up to 12°C. Over time, large sips can lead to sustained heat injury that can damage cells. The occasional small sip of coffee at 65°C isn’t likely to result in any long-term problems. But over years, drinking large amounts of very hot drinks could very well increase the risk of oesophageal cancer. The brewing temperatures for drinks such as coffee are very high – often close to the boiling point of water. For example, takeaway hot drinks may be sometimes be served at very high temperatures (around 90°C) to allow for cooling when people drink them later at the office or home. One study from the United States calculated the ideal temperature for coffee, factoring in the risk of heat injury to the oesophagus while preserving flavour and taste. The researchers came up with an optimum temperature of 57.8°C. Allowing time for a very hot drink to cool is important and research has shown a hot drink’s temperature can drop by 10–15°C in five minutes. Other things that may help cool a hot drink: Finally, small sips are a good idea to test the temperature, given that we know having a large amount has a significant impact on the temperature inside the oesophagus and potential damage to its lining.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/popcorn-lung-vaping-symptoms-diacetyl-b2890665.html,What is popcorn lung? The serious and irreversible disease linked to vaping,2025-12-26T12:38:44.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our teenager was recently reported to have developed the oddly named medical condition “popcorn lung” after Officially known as bronchiolitis obliterans, popcorn lung is a rare but serious and irreversible disease that damages the tiny airways in the , leading to persistent coughing, wheezing, fatigue and breathlessness. The term “popcorn lung” dates back to the early 2000s when several workers at a microwave popcorn factory developed lung problems after inhaling a chemical called diacetyl – the same ingredient used to give popcorn its rich, buttery taste. Diacetyl, or 2,3-butanedione, is a flavouring agent that becomes a toxic inhalant when aerosolised. It causes inflammation and scarring in the bronchioles (the smallest branches of the lungs), making it increasingly difficult for air to move through. The result: permanent, often disabling lung damage. in the EU and UK, but not in the US and other jurisdictions. And illegal vapes that may not comply with regulations are common. Popcorn lung can also be triggered by inhaling other toxic chemicals, including volatile carbonyls like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde – both of which have also been detected in e-cigarette vapours. The scariest part? There’s no cure for popcorn lung. Once the lungs are damaged, treatment is limited to managing symptoms. This can include bronchodilators, steroids, and in extreme cases, lung transplantation. For this reason, prevention – not treatment – is the best and only defence. And yet, for young vapers, prevention isn’t so straightforward. Vaping is especially popular among teenagers and young adults, possibly due to the thousands of flavoured vape products available – from bubblegum to cotton candy to mango ice. But those fruity, candy-like flavours come with a chemical cost. E-liquids may contain nicotine, but they also include a chemical cocktail designed to appeal to users. Many of these flavouring agents are approved for use in food. That doesn’t mean they’re safe to inhale. Here’s why that matters: when chemicals are eaten, they go through the digestive system and are processed by the liver before entering the bloodstream. That journey reduces their potential harm. But when chemicals are inhaled, they bypass this filtration system entirely. They go straight into the lungs – and from there, directly into the bloodstream, reaching vital organs like the heart and brain within seconds. That’s what made the original popcorn factory cases so tragic. Eating butter-flavoured popcorn? Totally fine. Breathing in the buttery chemical? Devastating. Donal O'Shea is a Professor of Chemistry at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences. Gerry McElvaney is a Professor of Medicine at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences. With vaping, the situation is even murkier. Diacetyl is not found in all vapes, but its substitutes – acetoin and 2,3-pentanedione – may be just as harmful. Experts estimate there are over 180 different flavouring agents used in e-cigarette products today. When heated, many of these chemicals break down into new compounds – some of which have never been tested for inhalation safety. That’s a major concern. Though the exact risks aren’t known, there have been medically documented cases of popcorn lung linked to vaping. Because vapers’ lungs are exposed to so many chemicals, it’s not possible to directly prove that diacetyl is the cause of the disease in any specific case. But that doesn’t negate the proven risks of inhaling it. Even if diacetyl isn’t the sole culprit, cumulative exposure to multiple chemicals and their byproducts could increase the risk of popcorn lung and other respiratory conditions. This was tragically echoed in the story of the American teen who developed the disease. Her case is reminiscent of the 2019 Evali crisis (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury), which saw 68 deaths and over 2,800 hospitalisations in the US. That outbreak was eventually linked to vitamin E acetate – a thickening agent in some cannabis vape products. When heated, it produces a highly toxic gas called ketene. More recent studies are raising alarm bells about vaping’s impact on young people’s respiratory health. A multi-national study found that adolescents who vape report significantly more respiratory symptoms, even when adjusting for smoking status. Certain flavour types, nicotine salts, and frequency of use were all linked to these symptoms. It’s clear that history is repeating itself. Just as workplace safety rules were overhauled to protect popcorn factory workers, we now need similar regulatory urgency for the vaping industry – especially when it comes to protecting the next generation. Popcorn and vaping might seem worlds apart, but they’re connected by a common thread: exposure to inhaled chemicals that were never meant for the lungs. The danger lies not in what these chemicals are when eaten, but in what they become when heated and inhaled. If we apply the lessons from industrial safety to today’s vaping habits – particularly among young people – we could avoid repeating the same mistakes. Regulations, clear labelling, stricter ingredient testing, and educational campaigns can help minimise the risks. Until then, stories like that of the American teen serve as powerful reminders that vaping, despite its fruity flavours and sleek designs, is not without consequence. Sometimes, what seems harmless can leave damage that lasts a lifetime.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our is a beloved tradition for many of us during the festive season. While some people prefer using and reusing an artificial tree as an environmentally friendly way to enjoy the holiday spirit, others hunt instead for the perfect real tree to adorn with ornaments and cluster presents around. But some people who decide to get a real tree may find that after it has been decorated they begin to experience cold-like symptoms. While many may simply chalk these symptoms up to having caught a cold – or even – the culprit may actually be a little-known condition called Christmas tree syndrome. Christmas tree syndrome encompasses a spectrum of health issues triggered by exposure to the allergens residing on live Christmas trees. For those who are sensitive to allergens, prolonged exposure to live Christmas trees can lead to respiratory and skin health issues. The main symptoms of Christmas tree syndrome include a stuffy or , sneezing, irritated eyes, coughing, wheezing and itchy throat. may also worsen. Skin-related symptoms may include redness, swelling, and itching. This phenomenon happens thanks to the ecology of live trees, which carry microscopic entities – including pollen and fungi. Pollen, a notorious outdoor allergen, may hitch a ride into our homes, while fungi find a cosy haven in cold, damp Christmas tree farms and garden centres. Live Christmas trees can also carry mould. Notably, a single Christmas tree can host more than 50 species of mould, creating a habitat for these tiny yet potentially troublesome organisms. Many of the mould varieties found on trees are those most likely to trigger allergies, including Researchers have also closely measured mould counts in rooms containing live Christmas trees. During the first three days the tree is indoors, mould spore counts measure about 800 spores per cubic meter of air. On the fourth day, however, spore counts begin rising – eventually reaching 5,000 spores per cubic meter within two weeks. Mould grows best in warm, wet and humid conditions. So when the tree is brought indoors, the warmer climate significantly increases mould production. Samuel J. White is a Senior Lecturer in Genetic Immunology at Nottingham Trent University. Philippe B. Wilson is Professor of One Health at Nottingham Trent University. Pine pollen is not a major issue for allergy-sufferers when it comes to Christmas trees. But Christmas trees can come into contact with other known allergens while they’re growing, which can then be carried into the house. For example, grass pollen can stick to the sap in a Christmas tree during the spring. Then, when the tree is harvested and brought indoors, the sap dries out, and the trapped pollen particles are released into the air. Certain people are at higher risk of experiencing Christmas tree syndrome. People with asthma or may be more sensitive to allergens – and these allergens may also exacerbate symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. People who suffer from allergies are also at greater risk – with research showing 7% of allergy-sufferers experienced a spike in symptoms when they had a Christmas tree in their home. People with skin issues (such as contact dermatitis and itching) may also find that their symptoms worsen around fresh Christmas trees. Timely recognition of symptoms is crucial to mitigate the impact of Christmas tree syndrome. So if you do suffer from allergies, here’s what you can do: Christmas tree syndrome can be a nuisance. But by considering the science and taking precautions, you can ensure an enjoyable and allergen-free festive season.",The Independent,The Independent

It was known that the Mogou ceremonially consumed rice wine brewed this way, but it had rarely been found. “Recent research has highlighted the widespread presence and use of cereal-based fermented beverages in Neolithic China. However studies focusing on early Bronze Age cultures remain limited,” according to a new study published in the Researchers found pottery showing evidence of alcohol fermented using the method and consumed ritually at a Mogou burial site in China’s Gansu province sometime between 1700 and 1100BC. The burials spanned two ancient cultural periods, the Qijia from 2300 to 1500BC and the Siwa from 1400 to 1100BC. Some of these burials had side chambers situated at varying depths within the walls and containing ceramic objects above the interred's head. Pottery vessels found in the side chambers offered archaeologists a rare opportunity to determine whether the Mogou consumed fermented beverages and what brewing methods they likely used. Researchers analysed residue remains in about 42 pottery vessels spanning different periods at the Mogou site. They identified the use of various plants in these residues, such as rice, millet, Job's tears, buckwheat, and plants belonging to the Triticeae family, including barley and wheat. The study confirmed previous research findings that the Mogou people consumed a diverse range of plant foods during the second millennium BC.

Read our A manumea, the closest living relative of the , has been sighted for the first time since 2013, raising hope that the critically endangered species can be saved from extinction. Society’s latest field survey, conducted from 17 October to 13 November, recorded at least five sightings of involve the same individual or different birds. All individuals observed appeared to be adults, so we cannot confirm whether the species is nesting in the area or simply foraging,” Moeumu Uili, project coordinator at the Samoa Conservation Society, told local media. Wildlife experts say the rainforest valleys near Uafato village, where the sightings occurred, may be playing a role in protecting the bird and its habitat from cyclonic damage. Manumea’s reliance on the large native seeds that other birds cannot consume has made it a national symbol in Samoa, though many people in the country don’t know what it looks like, experts say. The bird is known to play a key role in dispersing these large seeds, thereby helping maintain Samoa’s forest ecosystems. The dodo-like bird was known to exist in the Samoan rainforest but had proved difficult to photograph due to its quick movement and rainy conditions. The chicken-sized bird with an unusually thick, curved beak that bears tooth-like serrations is the only living species of the genus Surveys in the early 1990s indicated there were some 7,000 manumeas in Samoa. But rampant habitat destruction decimated the species, with only 50-150 thought to exist as of 2024. Efforts to spot and track the bird highlight the challenges in protecting wildlife species from extinction, particularly in fragile island ecosystems, where they are vulnerable to invasive predators like feral cats and rats. “It seems very likely that feral cats are a major cause of decline. There has to be some kind of control programme,” Joe Wood, who works on manumea conservation efforts at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, told Researchers are working to deploy advanced AI sound monitoring tools to locate the bird in the future and understand its behaviour.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our When Cami Teacoach's son turned three she set out to find volunteer opportunities they could do together. He made cards for senior citizens. They hiked and picked up trash. He helped harvest produce at community gardens and made seed balls out of mud, throwing them into the forest to promote wildflower growth. Teacoach had reached out to many organizations looking for volunteer projects that she could do with her young child, but most places said no, so she came up with her own. “Everyone was like, 'A 3-year-old can’t do that,'” Teacoach said. “And I was like, ‘No, I swear, he really can if you would just give him a chance.’” Volunteering with children can instill confidence in youngsters, teach social and problem-solving skills and provide unique ways for families to bond. During the holiday season, many people seek such opportunities, looking for ways to give back. But often nonprofit organizations seek helpers who are at least 18 years old. Finding volunteer work to do as a family with young children can be challenging, but there are opportunities, if you persist. “There’s a million different ways to help people and volunteer. So many families want to do this and literally just don’t know where to start,” said Polly Lagana, executive director of Volunteer !, which connects people with service opportunities. “In a turbulent time in our world, families — and parents in particular — are very interested in showing their kids how they can help out and how they can give back.” excel at activities such as sorting coats, packing groceries and following through on tasks, said Sapreet Saluja, executive director of New York Cares, which works with organizations to develop volunteer programs in New York City. “I’ve been very impressed with the detail-orientation and the precision and the following of directions and the care that some kids I’ve seen, as young as six, take to the tasks that they’re doing,” Saluja said. “It’s been explained to them that this is to benefit someone, and it’s important, and they’re following the directions and they want to get it just right. And in many cases, they’re more detail-oriented than the adults, which I think is very inspiring."" To get started, look for organizations in your community that match volunteers with family-friendly projects and reach out to ask if there’s a minimum age requirement. Here are some other ways to involve little ones in projects that help the community. Children prefer to have agency and information to make a decision, so include them when you’re choosing an activity, Lagana said. “Let them know what problem you’re trying to fix in your community, and maybe one or two options of how that problem can be fixed,” Lagana said. For example, you can explain there are people who don’t have enough food, and children in the hospital who might not have blankets, and then ask, ‘Which one do you think you want to help out with?’ she suggested. Consider volunteering for a mission that you can explain to your child, such as cleaning up litter at a park. are unbelievably curious. They ask questions about what they’re doing, what they're seeing, what they're feeling, what they’re hearing, and it opens up a dialogue,” Saluja said. “It helps you see even at a young age some of the challenges that society is facing and it gives you agency to know that you can be a part of the solution.” Children understand hunger, and they can help alleviate the problem. They can sort grocery boxes at a food pantry or help deliver sustenance to home-bound individuals. Aviva Davis was about eight years old when she and her brother Brendan began helping her parents deliver to senior citizens and medically frail individuals in Denver. Initially, they rode in the car with their parents and helped bring food to the door. When they were older, they took turns driving. “It definitely opened my eyes to what the world is like outside of our bubble. We saw all sorts of different things and I saw not everyone lives the same way,” said Davis, now 17. “But even at such a young age I could realize it’s amazing what we’re doing that we could help people that aren’t as lucky as we were.” Davis became a resource at school for fellow students looking to volunteer. She still does monthly meal deliveries with her parents. “It’s a great chance for us to catch up as a family,” said her father, Seth Davis. “When we’re not all on our phones, you get some pretty cool quality time."" Her brother is now in college, but when he's home, they do deliveries altogether. “The older they get, the harder it is to get that time together,” said their mother, Bonnie Davis, who found the Meals on Wheels opportunity after extensive research. When Teacoach couldn't find organizations willing to accept her toddler, she started a group in Pittsburgh called VolunTOTs, which creates service opportunities for children as young as 3. The children and their parents pack 500 boxes of groceries to distribute to families in need, play bingo with seniors in nursing homes and make dog treats for an animal rescue center, among other projects. Parents have told Teacoach their children's conduct improves after volunteering. “They feel so good about themselves, they were a helper, and that translates into better behavior,” she said. Stephanie Bernaba’s family started “Tough Cookies,” a project where they bake and deliver cookies to veterans, when her son Matthew was in eighth grade and had to complete a service project for school. “Going up to the houses, it was very nice, because they’re mostly living alone. A lot of their family or friends died,” said Michael Bernaba, 14, now a freshman at The Prout School in Wakefield, Rhode Island. “It’s just nice to be there and bring it to them ... They were very happy, especially for someone to bring them treats like that.” The project also helped the teens learn social skills and meet people in various stages of life and health conditions, Stephanie Bernaba said. “We went to the first couple of places and I was really scared, because I’m more of a shy person,” Matthew Bernaba, now 15, said. “For the first couple of deliveries I was more to myself, and as we kept going, we talked more with the veterans and got to hear great stories from them.” Children can be more willing to try new activities with a buddy, so consider signing up with people you know. You can also connect with a nonprofit in need of a service and invite other families over to do a project together, as Lagana's friends have done, organizing clothing donations or assembling snack packs in living rooms. Bonnie Davis organized a drive for menstrual supplies, and families gathered in her backyard to assemble the baskets. She also turned half of her son's graduation party into a volunteer project assembling kits of bean soup. “It’s a win for everybody. You get quality time, you’re raising your children with what feels like good values, and people benefit,” she said. Send your wellness questions and story ideas to cbussewitz@ap.org.

Read our may not seem like the most obvious pairing, but they share one vital thing in common: both are about abundance. From the overloaded festive table to the multi-course Italian feast, the focus is firmly on feeding, sharing and enjoying. And with that abundance inevitably comes leftovers – but this doesn’t mean boring repeats of turkey sandwiches and reheated veg. give classic Christmas staples a Mediterranean twist, turning leftovers into three simple yet satisfying dishes. Think turkey thigh meatballs served over creamy polenta with a rich tomato sauce – a comforting dish with a new take on tradition. Or cacciatore-style chicken thighs paired with a silky bread sauce, transforming your roast leftovers into a vibrant Italian-inspired centerpiece. And for something lighter, there’s turkey and mushroom orzotto, a speedy risotto-like dish that swaps rice for orzo pasta and feels just the right side of indulgent. If you can’t find polenta, swap it out for cheesy mashed potato. 1. Preheat the oven to 200C and line a medium tray with baking paper this will be for the meatballs later. 2. Tip 50g of breadcrumbs and 75ml of the milk into a large mixing bowl mix to combine. We will use the rest of the milk later on. 3. Tip 250g of turkey mince into the bowl with the milk and breadcrumbs. Season with ½ tsp of allspice and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Mix to combine. 4. Shape the mix into 6 even-sized balls with moistened hands and plonk them onto the lined tray. Remember to wash your hands after handling raw meat! 5. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until golden in places and cooked throughout. Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait. 6. Tip the remaining 375ml of milk and a generous pinch of salt into a medium saucepan and place it over a medium-high heat. While the milk comes up to a simmer, get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps. 7. Peel and thinly slice 4 cloves of garlic. 8. Fry the garlic in a medium frying pan over a medium heat in 2 tbsp of olive oil for 2-3 minutes, until golden in places. Crack on with a bit of washing up while you wait. 9. Tip in 1 400g tin of tomatoes. Add 1 tsp of vinegar, ½ tsp of sugar and a generous pinch of salt. 10. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until reduced by half. Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait. 11. Once the milk on the stove has come to a simmer, slowly stream in 75g of polenta, beating all the while with a whisk. 12. Turn the heat down to very low and continue to cook the grains for 5-8 minutes, stirring every few minutes, until the mix slightly dries and has the consistency of loose mashed potato. Add a splash of milk if it starts to get too thick. Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait. 13. Finely chop 15g of parsley. While you wait for the rest of the dish to cook, crack on with a bit of washing up! 14. Once the polenta is ready, take the pan off the heat and finely grate over 30g of cheese. Add 3⁄4 of the parsley and fold everything together we will use the rest of the parsley for garnish. 15. Divide the polenta between plates and add the meatballs. Spoon over the tomato sauce, scatter over the parsley and serve. Chicken cacciatore is a classic Italian dish that usually takes AGES to cook. Whip up this cheat’s version in no time! 2. Add 2 tbsp of the olive oil to a large, oven-proof frying pan and add 4 chicken thighs, skin-side down lightly season with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Halve, peel and thinly slice 1 onion and 4 cloves of garlic. Deseed and thinly slice 2 red peppers. 4. Once the chicken thighs are golden, transfer them to a plate. Fry the veg in the residual fat for 6-8 minutes, tossing occasionally, until soft. Crack on with a bit of washing up while you wait. 5. Once the veg is soft, add 2 tbsp of tomato paste. Fry everything for a further 2-3 minutes, until dark and sticky. 6. Whack the heat up to high and tip 187ml of wine into the pan. Reduce by 1⁄2, stirring all the while. 7. Crumble in a beef stock cube and lay on the thighs, skin side up. 8. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced by 1⁄2. Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait. 9. Tip 50g of breadcrumbs into a medium saucepan. Add 400ml of milk, ½ tsp of allspice, a generous pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper. 10. Place the pan over a high heat and bring everything to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and simmer for 3-4 minutes, until thickened we are looking for a loose mashed potato-like consistency. 11. Divide the bread sauce between plates and spoon on the chicken cacciatore, making sure to serve 2 thighs on each plate. Tuck in! If you aren’t feeling turkey, why not swap it out for sausage meat? 1. Rip 200g of wild mushrooms into bite-sized chunks. 2. Tip 2 tbsp of olive oil into a large frying pan and place it over a high heat. 3. Once the oil starts to shimmer and loosen, add the mushrooms and 250g of turkey mince. Fry for 6-8 minutes, until golden in places. 4. Add 200g of orzo to the pan and toss to coat it in the oil. 5.

Read our Scores of longstanding and beloved restaurants across the U.S have closed this year, and more may follow, as the skyrocketing cost of necessities takes a toll on the industry. Over the past five years, food and labor costs for the average restaurant have each risen 35 percent, according to Meanwhile, the price tag on other essentials like rent, supplies, and credit card processing fees also continues to grow – meaning smaller profit margins for already-struggling restaurants. For Mario Magalhaes, whose family owned the popular Miami lunch spot, Las Palmas, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a 30 percent loss of clientele, many of whom never returned. The loyal customers who would come in during the work week for lunch or a cup of coffee disappeared due to remote and hybrid schedules, Magalhaes said. However, the high cost of food was the final nail in the coffin, prompting the historic joint to close last month after 45 years. “Las Palmas wasn’t pretentious. It was just kind of that taste of old Miami, and it differentiated itself from what’s popping up all over the country, which I would say is a little copy and paste, rinse and repeat,” Magalhaes, whose father bought the business from a family friend in 2016, told The restaurant ran “like a machine” until the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw prices rise exponentially – without ever returning to normal, according to Magalhaes. “Maybe three months ago, I saw eggs spike. The box of 15 dozen eggs used to be $20. It spiked about three months ago to $132,” Magalhaes said. “Corporations are not going to lower their prices if people are used to paying what they’re already paying,” Magalhaes said. “Even my wholesalers were more expensive at times than Whole Foods, which seems crazy, but I was comparing prices at many places,” he added. The growing costs of ingredients – and Magalhaes' conviction to remain an unpretentious and affordable neighborhood watering hole – meant things quickly became too expensive to sustain. “Las Palmas, being a small, 33-seat diner – casual, good food – I can’t have a 1,000 percent increase in prices, especially as a breakfast and lunch spot,” Magalhaes said. While Magalhaes raised prices only a little over time to try and keep up, he also tried other avenues to sustain business, including by throwing community comedy nights with some of the top local comedians. Despite Magalhaes’ best efforts, Las Palmas shut down for good on Friday, November 14. “We know that food costs are up 38 percent since the pandemic. That’s the national average. Labor costs are up 35 percent, and we have also seen pretty significant increases in insurance, and taxes and everything else,” Dr. Chad Moutray, the chief economist at the National Restaurant Association, told The all-around high costs have eaten into the overall profits of a lot of full-service restaurants, leaving the median profit margin at 2.8 percent in 2024, according to Moutray. “If you go back five years to 2019, that would have been four percent, so you’ve seen some profit squeeze there,” Moutray added. Challenges have long plagued restaurateurs, Moutray said, noting that data suggests there are still more openings than closures overall. “Restaurants and, in fact, all businesses have just had to deal with one challenge after another,” Moutray said. “In a market where it's a tough business anyway, I think restaurant operators have found it to be quite challenging. Las Palmas, the popular Miami lunch destination, is far from the only beloved restaurant struggling amidst the current economic climate. Owners of shuttered restaurants from all across the country are speaking out online about the many factors, including cost, that have led to their businesses closing for good. Osteria 545, an Italian restaurant in Paulsboro, New Jersey, thanked customers for five years of business while announcing they closed their doors on November 17. “Over the past year, we’ve witnessed a significant shift—fewer people dining out, while the costs of food, liquor, electricity, and other essentials have risen sharply. These increases have far outpaced what small, independent restaurants like ours can reasonably absorb, making this decision both heartbreaking and necessary. We’ve held on as long as we could, adjusting menus, tightening budgets, and doing everything possible to stay afloat. However, the margins continued to shrink, and the weight became unsustainable,” the restaurant’s owners The owners of City Cafe, a beloved 124-year-old restaurant in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, also revealed their plans to call it quits online. “It breaks our hearts to have to make this post but, this economy has literally broke us,” Teresa and Rollin Kellog wrote online, “We have tried so hard to stay ahead but when you have more going out than coming in it catches up to you.” Rent hikes and greedy landlords have also been an issue for many restaurants trying to stay afloat. For the Dallas, Texas, mainstay of 15 years, the Meddlesome Moth, a new landlord seeking a 40 percent rent hike is what led to their closing in May, owner and restaurateur Shannon Wynne told “They realized the market could stand about a 40 percent hike in our rent, and really disregarded the contributions we made to the neighborhood,” Wynne said. According to Wynee, numerous developers in Dallas’ Design District are currently pushing out more affordable and approachable spots, like the Meddlesome Moth, in favor of more “high-end” spots. “We focused on value and flavor and creativity, but you know, the margins aren’t great,” Wynne said. “When the rent goes up as much as it did, we’re at that point losing money, and we’re not willing to change our concept because of the portfolio aggression of these landlords.” Moutray, the chief economist with the National Restaurant Association, noted that while many restaurants are now starting to cater to a more high-spending crowd, most are still just looking to deliver a quality service. “You certainly are seeing restaurants that are catering to more high-end consumers, and are continuing to do relatively well,” Moutray said. “People with money are still spending it.” Even still, Moutray remained cautiously optimistic for what lies ahead for the restaurant industry. “I do think that 2026 provides some cautious optimism, right? That we will see some tailwinds of growth; hopefully, we can turn around some of those traffic trends. You can see some of those cost pressures start to ease a bit,” Moutray said. “I think if those happen, hopefully we’ll have a better 2026.”",The Independent,The Independent

Ms Robb added: “It was a sad thing to happen on what had been such a positive morning. “I just feel sorry for those who have been affected. “I think it will be shocking for the whole community. We are a small town. “I think it is important to think of the friends and families of those who have been affected.” HM Coastguard said it had responded to reports of “people in difficulty” in the water in the Budleigh Salterton area. Coastguard rescue teams from Exmouth and Beer attended, along with Coastguard search and rescue helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, along with police and ambulance personnel were also sent to the scene. RNLI lifeboat crews helped recover one person from the water. A spokesman said: “All lifeboat crew were stood down by the coastguard around 5pm, when they returned to stations. “Our thoughts are with all those impacted by the incident and the family and friends of the two people who are missing.” A number of Christmas and Boxing Day swims in and Cornwall were cancelled this year because of a yellow weather warning for wind which covered parts of the South West and Wales. No warnings were issued for Boxing Day but Detective Superintendent Hayley Costar said: “We urge anyone with plans to go swimming in the sea on Boxing Day not to.” Describing the events in Budleigh Salterton as “a truly tragic incident”, she had said: “Our thoughts remain firmly with the families and friends of the two men who are currently missing and to all who may have witnessed and be impacted by the incident.”",The Independent,The Independent

Images released by Syria’s state-run Arab News Agency showed blood on the mosque’s carpets, holes in the walls, shattered windows and fire damage. The Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque is located in an area of the Wadi al-Dhahab neighborhood dominated by the Alawite minority in Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. SANA, citing a security source, said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque. Authorities were searching for the perpetrators of the attack. A security cordon was placed around the mosque, Syria’s Tensions have flared across several parts of Syria in recent weeks as long-running sectarian, ethnic and political fault lines continue to destabilize the country, even as large-scale fighting has subsided. The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of President last year. Assad, himself an Alawite, fled the country to Russia. Members of his sect have been subjected to crackdowns. In March, an ambush carried out by Assad’s supporters against security forces triggered days of violence that left hundreds of people dead, most of them Alawites. Local officials condemned Friday's attack, saying it came “within the context of repeated desperate attempts to undermine security and stability and sow chaos among the Syrian people.” “Syria reiterates its firm stance in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added in a statement. “Remnants of the former regime, ISIS militants and collaborators have converged on a single goal: obstructing the path of the new state by undermining stability, threatening civil peace, and eroding the shared coexistence and common destiny of throughout history,” the Syrian information minister said in a post on X. Neighboring countries, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon, also condemned the attack. In a statement, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun reaffirmed “Lebanon’s support for Syria in its fight against terrorism.” On Monday, clashes have erupted intermittently between Syrian government forces and Kurdish-led fighters, the Syrian Democratic Forces, in mixed neighborhoods in the northern city of Aleppo, forcing temporary closures of schools and public institutions and prompting civilians to shelter indoors. A late-evening ceasefire was then announced by both sides amid ongoing de-escalation efforts.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/amazon-cardiff-university-b2890688.html,Why your holiday gift returns might go to a landfill and what you can do about it,2025-12-26T13:55:54.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our The holiday season will soon come to a close, but the busiest time of the year for product returns is just beginning. The National Retail Federation estimates 17% of holiday purchases will be sent back this year. More retailers are reporting extended return windows and increased holiday staff to handle the rush this year. A major driver for returns is uncertainty. When we buy for other people, finding what they want is a bit of a guessing game. Online purchases have higher return rates because finding the right size and color is tough when you're just staring at images on screens. “Clothing and footwear, as you can imagine, because fit is such an important criteria, they have higher rates of returns,” said Saskia van Gendt, chief sustainability officer at Blue Yonder, which sells software designed to improve companies' supply chain management. Returns come with an environmental cost, but there's a lot consumers and companies are doing to minimize it. If a company sells a thing, it's probably packaged in plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and oil production releases emissions that warm the planet. If that thing is bought online, it's put on a plane or a train or a truck that usually uses oil-based fuel. If you buy a thing and return it, it goes through most or all of that all over again. And once those products are back with the retailer, they may be sent along to a refurbisher, liquidator, recycler or landfill. All these steps require more travel, packaging and energy, ultimately translating to more emissions. Joseph Sarkis, who teaches supply chain management at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, estimates that returning an item increases its impact on the planet by 25% to 30%. Roughly a third of the time, those returns don't make their way to another consumer. Because frequently, it's not worth reselling. If, for example, you get a phone, but you send it back because you don't like the color, the seller has to pay for the fuel and equipment to get the phone back, and then has to pay for the labor to assess whether it has been damaged since leaving the facility. “It can be quite expensive,” said Sarkis. “And if you send it out to a new customer and the phone is bad, imagine the reputational hit you’ll get. You’ll get another return and you’ll lose a customer who’s unhappy with the product or material. So the companies are hesitant to take that chance.” Something as expensive as a phone might get sold to a secondary or refurbishment market. But that $6 silicone spatula you got off Amazon? Probably not worth it. Plus, some stuff — think a bathing suit or a bra — is less attractive to customers if there's a chance it's been resold. The companies know that. And that's where the costs of returns are more than just environmental — and consumers wind up paying. Even free returns aren't really free. “Refurbishment, inspection, repackaging, all of these things get factored into the retail price,” said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University. If you want to reduce the impact of your returns, the first move is to increase their chances of resale. Be careful not to damage it, and reuse the packaging to send it back, said If you have to return something, do it quickly. That ugly Christmas sweater you got at the white elephant office party has a much better chance of selling on Dec. 20 than it does on Jan. 5. Zhang said it's not worth the cost to the company to store that sweater once it's gone out of season. Another tip: in-person shopping is better than online because purchases get returned less often, and in-person returns are better, too — because those items get resold more often. Zhang said it reduces landfill waste. Sarkis said it reduces emissions because companies with brick-and-mortar locations spread out across the country and closer to consumers thus move restocked goods shorter distances. “If I can return in-store, then I definitely will,"" Zhang said. “The managers can put that stuff back to the market as soon as possible.” Obviously the best thing consumers can do is minimize returns. Many shoppers engage in “bracketing behavior,” or buying multiple sizes of the same item, keeping what fits, and returning the rest. “This behavior of bringing the dressing room to our homes is not sustainable,” said Faires. If you're buying for someone else, you can also consider taking the guesswork out of the equation and going for a gift card. “I know we do really want to pick up something really nice to express our love for our friends or our family. But if we are more sustainable, probably the gift card will be much better than just purchasing the product,” Zhang said. Sarkis wants to see companies provide more information in product descriptions about the environmental impact of returning an item, or how much of the purchase price factors in return costs. “But I don’t know if they want to send a negative message,"" he said. “If you're telling someone to stop something because of negative results, that's not going to sell.” Sarkis and Zhang both say charging for returns would help. Already On the tech side, Blue Yonder’s recent acquisition of Optoro, a company that provides a return management system for retailers and brands, uses a software to quickly assess the condition of returned products and route them to stores that are most likely to resell them. “Having that process be more digitized, you can quickly assess the condition and put it back into inventory,” said van Gendt. “So that’s a big way to just avoid landfill and also all of the carbon emissions that are associated with that.” Clothing is returned most often. Many sizes do not reflect specific measurements, like women's dresses, so they vary a lot between brands. Zhang said better sizing could help reduce the need for returns. On top of that, Sarkis said more 3D imaging and virtual reality programs could help customers be more accurate with their purchases, saving some returns.

Then a man tried to hit me on the Tube’,2025-12-26T14:12:56.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Fatima Mahmoud* decided to wear a niqab, a face veil, for the while getting on the Tube in London. A man on the platform at Whitechapel station stared and shook his head, before shouting and pretending to punch the air at her. The man mimicked the niqab by putting his fingers over his eyes like goggles. Her friend took a picture of him, which led to the man running up to them and attempting to hit them, while witnesses confronted him. Despite being a British-born and raised Muslim, the 23-year-old told : “I don’t feel safe at all here in the UK. I drive as much as I can and try to be wary of my surroundings. Public transport scares me now, especially because this incident happened in the afternoon. It wasn’t dark outside. “I was scared to wear the niqab again until I rebuilt my confidence. I constantly look over my shoulder in case someone punches me from behind.” Her story comes at a time when almost half of Muslim women (45 per cent) , compared to just 8 per cent of women nationally, according to a new report by Muslim Census. More than one in three (34 per cent) of Muslim women said they have the survey of 1,155 people in November 2025 found. These experiences range from assault, verbal abuse, being spat at, having their headscarf pulled, and even being urinated on, the study said. Ms Mahmoud said she reported the incident to the police but has seen no progress. The British Transport Police (BTP) said the investigation has been closed pending new evidence coming to light, as all current lines of enquiry have been followed. Nearly two-thirds of Muslim women believe they are targeted because they wear the hijab, niqab or other visible markers of Muslim identity. Data from Tell MAMA, which stands for Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks, reveals that many visibly Muslim women “suffer repeat and multiple incidents of anti-Muslim hate throughout their lives”, and many have even removed their identifying clothing out of fear. Tell MAMA director Iman Atta added: “We had cases reported where Muslim women wearing the niqab were denied access to services, and where bus drivers would not stop for them at bus stops.” Furvah Shah was left shocked, confused and in pain at a Tube station after being physically assaulted by a total stranger. she was just entering Marble Arch station when a young blonde woman kicked her and said, “You deserved that.” Ms Shah was kicked in early September, a week before the attended by 150,000 people. This follows a wave of summer anti-migrant protests over During far-right demonstrations, nearly all Muslims (93.8 per cent) feel less safe, and 84.9 per cent actively adjust their travel behaviour, according to the survey. For women, the figures are even higher, with 96.3 per cent feeling less safe and 90.7 per cent changing their travel plans. Ms Shah said: “This is a symptom of rising far-right sentiment. People feel emboldened to do things like this, and we're the ones who suffer. I’ve been more cautious of public transport and also on edge in general because I fear it is not a one-off incident.” Ms Atta said far-right protests have psychological impacts and can “trigger feelings of fear and trauma effects”, particularly on Muslim women and young people. Ms Shah reported the incident to the police as a hate crime, but in the end, she decided not to escalate the case. Sumaiya Khan*, 24, was six months pregnant when she said she was subjected to a racial slur in August 2024, Ms Khan was waiting at a Luton station bus stop when a middle-aged white man sat next to her. She said he started saying “there were too many ‘brownies’ around. He then looked at me and called me an ‘f***ing P***’”. She described feeling “angry” and “fearful to go out in public”, after assuming slurs like that were outdated from her parents’ generation. She did not report the incident to the police. The survey found only 12.5 per cent of incidents are reported to BTP, local police or transport staff. Of those reported, 69 per cent felt unconfident that it would be taken seriously. A majority of Muslims, 83.1 per cent, believe Islamophobia is treated less seriously than other hate crimes, as of prosecution rates for religiously aggravated offences remain low. Ms Atta said: “Anti-Muslim hate or Islamophobia is on the significant rise and the rhetoric around Muslim migrants is adding to this. It gives settled British Muslims the impression that they are ‘the other’ and that they are not accepted. “This can have real-world impacts for social cohesion, integration and extremism and also divides communities in the ‘culture war’ debates. Some politicians have a lot to answer for in the pursuit of power.” Mandy McGregor, Transport for London's head of policing, said: “We are absolutely appalled to hear of these horrendous incidents. Islamophobia and all forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and we are deeply sorry [they] have experienced this on our network. We work closely with the police to stamp out hate crime on our network and we are following up with the police about these incidents.” A BTP spokesperson said: “Abuse, intimidation, and violence – especially that which is motivated by hate – will never be tolerated, and we have acted swiftly and decisively when we receive reports of hate crimes on the network.” Hate crime victims or witnesses are encouraged to report via text on 61016 or call 0800 405040.",The Independent,The Independent

Even on cloudy days, it’s important to apply as the UV rays can still reach our skin,” he said. Ultraviolet - or UV - radiation from the sun is what leaves us at risk for skin cancer: the most common form of cancer in the U.S. that leads to thousands of deaths each year. Invisible to the human eye, the rays are also what cause sunburns, wrinkles and skin aging. Although UV levels are lower in the winter because the Earth tilts away from the sun, the radiation is still damaging and Rays from the sun hitting snow and ice in the winter can increase the intensity of the rays and your risk for skin damage - just like a day at the beach. Clouds only reduce the UV levels by about 50 percent, according to the National institutes of Health With even the lowest UV levels on a scale between zero and 15 - with zero to two at the lowest - it takes only an hour to burn, “If you’re outdoors and can see your hand in front of your face, there is enough UV exposure to cause skin damage,” dermatologist Dr. Mona Gohara told , adding that the snow can reflect up to 80 percent of the sun’s rays back onto the skin. Experts say the best thing to do is to wear sunscreen between the peak daylight hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. year-round. The sunscreen should be water resistant and broad spectrum, meaning that it can protect your skin from any harmful UV rays, and should have a sun protection factor, or SPF, rating of 30 or higher. An SPF rating of 30 reflects 97 percent of UVB rays, which are responsible for producing sunburns and cause the deadliest skin cancers. Apply the sunscreen 20 minutes before heading outdoors and reapply it every two hours to stay shielded, the Putting it on will protect from cancer and keep your skin looking younger. “UV exposure is one of the primary causes of premature aging, leading to wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the ministry said that houses and infrastructure were destroyed. Thailand’s military confirmed the attack, saying that a joint army-air force operation was essential to protect Thailand’s Sa Kaeo province, which borders Banteay Meanchey and where the two nations have overlapping territorial claims. Long-standing competing claims of territory along the border are the root of tensions that broke into open combat in late July. Mediation by Malaysian Prime Minister , backed up by pressure from U.S. President , led the two sides to agree to a shaky ceasefire after five days of fighting. Each side describes its current military actions as being taken in self-defense, and blames the other for breaching the ceasefire. “If Cambodia is not sincere about a ceasefire, peace will not be possible, and Thailand will have no choice but to proceed with full-scale military operations to defend its sovereignty,” Air Marshal Jackkrit Thammavichai, a spokesperson for Thailand’s air force, said Friday.

Read our Sanusi Madabo, a 40-year-old farmer in the Nigerian village of Jabo, was preparing for bed Thursday night when he heard a loud noise that sounded like a plane crashing. He rushed outside his mud house with his wife to see the sky glowing a bright red. The light burned bright for hours, Madabo said: “It was almost like daytime."" He did not learn until later that he witnessed a U.S attack on an alleged announced late Thursday that the U.S had launched a “powerful and deadly strike” against “ISIS Terrorist Scum in north-west Nigeria.” The Nigerian government had since confirmed the strike was a joint collaboration with the U.S government. Residents of Jabo, a village in the northwestern Nigerian state of Sokoto, told The Associated Press in interviews Friday that they were seized with panic and confusion after airstrikes targeted the town. They also said the village had never experienced a terror attack, even though attacks regularly occur in neighboring villages. “As it approached our area, the heat became intense,"" recalled Abubakar Sani, who lives just a few houses from the scene of the explosion. ""Our rooms began to shake, and then fire broke out,” he told the AP. “The Nigerian government should take appropriate measures to protect us as citizens. We have never experienced anything like this before.” The Nigerian military did not respond to an AP request asking how many locations were targeted. It's a ""new phase of an old conflict"" The strikes are the outcome of a months-long tense diplomatic clash between the West African nation and the U.S. that has evolved to result in a new form of cooperation. The Trump administration has been claiming that Nigeria is witnessing a genocide, a claim the Nigerian government has rejected, and which caused initial tensions. But now Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the strikes resulted from intelligence sharing and strategic coordination between the two governments. Yusuf Tuggar, Nigeria's foreign minister, called the airstrikes a “new phase of an old conflict"" and said he expected more strikes to follow. “For us, it is something that has been ongoing,"" Tuggar added, referring to attacks that have targeted Christians and Muslims in Nigeria for years. Bulama Burkati, a security analyst on sub-Saharan Africa at the Tony Blair Institute, said the fear of residents is compounded by a lack of information. Residents say there were no casualties, and security operatives have cordoned off the area. But the Nigerian government has yet to release information on the militants who were targeted and the post-strike assessment of casualties. “What can help in dousing the tension is for the American and Nigerian governments to declare who was targeted, what was attacked, and what has happened so far,” Burkati said. Such information is ""still missing, and the more opaque the governments are, the more panic there would be on the ground, and that is what will escalate tension.” Analysts say the strikes might have been intended for the Lakurawa group, a relatively new entrant to Nigeria's complex security crisis. The group's first attack was recorded around 2018 in the northwestern region before the Nigerian government officially announced its presence last year. The composition of the group has been documented by security researchers as primarily consisting of foreigners from the Sahel region of Africa. However, experts say ties between the Lakurawa group and the Islamic State are unproven. The Islamic State West African Province, a branch of ISIS in Nigeria, has its strongholds in the northeastern part of the country, where it is currently involved in a power struggle with its parent organisation, “What might have happened is that, working with the American government, Nigeria identified Lakurawa as a threat and identified camps that belong to the group,” Burkati said. Aliyu Garba, a traditional leader in the village, told the AP that debris left by the strikes was scattered around and residents rushed to the scene before the arrival of security operatives. picked up metal pieces hoping for valuable metal which they could trade, and he fears they could get hurt. The strikes also rattled 17-year-old Balira Sa’idu as she prepared to get married. “I am supposed to be thinking about my wedding, but right now I am panicking,"" she said. “The strike has changed everything. My family is afraid, and I don’t even know if it is safe to continue with the wedding plan in Jabo.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Tucker Carlson wondered this week if former Repulican Rep. Matt Gaetz had attempted a romantic relationship with Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, prompting the to reply that he never asked the progressive congresswoman on a date because she’s “not my cup of tea.” on far-right cable channel One America News, also claimed that Ocasio-Cortez had previously been “incredibly chummy” with her GOP House colleagues, but that everything changed after the January 6 Capitol attack. On top of that, Gaetz also asserted that the New York representative personally praised his successful 2023 campaign to boot then-Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy from leadership, purportedly telling the former Florida congressman that Democrats “don’t have the guts to do this on our side.” During the lengthy sitdown between Gaetz and the ex-Fox News star, the two eventually discussed who they thought was the true leader of the Democratic Party, with Carlson calling Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) a “f***ing coward” before pivoting to Ocasio-Cortez. “If he was real, at least I could respect it. AOC is the same thing,” Carlson sneered. “AOC is a very different person today than when she got to Congress,” Gaetz replied, leading Carlson to accuse her of being “totally corrupted” and saying that the Israel-Gaza War is “fine.” Gaetz, meanwhile, insisted that Ocasio-Cortez had once patted him on the back over “When we were ousting McCarthy, like, she came up to me and was like, ‘You know, I really respect this because I’ll be honest. We don’t have the guts to do this on our side,'” the former Republican congressman said. At that point, Carlson wanted to know what Ocasio-Cortez was like privately – and whether Gaetz had ever tried to make the moves on her when they both served in Congress. “Before January 6th, she was incredibly chummy with Republicans in Congress, would regularly come over to our side, sit down, hang out, talk about her day,” Gaetz responded, only for Carlson to wonder if he ever tried to date her. “No,” Gaetz answered. “Not my cup of tea. But she, after January 6th, treated us all like we had horns or something.” That response sparked Carlson – who helped lead the charge on Republicans’ January 6 revisionism – to mock Ocasio-Cortez for during the Capitol insurrection. “You can’t be in charge of anything if you’re a terrified little girl,” the fired Fox News host exclaimed. “Yeah, but we are a society that is increasingly built on grievance identity,” Gaetz added. “You are the grievance that you can access.” Still, while Gaetz called her reaction to the January 6 riots “bad performance art,” he predicted that she would make a “compelling run” for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, perhaps even defeating California Gov. Gavin Newsom – the early favorite. Besides the pair’s observations about Ocasio-Cortez, the extensive podcast conversion featured Gaetz claiming that an Israel government agent had been involved in a plot to extort him and his family. “It was an op to silence me, and Israel was involved, and I hate to say that,” Gaetz – who has largely sided with Carlson and other “America First” conservatives when it comes to criticizing Israel and its war in Gaza – declared. He also told Carlson that “antisemitism used to mean somebody who didn’t like Jews – now it just means somebody Jews don’t like.” Those remarks prompted self-appointed Trump “loyalty enforcer” and “proud Islamophobe” Laura Loomer – who is Jewish and a self-avowed Zionist – to “He’s trying to have a hostile takeover of the GOP to destroy MAGA & redefine the GOP into modern-day Hitler youth with a drizzle of Sharia Law on top,” she fumed. over sexual misconduct allegations, may now be securely on Team Tucker.

At one point, however, Carlson was taken aback by some claims Gaetz made. “You and I went to dinner about two years ago, your wife was there, and I brought a friend of mine, you’ll remember her,” Gaetz declared. “And she was actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn’t cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme that she could face trouble.” “I don’t remember the woman you are speaking of or the context at all, honestly,” a befuddled Carlson shot back. , only to finally return to Carlson’s show to maintain his innocence amid the DOJ’s investigation.

The six lawmakers, all of whom have military and intelligence backgrounds, warned military personnel against “threats to our Constitution” coming “from right here at home,” an apparent reference to the Trump administration’s deployment of federalized National Guard troops into Democratic-led cities to support the president’s mass deportation agenda — actions that veterans groups have also publicly condemned. It prompted Trump to call them ‘traitors” in a furious tirade posted on his Truth Social account. “Their words cannot be allowed to stand,” the president said. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???” He then reposted another user who encouraged him to “HANG THEM.” The billboards come amid rising tension with Venezuela following a months-long campaign of military strikes around the South American country targeting small vessels that U.S. officials allege are carrying drugs. The strikes have been condemned by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other leaders in the region as illegal but, so far, the U.S. has refrained from coming directly into conflict with Maduro’s government or any others in the region. Maduro remains adamant, however, that the U.S. is aiming to overthrow him and claimed that the country will fight a guerrilla war against U.S. forces if invaded. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced heavy renewed scrutiny after the U.S. military carried out a “double-tap” strike on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2, after it emerged the first attack did not kill everyone aboard. Administration officials insisted that the two dozen strikes were fully within legal bounds, supported by Hegseth later rejected bipartisan congressional demands to release footage of the strike.

Read our , was elated when the news arrived of a ceasefire between , bringing an end to two years of relentless bombardment. But just four weeks after it was announced, he received a phone call on his way to work at Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat to say that his daughter, Maysaa, had been killed by Israeli drone fire as she sheltered in a tent. “There is absolutely no safety; there is no hope for us to have any security,” he tells from the same tent in the Al-Atatra area of Beit Lahia, where he is living after being displaced. “I spent my life in hardship and misery.” Jaber’s daughter is one of at least 410 Palestinians to be killed since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. During a victory lap speech in the Knesset, US president Donald Trump had promised “peace for all eternity”. But for Gazans, the nightmare has not ended: it is a ceasefire in name only. In addition to the more than 400 Palestinians who have been killed, the health ministry says that 1,134 have been injured by Israeli shelling and gunfire. At least three Israeli troops have also been killed by Palestinian militants, while two people were killed on Friday in what Images show a landscape unchanged by two months of peace, with apartments razed to the ground and families wandering among the rubble. Humanitarian agencies continue to warn that nowhere near enough aid is entering the strip, which has been in the grip of a hunger crisis for most of the year. “From the very first moment, and every day, morning and evening, there is gunfire and artillery shelling in the yellow and non-yellow zones. There is no peace of mind. There is nowhere else for us to go. There is nothing but your own destroyed place,” says Jaber. “We are still suffering to this day. There is heavy gunfire and intense shelling, but this is the state of our country: a tragedy we did not choose.” The deadliest night of the “ceasefire” so far came on 29 October, when at least 109 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during an overnight attack. The Israeli military said the attack was a response to the killing of an IDF soldier by Hamas. The militant group said it had “no connection” to the incident. Dozens more Palestinians, including children, have been killed after crossing the “yellow line”. This refers to the boundary which Israeli forces agreed to withdraw from under Mr Trump’s ceasefire, but Gazans say its position is constantly changing – with deadly consequences. The Israeli military says its operations, in particular within the yellow line, are “carried out to address direct threats from terrorist organisations in Gaza”. But in one particularly horrific incident, two young boys – Fadi, 8, and Jumaa, 11 – had gone out to gather firewood for their wheelchair-bound father in Beni Suhaila, near Khan Younis. They were killed by a drone strike near a school sheltering displaced people. The IDF described the children as “two suspects who crossed the yellow line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops operating in the southern Gaza Strip, posing an immediate threat to them”. Israel says it has abided by the terms of the ceasefire, and has repeatedly described victims of its attacks as suspected terrorists. A dispute over aid is also ongoing, with humanitarian groups warning that far less aid than required is entering the strip. Hamas claims fewer trucks are entering Gaza than had been agreed, but Israel maintains that it is fulfilling all of its obligations under Mr Trump’s plan. As Israel and Hamas continue to trade blows, the suffering of ordinary Palestinians continues. Since his daughter’s death, Jaber says he has suffered psychologically, his weight plummeting from 100kg to 75kg. “I used to own three houses, and now I’m homeless in a tent,” he says. Imad Abu Shawish, a 38-year-old freelance journalist, has seen the horror of post-ceasefire Gaza up close. On 22 November, he sifted through the rubble of an Israeli airstrike on a residential building in Nuseirat, which killed 11 members of the Abu Shawish family, including two married couples and seven children. Only one daughter from the two families survived: 19-year-old Batoul. Imad pulled her from under the flattened building with his own hands. “There is absolutely no safety, no safety at all,” he tells “My life has changed drastically. My eating and drinking habits have changed. My emotional and psychological behaviour has changed. My feelings towards others have changed. I am still in shock, deeply traumatised.” He continues: “I don’t know where I am or what I am going through. What happened to me? I still don’t have an answer. I’ve become terrified, anxious, fearful, and panicky. Perhaps it’s because I’m afraid the war will return at any moment and we’ll be killed. “I don’t think these bad feelings will easily disappear from our minds. We need internal healing and psychological treatment.” Palestinians have also been suffering in severe winter weather, with strong winds and torrential rains tearing apart tents housing hundreds of thousands of homeless families. “Everyone’s tents are flooded,” says Abed al-Moneim al-Zein, a 60-year-old from northern Gaza who is currently displaced in Khan Younis. “There aren’t enough tents, mattresses, or blankets.” His brother Ameen, a 56-year-old from Beit Lahia with a wife and three daughters, was killed 19 days after the ceasefire came into effect. “Ameen loved his city dearly; he adored it,” recalls Abed. “He was always smiling and participated in all the city’s events, from celebrations to football matches. “The area he went to wasn’t a yellow zone. He went looking for shelter after losing his home. It was a school in the city centre.” Abed continued: “Life is nonexistent. There are no basic necessities. We live in fear, tension, anxiety, and terror. The war has affected us immensely, beyond human endurance.” The Israeli military said in a statement: “IDF troops under the Southern Command are deployed in the area in accordance with the ceasefire framework and will continue to act to remove any immediate threat. “In contrast, Hamas is not fulfilling its part of the agreement and has violated the ceasefire hundreds of times.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our as the dawn of a new era for peace in the Middle East. Yet since a ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, more in Israeli strikes, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel accuses Hamas of violating the ceasefire as well, including being behind IED explosions used against its soldiers. , in what it says is the first hypothermia-related death. The Palestinian health ministry says over a dozen people have now died as a result of extreme cold, as winter has set in. More than 90 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents remain displaced, most living in tents and exposed to flooding and freezing temperatures. And despite the global hunger monitor stating that Gaza is no longer technically in famine because of the entry of additional aid, humanitarian organisations In reality, the initial stage of the deal Trump has so heralded is teetering on a knife edge before talks between the warring parties about phase two have even started. The dawn of peace in the region is very far away. How can the critical points of phase two be hammered out when phase one is floundering and with both sides accusing each other of serious violations? There has been little to no movement. Last week, Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly hosted senior officials from across the region, including Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, in Miami, Florida. These negotiations were supposed to review the implementation of the second stage but, so far, no concrete steps have been taken. In the Trump plan, phase two was supposed to include the deployment of an international security force, the establishment of an internationally supervised technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas militants, and further Israeli troop withdrawals. But all this process is to be overseen by a so-called “Board of Peace” chaired by President Trump. It’s unclear who will be on that board or the executive council immediately under it. Tony Blair was slated as a key participant, but earlier this month was reportedly ruled out of running it. Other names I’ve heard floated include Egyptian real estate billionaire Naguib Sawiris, which is perhaps an indication of the priorities of these institutions. Phase two only addresses the basic “day after” temporary structures for Gaza. It doesn’t even tackle the difficult generation-long battles of Palestinian self-determination, of accountability and justice. The peace plan doesn’t mention the West Bank, which, since Hamas’s deadly 7 October attacks two years ago, has witnessed its bloodiest period since Israel first occupied the territory in 1967, according to rights groups. There are also concerns about some of the mechanisms that have been partly established. Right now, there is a proposed joint international command centre, reportedly based in a warehouse in Israel. From what I understand, it was supposed to be a place to monitor the ceasefire and aid flows and to generate ideas for the deal. It was initially welcomed by multiple stakeholders. In practice, I’ve been told it has become something of an embarrassment. Nothing is happening, and nothing is moving forward. Concerns are also growing about the underlying motives of all sides. Diplomatic and humanitarian sources fear that Israel is constructing a permanent boots-on-the-ground buffer zone kilometres into Gaza, where it continues to raze neighbourhoods and maintain a ground presence. This week, Israeli defence minister Israel Katz, speaking at a settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said the Israeli military would never leave all of Gaza. He said they planned to station a type of unit – Nahal – that has historically played a role in establishing Israeli communities, including settlements which are illegal under international law. He later distanced himself from the alarming comments, saying Israel has no interest in developing settlements in Gaza, but Hamas has said it is a clear violation of the ceasefire. There are also concerns that instead of there being a genuinely international, Palestinian-led administration to help with the transition of Gaza, a reconstituted version of Cogat is being developed to operate within the territory. Cogat is the Israeli military unit responsible for coordinating civilian affairs with Palestinians, like, for example, the entry of aid, which has been intermittently fully and partially strangled over the last two years. Israel has repeatedly denied any nebulous intentions, as it has also denied violating ceasefires, or committing any crimes intentionally or being responsible for genocide in Gaza (an accusation levelled at the country by the UN commission of inquiry). There are also concerns from Israel's side that Hamas has no interest in disarming or disbanding. Meanwhile, the violence is soaring in the occupied West Bank, settlement expansion is booming, and the displacement of Palestinians by Israelis continues. Obviously, a 20-point PDF is not going to be enough to solve the Gordian knot of this conflict. Especially when slaughter continues, the tough issues like Palestinian self-determination aren’t on the table, and key elements of its early phases are being trampled on. There needs to be an immediate and serious joint effort to put in place – and hold – a genuine and meaningful ceasefire, and start the long journey to true peace and justice.",The Independent,The Independent

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said that he was shocked by the “horrific killing spree.” He said that Israel was “committed to reinforcing and strengthening this challenging border and, of course, to bolstering the security response in the area for the full safety of the residents.” Israel's military soon after began amassing troops near the Palestinian town of Qabatiya, where Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that the assailant was from. Katz said that he’d ordered troops to “act forcefully and immediately” against what he called “terrorist infrastructure"" in the town. “Anyone who aids or sponsors terrorism will pay the full price,"" he said. It's common practice for Israel to launch raids in the West Bank towns that attackers come from or demolish homes belonging to the assailants’ families. Israel says that it helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevents future attacks. Rights watchdogs describe such actions as collective punishment. Raids have been conducted in the area of Qabatiya, which is in the northern West Bank near the major city of Jenin, over the last few weeks. On Dec. 20, Israel's military said that they killed a person in Qabatiya who “hurled a block toward the soldiers.” It later said that the killing was under review, after Palestinian media aired brief security footage in which the youth appears to emerge from an alley and is shot by troops as he approaches them without throwing anything. The Israel-Hamas war, which began with the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza.

Read our The use of mixed-sex wards in hospitals in England has soared to the highest number in a single month for nearly 15 years – despite health secretary slamming the practice under the last Conservative government. England show strict rules against their use were breached more than 5,000 times in January, for the first time since 2011. The most recent month for which there is data available, October, saw 4,801 breaches, higher than the 3,953 recorded during the same month when the Tories were in charge of the health service in 2023. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) hit out at the practice, which it said was “undignified and unsafe” as it called for urgent investment to increase both bed capacity and the ability for people to be treated at home and away from overwhelmed hospitals. the government said it was “not acceptable” for patients to share sleeping accommodation with members of the opposite sex, and it was reminding hospital trusts “robustly” on this point. Before last year’s general election, Mr Streeting criticised the continued use of Under official guidance that was updated in 2012, patients should not share wards overnight, share bathroom facilities or have to walk through areas occupied by patients of the opposite sex to get to the toilets. The shadow health secretary, Stuart Andrew, said: “It is a disgrace that mixed-sex ward breaches are at their highest point in more than a decade. “No patient should be left feeling exposed or unsafe, yet thousands are.” Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said that patients’ safety, dignity and clinical needs were always a top priority but added: “Sometimes caring for people in mixed wards can’t be helped as a result of extreme pressure on available beds.” He said that NHS trusts do everything they can to avoid it but “on occasion it’s better to be looking after a patient in a mixed-sex ward, rather than have to treat someone in a temporary space like a corridor due to a lack of free beds – which can be down to lots of factors, including very high demand or delays discharging some patients well enough to leave hospital but who have nowhere to go.” The last time the number of breaches was more than 5,000 in a single month was in March 2011, three months after the NHS started to record the numbers in the wake of the mass public outcry. By May of that year, they had fallen to below 2,000 a month and by the end of the year, numbered only in the hundreds. And that is how they stayed until late 2017, when they began to climb again. Under the last Conservative government, there were a number of months in which the number of breaches totalled more than 4,000. At the time, Mr Streeting said patients had been left at risk and feeling humiliated, but the first time the figure topped 5,000 in a single month was under Labour, in January, the official figures show. That month, the rules were broken 5,180 times, a breach rate of 2.7 per cent. A year earlier, before Labour came to power, the figure was 4,404, a rate of 2.6 per cent. In December, the figure was 4,549, also higher than the previous year’s 3,522 (2.7 per cent vs 2.2 per cent). June also saw breaches higher than the same month the previous year, 4,559 to 3,881 (2.5 per cent vs 2.2 per cent). Even during the Covid pandemic, the highest recorded figure was 4,929 in February 2020, although counting was suspended until October that year as the The Royal College of Nursing’s chief nursing officer, Lynn Woolsey, said: “Rising mixed-sex ward breaches is a sign of a health service under severe strain, which has too little space and too few beds to meet surging demand. It is common for patients to be placed in corridors and even store cupboards, with understaffed and overworked nursing teams forced to treat patients in crowded environments without easy access to life-saving equipment. The practice is undignified, unsafe and simply cannot go on. “The secretary of state must act with urgent investment to increase bed capacity and improve nurse staffing levels in hospitals, and, vitally, funding for community teams to enable people to be treated at home and away from overwhelmed hospitals."" Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Helen Morgan said: “A hospital stay is one of the most stressful and vulnerable situations any one of us can experience. It is utterly unacceptable that patients are being forced into mixed-sex wards – adding fuel to the fire of stress and worry. “Every patient deserves to be comfortable and to be treated with dignity and respect, not left in inappropriate conditions because wards are overflowing. “In the face of a winter crisis, this will only get worse. The government needs to bring forward an emergency package of extra social care places and more staffed beds or patients will continue to face unacceptable conditions.” A government spokesperson said: “The use of mixed-sex wards soared under the Tories, and are another sign of just how damaged the NHS became under their watch. “As we look to fix the harm they’ve done, we’ve been clear – the safety, dignity and privacy of patients is crucial, and NHS Trusts are expected to eliminate mixed-sex accommodation. “Even with high flu cases and demand for services at unprecedented levels, it is not acceptable for patients to share sleeping accommodation with members of the opposite sex, and trusts are reminded robustly on this point.""",The Independent,The Independent

The billionaire tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year over its claims there had been a rise in hate speech and disinformation on his website. In an interview with the Guardian on Friday, Mr Ahmed said the decision to sanction him had “never been about politics”, and pointed the finger at the social media companies he has sought to “hold accountable”.

Read our Kwanzaa has become a nationally recognized celebration of since its founding in 1966 and also is celebrated in countries with large African descendant populations. The holiday, which serves as a nationwide communal event reinforcing self-determination and unity in the face of oppression, spans seven days from the day after Christmas through New Year’s Day. It is observed in large, city-sponsored events as well as in smaller communities and homes across the nation. Kwanzaa has grown in popularity in the decades since its founding and is celebrated by 3% of the country, according to a 2019 AP-NORC survey. Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and all released statements commemorating the holiday, and in 1997, the U.S. Postal Service began issuing Kwanzaa stamps. It is not recognized as a federal holiday. Kwanzaa emerged during the Black Freedom Movement of the 1960s as a way to reconnect Black communities in the U.S. with important African cultural traditions that were severed by the trans- slave trade. It also promotes unity and liberation. “It was also shaped by that defining decade of fierce strivings and struggles for freedom, justice and associated goods waged by Africans and other peoples of color all over the world in the 1960s,” Maulana Karenga, the holiday’s founder, wrote in his annual Kwanzaa address in 2023. “Kwanzaa thus came into being, grounded itself and grew as an act of freedom, an instrument of freedom, a celebration of freedom and a practice of freedom.” Karenga, an African American author, activist and professor, founded Kwanzaa following the Watts Riots, also known as the Watts Rebellion, in Los Angeles in 1965. Karenga described Kwanzaa as a “political-motivator holiday” in an interview with Henry Lewis Gates Jr. for PBS. “The idea is for African and African descended people to come together around family, community and culture so we can be in spaces where, in Dr. Karenga’s words, we feel fully African and fully human at the same time,” said Janine Bell, president and artistic director at the Elegba Folklore Society in Richmond, Virginia. Many people who observe Kwanzaa, which is a secular holiday, celebrate it alongside religious festivals such as Christmas. of any faith, race or ethnic background can participate. The name Kwanzaa derives from “mutanda ya kwanza” a Swahili phrase meaning “first fruits” or “first harvest.” The final “a” was added to the name to accommodate the seven children present at the first Kwanzaa, each of whom was given a letter to represent. The holiday is governed by seven principles, known collectively as the Nguzo Saba, and a different principle is celebrated each day: Umoja (Unity), Kujichagulia (Self-Determination), Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility), Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics), Nia (Purpose), Kuumba (Creativity) and Imani (Faith). The Nguzo Saba is represented by a candleholder with seven candles called a kinara. Each night, one of those candles is lit. The candles are the same colors as the Kwanzaa flag: Black representing the people, red their struggle and green their hope. Large Kwanzaa celebrations happen across the country every year in cities including Los Angeles, Atlanta and Detroit. These events often feature storytellers, music and dance. The holiday is also observed in individual homes, often focusing on children because they are key to the survival of culture and the development of community. This concept of children and the future they embody is often represented symbolically by corn. “The intention is that it’s 365 (days a year),” Bell said. “The need for the principles and the strengthening value of the principles don’t go away on January 2nd.” Family celebrations also involve giving gifts and sharing African American and Pan African foods, culminating in the Karamu, a feast featuring dishes from across the African diaspora. Typical meals include staples of Southern cuisine like sweet potato pie or popular dishes from Africa like jollof rice. Activities over the seven days are geared toward reaffirming community bonds, commemorating the past and recommitting to important African cultural ideals. This can include dancing, reading poetry, honoring ancestors and the daily lighting of the kinara. ___ This story was first published on Dec. 19, 2024.",The Independent,The Independent

Four outrageous stories from Trump’s first year back that you may have forgotten about,2025-12-26T18:06:55.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our was engaged in a deliberate strategy to overwhelm the press and his critics by rolling out massive and controversial policy changes while distracting them with trolling to keep them from ever focusing on any one thing that could matter. He described the tactic as “flooding the zone.” “Every day, we hit them with three things. They'll bite on one, and we'll get all of our stuff done, bang, bang, bang,” he said. Nearly a year into Trump’s second term, their “flood the zone strategy” has been in full effect. His administration has unveiled sweeping changes to how America’s government operates in ways that have had and will have dramatic effects on how everyday people live for years to come. But those changes have come in such rapid-fire succession that nearly 365 days after Trump was sworn in on a freezing January day last year, it’s hard to even begin to remember what he’s done. Here are some of the wildest stories from the White House in 2025: of the independent inspectors general who root out waste, fraud and abuse within federal agencies and departments. The late-night purge removed the inspectors general at nearly every Cabinet-level agency without warning and in violation of a longstanding law requiring the president to notify Congress of his intent to fire any such official 30 days before actually doing so. Only the watchdogs at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security were permitted to remain in their jobs. Trump, who fired a number of inspectors general during his first term in an effort to kneecap their ability to investigate wrongdoing by his appointees, defended the illegal move as “very common” while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the first weekend golf outing of his second term. “I don’t know them … but some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing their job. It’s a very standard thing to do,” he said. The purge took out Senate-confirmed watchdogs at the departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Energy, Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, Small Business Administration and the Social Security Administration. The move allowed Trump fill the positions with loyalists. Less than a month in the White House, Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s trip was his first appearance there in quite some time, as Trump’s predecessor, former president , had declined to invite the Israeli leader due to election-year sensitivities around Israel’s brutal campaign of bombing civilian targets in Gaza to retaliate for the October 7, 2023, terror attacks by Hamas. Just weeks earlier, the Biden and Trump teams had shared credit for what was billed at the time as a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas, though the agreement quickly collapsed. But as Netanyahu stood beside him in the East Room, Trump offered up another plan for the war-torn territory that sent as the president claimed the U.S. would “take over” Gaza, displacing the 2.1 million Palestinians living there while the territory is rebuilt as “the Riviera of the Middle East.” The president’s shocking proposal to put the Gaza Strip — territory that Israel has occupied since the end of the 1967 Six-Day War — under American control came at the start of a madcap marathon press conference in the East Room following a bilateral meeting with Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted since returning to the White House last month. He claimed that “everybody” he had spoken to about the plan “loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.” “I've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different angle, and it's a very, very dangerous place to be, and it's only going to get worse. And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous ... praise. And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that,” Trump added. , with Saudi Arabia saying it “unequivocally rejected” the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, and Hamas branding the idea “ridiculous and absurd.” The White House walked back the idea less than a day later, and the president’s aborted plan was later superseded by the ceasefire agreement negotiated between Israel and Hamas with the aid of Egypt, Qatar and other regional powers in October. During his 2024 campaign against former Biden, and later former vice president Kamala Harris, Trump was fond of telling supporters that he would be their “retribution” if he was elected again. Since taking office, he’s made good on that promise in ways that critics say have strained the rule of law and undermined the independence of the Department of Justice. But Trump took an unprecedented step on his “retribution” tour in April by ordering the Department of Justice to investigate one of his most prominent first-term critics — for anything that can be found to investigate. , a veteran of multiple Republican administrations who served as chief of staff to then- Secretary John Kelly during the president’s first term. During that time, Taylor infamously penned an anonymous op-ed — and later a book — describing efforts by Trump administration personnel to shield the government from Trump’s worst instincts. White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said at the time that the order stripped Taylor “of any active clearance that he has in light of his past activities involving classified information” even though Taylor’s writings weren’t alleged to have included anything classified at all. “It's also going to order the Department of Justice to investigate his activities, to see what else might come up in that context, given his egregious behavior during your previous administration,” Scharf added. The same day, Trump signed a similar order directing a probe of Chris Krebs, the security expert who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during his first term. Krebs had incurred Trump’s ire in the immediate wake of the 2020 election — which Trump lost to Joe Biden — by stating publicly that the election was the most secure in the country’s 250-year history. He also said there was “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised” during the 2020 election, directly contradicting Trump’s false claims of fraud. That order further targeted Krebs’ employer, the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, by ordering the stripping of security clearances “held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.” Eight months later, neither Taylor nor Krebs has been accused of any crime, but Trump has continued to escalate his campaign of revenge against critics and adversaries by ordering the Justice Department to prosecute ex-FBI director James Comey and New York State Attorney General Letitia James, among others. Those efforts have thus far been stymied by federal judges who dismissed a pair of indictments against both Comey and James on the grounds that the ex-White House official who Trump installed as a prosecutor in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, had been unlawfully appointed. Less than a month after he swore to “preserve, protect and defend” the U.S. Constitution, Trump took to social media to push back against the myriad challenges to his blitzkrieg of executive actions and threats to federal agencies from the then-Elon Musk-ed Department of Government Efficiency by invoking a movie quote from a film about Napoleon, who justified his despotic regime as the will of the people of France. Writing on X and Truth Social on February 15, Trump said: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” had been swiftly blocked by federal courts across the country in the opening salvos of what has become a series of months-long legal battles, appeared to be lifting a line 1970 film Waterloo, in which actor Rod Steiger’s Napoleon states that he “did not ‘usurp’ the crown.” “I found it in the gutter, and I picked it up with my sword, and it was the people … who put it on my head,” he says. “He who saves a nation violates no law,” Steiger said. Four days later, Trump went even further by crowning himself “king” of his former home, New York City, after the Department of Transportation purported to order the withholding of federal funds to New York unless it nixed the congestion pricing plan that the Democratic-led city government implemented. “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,” he wrote February 19 on Truth Social. “ with a mock cover of Time magazine featuring a portrait of the president wearing a crown with the caption “long live the king.” Then-White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich also an AI-generated image of the president wearing a crown and regal cape. In response, ​​New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority sued Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and federal transportation officials, arguing the Trump administration unlawfully and “precipitously — and for blatantly political reasons— purported to ‘terminate’ the program, as then-candidate Trump proclaimed he would do in his first week in office.” A federal judge later blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds in retaliation for the congestion pricing scheme, and the MTA’s lawsuit seeking to permanently enjoin the administration from doing so remains ongoing.",The Independent,The Independent

Ewa Sokola was called as a witness to boost her claims, but ultimately ended up helping the defense. Now, Ewa Sokola is suing Kaja for defamation, alleging in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court that the psychotherapist and ex-model’s public remarks amount to libel and are damaging Ewa’s reputation and business as a cardiologist in Ewa Sokola says that her younger sister has made false statements subjecting her to public hatred, shame, contempt, ridicule, ostracism and disgrace in Wrocław, Poland. She seeks unspecified damages. Messages seeking comment were left for Kaja Sokola’s lawyers and spokesperson on Thursday and Friday. In a split verdict in June, Weinstein was convicted of forcibly performing oral sex on film and television production assistant and producer Miriam Haley and acquitted on a charge involving Kaja Sokola’s allegations of similar conduct. Both women said they were assaulted in 2006. The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further. Weinstein has not yet been sentenced as a judge weighs a defense request to throw out the verdict after two jurors told Weinstein’s lawyers that other jurors had bullied them into convicting him. Judge Curtis Farber is expected to rule on Jan. 8. Kaja Sokola has said her sister’s testimony at Weinstein's state court trial in earlier this year undermined her own testimony that he forced oral sex at a Manhattan hotel just before her 20th birthday. Weinstein had arranged for Kaja Sokola to be an extra for a day in the film “The Nanny Diaries,” and separately agreed to meet her and Ewa. After they chatted, she testified, Weinstein told her he had a script to show her in his hotel room, and she went up with him. There, she said, Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and assaulted her. After the trial, Kaja Sokola criticized her sister's testimony, saying that though she was called as a prosecution witness, she ended up serving Weinstein's cause by providing his lawyers with a journal in which she wrote about the men who had sexually assaulted her in her life but did not include Weinstein. According to the lawsuit, Kaja Sokola repeatedly characterized her sister's testimony as a personal “betrayal"" and falsely accused her of omitting journals in which she described what happened with Weinstein. The lawsuit also said Kaja Sokola had falsely accused Ewa Sokola of homicide, theft, falsification of medical records, sexual impropriety and immoral conduct, and of colluding with Weinstein's defense team.

Read our on Friday of targeting their forces with airstrikes, something not formally acknowledged by the kingdom after it warned the forces to withdraw from governorates they recently took over. , said the strikes happened in Yemen’s Hadramout governorate. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were any casualties from the strikes that further raise tensions in the war-torn nation and put at risk a fragile Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed rebels in the country’s north for a decade. Amr Al Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the Council, said in a statement to The Associated Press that its fighters had been operating in eastern Hadramout on Friday after facing “multiple ambushes” from gunmen. Those attacks killed two fighters with the Council and wounded 12 others, Al Bidh said. The Saudi airstrikes happened after that, he added. The Council later described their operations in the area as seeking a wanted man and trying to cut off smuggling through the area. Faez bin Omar, a leading member in a coalition of tribes in Hadramout, told the AP that he believed the strikes served as a warning to the Council to withdraw its fighters from the area. An eyewitness to the strikes, Ahmed al-Khed, said he saw destroyed military vehicles afterward, believed to belong to forces allied to the Council. The Council’s satellite channel AIC aired what appeared to be mobile phone footage it described as showing the strikes. In one video, a man speaking could be heard blaming the strike on Saudi aircraft. Officials in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a request for comment from the AP. However, the Saudi-owned, London-based newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, quoting “informed sources,” reported late Friday that the kingdom carried out the strikes “to send a message"" to the Council. “Any further escalation would be met with stricter measures,” the paper said. On Thursday, the kingdom called on the Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw. The Council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra. That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces, another group in the coalition fighting the Houthis. Those aligned with the Council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967-1990. Demonstrators rallied on Thursday in the southern port city of to support political forces calling for South Yemen to secede again from Yemen. Following the capture of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north by the Houthis in 2014, Aden has been the seat of power for the internationally recognized government and forces aligned against the rebels. The actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC oil cartel, but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years. The UAE said in a statement Friday that it “welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to support security and stability"" in Yemen. “The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavors aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen, contributing positively to regional security and prosperity,” it added. There has also been an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation on the , where the kingdom and the Emirates support opposing forces in that country’s ongoing war. The Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sanaa in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile. Iran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a U.N. arms embargo. A Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the globe’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The Houthis, meanwhile, have launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping. Further chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States. Washington launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that U.S. President Donald Trump halted just before his trip to the Middle East in October. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.

Read our on Friday approved a draft law to determine the extent of losses suffered by Lebanese banks during the country's financial meltdown in 2019 and provide a mechanism to return depositors' funds that were wiped out at the time. The financial collapse, which wiped out billions in savings and left many unable to access their funds, was part of a fiscal crisis that followed decades of corruption, financial mismanagement and nefarious profiteering. The draft legislation, which still has to be approved by parliament to become law, marked the first move by the government to try and return funds to individual depositors whose bank accounts were frozen. Thirteen ministers voted in favor and nine against the draft law, dubbed “financial gap law.” During the Cabinet meeting, a sit-in protest outside the government headquarters demanded action and expressed skepticism over the legislation. It remained unclear when Lebanon's parliament could take up the draft. Its passage in the assembly could face delays — a pattern seen with many previous efforts to reform the financial system. There has been an ongoing blame game over who is ultimately responsible for Lebanon’s economic crisis and the evaporation of people’s deposits. have blamed government corruption, while critics argue that the banks operated a Ponzi-like scheme, using new deposits to pay off earlier depositors rather than maintaining adequate reserves. The former central bank governor, Riad Salameh, who is wanted internationally on corruption charges, has claimed he consistently opposed such practices. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam issued a statement after the Cabinet meeting, promising that once the legislation is in place, smaller depositors — who “comprise 85% of depositors"" — will receive their full deposits over four years, while larger depositors will recover their money more gradually — first up to $100,000 in cash. The remainder of the large deposits will be converted into tradable bonds backed by the Central Bank’s revenues and assets, which total around $50 billion, Salam said. He rejected accusations that the bonds were “worthless,” adding that large depositors can recover a part of their funds every year. “For example, a depositor with $3 million could recover about $60,000 per year,” he said. Salam also said there was a clause in the law ensuring accountability, and denied claims the law was a “forgive and forget” measure.

Read our Hunt supporters have vowed to fight Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to ban trail hunting as thousands gathered to watch the traditional Boxing Day meetings. announced its intention to ban trail hunting just days before the traditional festive events and, despite a partial U-turn, there is still lingering resentment among farming communities over changes to inheritance tax breaks. pressure group said the Government had “alienated rural people”, with a poll suggesting 65% of voters think the Labour administration unfairly neglects country communities. On Friday, thousands of people turned out for the traditional Boxing Day meets across England to support the rural pastime. One of the largest meetings takes place on the Duke of Beaufort’s estate near , where thousands watched to see dozens of horses and fox hounds go trail hunting. Will Bryer, joint master of the Duke of Beaufort Hunt, said the countryside was “under assault and siege”, and said the Government would have a “fight” on its hands – warning it would get “messy”. “I just wonder whether our Government would have made that announcement had they predicted a turnout like this,” Mr Bryer said addressing the large crowd. “It is somewhat ironic, is it not, that the Government choose to announce their intentions to destroy trail hunting just at a time of year when we reaffirm our beliefs. “So just ask yourselves: Why did you come today? “Was it because you believe in a connection to the land and to your farmers? “Was it because you believe in preserving British cultural heritage? Was it because you believe in hunting? “So, we’re under assault, we’re under siege and like all fights it’s going to get messy. But we must, we must stand united. “So, because of my age, I’m going to say take the words from that 1980s super-ballad, take the words from Journey’s song, Don’t Stop Believing. Among the other meetings across the country was the Grove Rufford Hunt, which gathered in the main street in Bawtry, South Yorkshire, before more than 100 riders set out for the nearby village of Scaftworth. Speaking in the freezing sunshine outside The Crown Inn, chairman and master Jane Bowen said: “It’s a wonderful, wonderful turnout.” She said: “It just shows that the strength of popularity is still there despite all the bad press that we get.” Asked about the recent Government crackdown proposals, she said: “As we all know, they’re bombarding the farmers with lots of legislation, and they are against the rural communities, and we must hold tight and fight them back.” “They refuse to engage with us on any level. “And, if they come to visit the kennels, of which anybody is welcome at any time, and actually see and understand what we do, then I think they’ll have a different view. “We all have different views, that is the choice of a democracy, or was. And we choose to do this, and we do it legally, as we have for 20 years. Ms Bowen said: “We have adapted from 20 years. We’ve adapted our way with trail hunting and we have moved on. “And I wish the Government would do the same in respect of past histories. They’ve gone. That has happened. “We have adapted and evolved, and so should they. “We continue to carry on trail hunting, and we value our heritage and Britain’s heritage, and we are one of the last pieces of rural tapestry alive, and we all support that hugely. The Government’s new animal welfare strategy, launched shortly before Christmas, set out plans to ban trail hunting – where packs of hounds follow a scent laid for them – in response to concerns it is being used as a smokescreen for foxhunting. The Countryside Alliance defended the practice, introduced to comply with the Hunting Act 2004’s ban on pursuing foxes. The group claimed hunts contribute more than £100 million a year to the rural economy. The Government will launch a consultation in early 2026 on how to ban trail hunting. Countryside Alliance chief executive Tim Bonner said: “When said that he ‘wanted a new relationship with the countryside’ we all assumed he meant a better one, but in 18 months his Government has alienated rural people and created the clear impression that it does not care about the countryside. “Its warped priorities have put taxing family farms, raising rates for rural businesses and banning trail hunting above policies that would benefit rural people. “While the partial changes to the family farm tax are a step in the right direction, the Government must desperately learn the fundamental lesson of this policy debacle, which is that it needs to work with the rural community – not legislate against it. “The Government has a very long way to go to rebuild trust.” A poll by ORB International suggested only 36% of Britons agreed or strongly agreed the Labour Government cares about people who live in the countryside, while 76% said they believed the Government prioritised urban issues over rural ones. ORB surveyed 2,083 British adults online between December 12 and 14. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) defended its policies, pointing to its response to a review of the agricultural sector carried out by former National Farmers’ Union president Baroness Minette Batters. A Defra spokeswoman said: “This Government is committed to banning trail hunting, which is too often used as a cover for illegal fox hunting, and has strong public support across the country. “This builds on previous animal welfare reforms delivered by this Government, including giving police greater powers to prevent dog attacks on livestock, protecting farmers and animals alike. “The Batters Review highlighted the need for greater collaboration between industry, farmers and government — and that is exactly what we will do. “We have increased the individual inheritance tax threshold from £1 million to £2.5 million, meaning couples with estates of up to £5 million will pay no inheritance tax.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Asmik Grigorian is reaching a new low – in a positive way — and doing it on one of the world’s top stages. A star soprano, she will sing the title role next summer in Georges Bizet’s “ ,” a mezzo-soprano touchstone, at the Salzburg Festival. “I thought if I want to do ‘Carmen’ I need to do it now because I don’t want to do when I will be 54,” the 44-year-old Grigorian said ahead of a concert this weekend at Maria Callas, Leontyne Price, Jessye Norman and Angela Gheorghiu all recorded Carmen but never sang the complete role on stage. Ana María Martinez and Danielle de Niese are the most notable sopranos in recent years to have sung live performances of the famous seductress, while Victoria de los Ángeles took it on late in her career in the 1970s, and Geraldine Farrar and Rosa Ponselle performed it decades earlier. She debuts in the role in July 2026 Grigorian is to sing eight “Carmen” performances starting July 26 in a new production by Gabriela Carrizo with Jonathan Tetelman as Don José, Kristina Mkhitaryan as Micaëla, with Teodor Currentzis conducting the Utopia Orchestra. Opera's general manager Peter Gelb said. “She’s very much of a kind of old-school singer. She’s kind of fearless when it comes to taking on new repertoire.” Grigorian will be singing at Carnegie Hall on Saturday alongside Thomas Hampson, Sondra Radvanovsky, Nadine Sierra, Brian Jagde and Anita Monserrat, an unusually timed performance during a period when peripatetic singers often are home for the holidays. She is to join Hampson in the final scene from Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin,” an opera she is to perform at the Met starting April 20. Promoter Eugene Wintour, arranging his first U.S. event, wanted to pair stars who hadn't sung together before. Advance ticket sales at Carnegie were slow, and Wintour said he is planning another star-filled concert next year but before the holidays. “In Europe, Christmas and New Year’s concerts are sold out instantly,"" he said through a translator. “It’s a learning curve working here in the states.” Grigorian traveled Friday from Vilnius, Lithuania; to Zurich and then to New York, going straight from JFK International Airport to a rehearsal at Riverside Church. “I really promised myself that I’m not going to be away during Christmas because it’s the only day when all the family, we kind of collect ourselves to be in one place and this is a very, very important day for me,” she said. A daughter of tenor Gegham Grigorian, she made her opera debut in 2004 as Donna Anna in Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” in Norway and has since become one of the world’s leading dramatic sopranos. Her current season includes the title roles in Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot” and “Manon Lescaut,” and in Richard Strauss’ “Salome,” and she has tentatively planned Richard Wagner's “Tristan und Isolde” for the first time at the Vienna State Opera in 2029. While she has sung Micaëla, Carmen has a lower tessitura and breaking vocal fach boundaries can spark controversy. When Ponselle headlined “Carmen” at the Met for the first time in 1935, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: “We have never heard Miss Ponselle sing so badly.” “If you feel that you have the notes and you have the personality and you have the desire and you’re a star like Asmik or you’re a star like Ana María Martínez and a theater will give it to you, hallelujah,” soprano Lisette Oropesa said. Martínez made her debut as Carmen in 2014 at the Houston Grand Opera at the behest of Anthony Freud, the company's general director from 2006-11. “The most intimidating aspect of ‘Carmen’ is nothing vocal. ... It’s much more about commanding the stage."" Martínez said. ""Asmik is going to just be incredible in the role simply because of her presence on stage and her magnetism.” Grigorian's first performance as Carmen is expected to draw considerable attention in the classical music world. ""I started to live that role day by day a bit,” she said. “I never know if I can sing something before I start to do it, so maybe it will be my failure? Who knows?

But, the push to cut states out of the regulatory process has earned major pushback from MAHA and other food safety advocates. “A federal standard favors large multinational companies with a lot of money to lobby for less restrictive standards,” Jennifer Galardi, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, who researches MAHA-aligned issues, told . “We see a state-by-state approach as emulating the checks and balances that our federalist system was designed to produce.” Melanie Benesh, a vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit focused on human health, said barring states from regulating food would be the “worst thing” in terms of boosting food safety, claiming the industry leaders are engaged in a cynical ploy. “This isn’t about affordability,” she told the outlet. “This is about maintaining the status quo.” Multiple studies have shown that ultra-processed foods are associated with a range of negative health effects. A 2024 review of 45 meta-analyses covering millions of participants concluded that diets high in ultra-processed foods increase the risk of death from by 50 percent, obesity by 55 percent and type 2 diabetes by 40 percent.

On Friday, Mr Ahmed said the influence of big tech firms, including Mr Musk’s platform, was behind the bid to remove him from the US, where he is a legal permanent resident. , he said the sanctions were “actually a story about the corrupting influence of big tech and big money in Washington”. He described the tech firms as “arrogant”, “indifferent to the harm they cause” and “sociopathic in their greed”. Asked whether he thought UK politicians should continue to use X, he told PA: “Politicians have to make decisions for themselves, but every time they post on X, they are putting a buck in Mr Musk’s pocket and I think they need to question their own consciences and ask themselves whether or not they think they can carry on doing that.” adviser, has previously found himself in conflict with big tech, and particularly Mr Musk, who sued CCDH unsuccessfully last year over its claims there had been a rise in hate speech and disinformation on his website.

Sarah Rogers, the US undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, said Mr Ahmed was sanctioned because he was a “key collaborator” with Joe Biden’s administration’s efforts to “weaponise the government” against US citizens. She said the CCDH had called for social media sites to “de-platform” anti-vaccine campaigners – including the now health secretary Robert F Kennedy – and had backed measures, including the UK’s Online Safety Act, “to expand censorship” around the world.

Here are some things to know about the Powerball jackpot and what happens next. The winning ticket was sold at a Murphy USA gas station in Cabot, a suburb northeast of Little Rock with a population of about 27,000 people. A telephone message left at the store on Friday was not returned, but a spokesperson for the company, Alejandra Barron, said in an email their stores were particularly busy on Christmas Eve with shoppers purchasing Powerball tickets. It is the second time a major jackpot was won at a Murphy USA store.

Under Arkansas law, lottery winners of prizes of more than $500,000 can request that their identity remains confidential for up to three years, after which the information is no longer exempt from disclosure. However, if the winner is an elected official or a close relative, those records remain confidential for only 6 months. Lottery proceeds are subject state individual income tax in Arkansas, where the top rate is 3.9%. If the winner selects the lump sum cash payment option of $834.9 million, they would owe the state of Arkansas more than $32 million. Arkansas law also authorizes overdue taxes, delinquent child support and any other judgments or liens to be withheld from lottery winnings if that person has such outstanding debts. The winning numbers were 04, 25, 31, 52 and 59, with the Powerball number being 19. The last time someone won a Powerball jackpot on Christmas Eve was in 2011, Powerball said. The company added that the sweepstakes has been won on Christmas Day four times, most recently in 2013. Powerball’s odds of 1 in 292.2 million are designed to generate big jackpots, with prizes growing as they roll over when no one wins. Lottery officials made the odds tougher in 2015 to create those humongous jackpots, although officials note the odds are far better for the game’s many smaller prizes.

Abrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Abrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him.

At that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.

According to the complaint, Rodriguez was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym in Los Angeles who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged Rodriguez to audition for “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” telling him, “I’m not a bad person to know and have in your corner,” the lawsuit claims.

Read our Newsmax, the right-wing network known for its over-the-top pro-Trump coverage, has seemingly taken a side in the brewing MAGA civil war that was sparked by “What happened to Tucker?!” Newsmax host John Huddy exclaimed Friday while interviewing a former Israel Defense Forces soldier, who would go on and accuse Carlson of peddling “Jew hatred” because he is suffering a “crisis of faith” after Fox News fired him. Meanwhile, the conservative cable channel repeatedly praised Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro for during Turning Point USA’s year-end AmericaFest conference, which saw the intraparty rift over Israel and accusations of antisemitism laid bare. In fact, Newsmax brought on Rabbi Steven Burg multiple times to talk about that lauded Shapiro for his “moral courage” in “calling out right-wing antisemitism at Turning Point USA.” Burg, for his part, took aim at Carlson for his “just asking questions” style – especially during his recent Fuentes interview. “I think that specifically what Tucker Carlson is doing is horrific,” Berg said on Friday morning, adding that “evil is also standing by and saying nothing while you're watching things happen.” Meanwhile, the network also noted throughout its coverage this week that a conservative Jewish civil rights group Friday, “Newsmax condemns antisemitism or racism espoused by anyone no matter their political affiliation."" Over the past year, there have been flashpoints between different wings of the Republican Party over the direction of Donald Trump’s administration and the MAGA movement in general, whether it was the , the bombing of Iran or the issue over H1-visas. However, with fractures growing wider between factions of the “America First” coalition over the Israel-Gaza War, Carlson’s friendly sitdown with Fuentes – a notorious Holocaust denier who leads a trollish group of racist followers known as “groypers” – was something of a seismic event for the GOP. After the president of influential conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation Carlson against the “venomous coalition” and “globalist class” trying to “cancel” him, the organization soon found itself in , though he did not back down, telling his critics to while receiving support from former Fox News colleague Megyn Kelly. Owens would throw more fuel on the fire with her wild theories about the assassination of Kirk, the conservative activist and founder of right-wing youth organization TPUSA. Owens, who was once close friends with Kirk and TPUSA’s communications director, that Israeli government agents could have killed him over his shifting views on Gaza, and that TPUSA staffers may have been involved in his murder. After Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, called on Owens to “stop” peddling her conspiracies, Kelly – who has refused to denounce Owens – said she arranged a private meeting between the two women to discuss the situation. Since that sitdown, Owens has since doubled down on her claims and Kelly has on Carlson, Owens (who once worked for Shapiro), Kelly and former Trump strategist turned MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon, calling them “grifters and frauds” while blasting their moral “cowardice.” Bannon, Carlson and Kelly would all return fire from the TPUSA stage later in the event. With lines being drawn in the MAGA sand in recent days, and even the Trump administration and trying to get their most popular influencers to stop “canceling each other” over “self-defeating purity tests,” Newsmax weighed in this week and essentially declared it was on Shapiro’s side. “Now, as far as we know, Tucker Carlson is not a member of the clergy. But he told the crowd that antisemites have a right to a platform for their hate speech because they, quote, have a soul,” morning anchor Krysia Lenzo said to Burg on Friday. “So, as a rabbi, how do you respond to Carlson, who seems to feel that giving antisemites a platform is a god-given right?” Calling it “the most absurd thing in the world,” Burg went on to note that Adlof Hitler and Josef Stalin “had a soul” but then “killed many millions of people” before accusing Carlson of poisoning the minds of America’s youth. “He's just giving a platform to people that traffic in conspiracy theories that are totally absurd,” Burg declared. “And it's going to destroy the country because you have young people who are listening to these things and treating it as fact.” Guest host TW Shannon, meanwhile, said to “follow the dollar” because “we know that there are extreme Muslim terrorist groups that actually promote this type of hate from both the left and the right.” That appeared to be a nod towards allegations made by self-appointed Trump “loyalty enforcer” Laura Loomer and Fox News host Mark Levin that During his late morning interview with former IDF soldier Benjamin Anthony, Huddy – who was once Carlson’s colleague at Fox News – tore into the one-time primetime star, as well as Owens, Fuentes and Kelly. “It’s a dangerous trend that we’re seeing with Candace Owens, who everything that comes out of her mouth – I’m sorry, I’m going to take off my journalist hat – but it's just rubbish. It’s terrible! It’s antisemitic! Same with Nick Fuentes.” Adding that Carlson is “not backing down on this,” he claimed Carlson said “antisemites have a right to a platform for their hate speech” because they have souls, expressing indignation over the right-wing pundit’s supposed position. “No, they do not! Not when they’re spewing lies, fabrications and hate, I don’t think they do and I think they should be called out,” Huddy fumed. “My question is, a lot of people have asked, ‘What happened to Tucker?’ What’s behind this because he wasn’t always like that. We didn’t hear this kind of antisemitic and this anti-Israel theme coming from him, coming from Megyn Kelly,” he continued before “I have my suspicions and it kind of goes back to Qatar and some of the influence that Qatar is having in the western world, in the United States, in Europe with social media,” Huddy wondered. “But what do you think? Why do you think this has happened with guys like him and Megyn Kelly?” , openly speculated that Carlson has “finally got license to say what’s on his heart” because he’s now a “YouTuber” and in the “wild West of media,” adding that a “crisis of faith” was created by Carlson’s sudden termination from Fox News in 2023. “I think that Tucker Carlson is reacting to a disruptive event in his life – him being dismissed from Fox News,” Anthony asserted. “And I think, quite frankly, he – as is often the case among weak-minded individuals – looks around for someone to blame other than himself and what does he say? Rupert Murdoch carries the water for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I’m now going to attack Benjamin Netanyahu, the Jewish state and, yes, the Jewish people.” This isn’t the first time that Newsmax has attempted to marginalize Carlson amid right-wing criticism of the ex-Fox News host. Earlier this summer, Newsmax personalities and guests began telling its audience – and one viewer in particular – that Carlson had against the White House over America joining Israel’s short-lived war against Iran. At the time, Trump labeled Carlson – a longtime ally who helped convince him to choose JD Vance as his running mate – “kooky Tucker” while mockingly referencing the commentator’s unceremonious exit from Fox News. Newsmax’s condemnation of Carlson, however, is more than a little ironic considering that it was just two years ago that the network made a play for Fox News’ much larger conservative audience by shamelessly courting Carlson after the Murdoch-owned outlet fired the host. In the days after Carlson’s termination, Newsmax mentioned Carlson’s name on the air to the situation, which generally featured conservative guests railing against Fox News for letting him go. With Newsmax suddenly seeing a spike in ratings, the network an “urgent poll” asking viewers if “it was right for Fox News to fire Tucker Carlson” and whether they “want Tucker back on cable TV.” that the network’s CEO Chris Ruddy wasn’t just offering Carlson his own primetime Newsmax show, but he also floated the idea of having him program the entire channel in order to sweeten the deal. Network executives also made it clear at the time that “they would basically give him a big say in rebranding their channel.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our The attorneys for the man accused of killing rap icon in 1996 are pushing to suppress evidence obtained in what they claim was an “unlawful nighttime search.” criminal defense attorneys Robert Draskovich and William Brown filed a motion this week on behalf of their client, Duane “Keffe D” , who was charged in the drive-by shooting of the iconic rapper off the Las Vegas Strip. Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a “misleading portrait” of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer to grant the execution of a search warrant at night, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as if there’s a risk that evidence will disappear if officers wait until morning. In reality, Davis, an ex-gang leader from Southern California, had left the narcotics trade in 2008 and began doing inspection work for oil refineries, his attorneys say. He was a 60-year-old retired cancer survivor with adult children and grandchildren and had been living with his wife in Henderson, a city outside of Las Vegas, for nine years at the time the warrant was executed. “The court wasn’t told any of this,” his attorneys wrote in the motion. “As a result, the court authorized a nighttime search based on a portrait of Davis that bore little resemblance to reality — a clearly erroneous factual determination, in other words.” — which conducted the search and collected Davis' electronic devices, “purported marijuana” and tubs of photographs — declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation. At the time of the search, police said executing the warrant under the cover of darkness would allow officers to surround and secure the residence, and that if Davis barricaded himself, the darkness would allow officers to evacuate the surrounding homes with the least exposure to residents. Davis was arrested in September 2023. He pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and sought to be released since shortly after his arrest. His attorneys claim Davis’ arrest stems from false public statements Davis had made in which he claimed to be present in the white from which Shakur was shot. They say he has never offered details that would firmly corroborate his presence in the car, and that he benefited from saying he was present. He dodged drug charges by telling the story in a proffer agreement, and he has made money by repeating it in documentaries and his 2019 book, according to his attorneys. “Think of it this way: Shakur’s murder was essentially the entertainment world’s JFK assassination — endlessly dissected, mythologized, monetized — so it’s not hard to see why someone in Davis’s position might falsely place himself at the center of it all for personal gain,” his attorneys wrote.",The Independent,The Independent

A majority of SNP MSPs, the First Minister has said, should be enough for to be granted the powers to hold another vote on independence, as it was ahead of the 2014 vote. Holyrood’s system makes it extremely difficult for parties to secure a majority of MSPs, having been set up to ensure groups have to work together to pass legislation. But speaking to the Press Association, Mr Sarwar – who is vying to be First Minister after May’s election himself – has poured scorn on the SNP’s push. “John Swinney is duping his own membership, his own supporters and his own candidates,” he said. , when the SNP were up above 50% in the opinion polls, when her approval ratings were at plus 58%, when she was claiming to be Mother Teresa, couldn’t win a majority, the idea that this guy, who has been at the centre of the Government for the last 18 years, low energy, no ideas John Swinney, is somehow pretending that he is going to energise the masses and win a majority government in Scotland is for the birds.” Labour’s fortunes have fallen in the polls since the election last year, seemingly owing to unpopular policies from the UK Government. Mr Sarwar acknowledged there had been “challenges”, but claimed that had made the First Minister and the SNP “complacent and arrogant”. “I think once the focus of people in Scotland are on the performance of this Government and the choice they face in May 2026, I think he is going to be utterly exposed.” Mr Sarwar would not be drawn on whether a majority should be enough for another independence referendum, saying only: “John Swinney is not going to win a majority, he’s not going to be First Minister after May.” The Scottish Labour leader and his team have sought to isolate the election campaign north of the border from the Government south of the border in recent months, with Mr Sarwar giving his usual answer to questions of the impact of UK-wide policy on his chances, saying: “ “Rachel Reeves is not standing to be First Minister. “The two people credibly standing to be First Minister (are) me and John Swinney.” He went on to urge Scots to use their vote in May on Scottish issues rather than on the record of the UK Government. “Regardless of what people might think about the rights and wrongs of a UK Labour Government, it is not right to use our election in Scotland as an election of protest, somehow pretending that what we choose as a Government in Scotland does not have consequence,” he said. “If you care about your school, your local hospital, local services, local transport, regional development, they’re all the responsibility of the Scottish Government and not the responsibility of the UK Labour Government. “John Swinney will want to make it about ministers somewhere else. “I’m going to make this election about Scotland and I’m confident if this election is about Scotland, people will choose that new direction.” Responding to the Labour leader, Mr Swinney told PA: “I think I’m demonstrating that I’m getting Government focused on the priorities of the public. “The health service is delivering a performance that’s now seeing waiting lists fall as a consequence of the leadership I give the health service, child poverty is now at its lowest level for 30 years in Scotland – that’s not happened by accident.” He added: “We’ve got the ideas, the energy, the commitment, the drive and the vision to deliver a better Scotland and that’s what I’m going to set out to the public.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our shaking Gerry Adams’ hand at a Belfast reception held as part of the US president’s historic visit in 1995. The annual release of documents from the National Archives in and US officials to co-ordinate the Clintons’ visit to the island of Ireland. It included discussions on whether the Clintons should stay in as part of the visit, and a genealogy expert researching Mr Clinton’s ancestry, concluding that the suggestion his ancestors were from Co Fermanagh was based “on fantasy” although they may have come from a separate part of Ulster. The Clintons visited Northern Ireland in 1995 before travelling to Dublin. A reception was organised at Whitla Hall at Queens University in Belfast for November 30. A letter from the Irish joint secretary of the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, David Donoghue, sent to Sean O hUiginn at the Anglo-Irish Division, said that “the Americans” originally wanted to hold the reception and “confine” it to 120 people. He said the British side “insisted” that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Patrick Mayhew, should host it, which was agreed, and the guest list was expanded to 300 people. “The ostensible intention is to enable the president to meet a wider range of people in Northern Ireland” he wrote on November 28 1995. “The real purpose, of course, is to de-emphasise the political nature of the occasion and to create a broader ‘community’ event which, the British calculate, will make it easier for unionists to attend alongside Sinn Fein.” Mr Donoghue said that the representatives would form “pods” at the reception – “a UUP pod, an Alliance pod etc” – determined on a “pro rata basis in light of respective electoral strengths”. “In other words, each will form a distinct cluster of people to whom the president will be introduced in turn (on the lines of Buckingham Palace receptions).” He also said that Peter Bell, from the Northern Ireland Office, had indicated “the Americans would prefer to avoid a handshake photograph between the president and Adams”. He also said that while one-on-one meetings had been planned with John Hume in Derry and David Trimble in a car journey after the reception at Queens, there was a “general US reluctance” to meet one-on-one with Adams, Ian Paisley, or John Alderdice. “The general assumption, however, is that the president will take relevant individuals aside for separate private conversations on the margins of the reception.” The two men shook hands for the first time in March of that year at the White House, as part of events held to mark St Patrick’s Day – but after photographers had left the room. Mr Clinton was reportedly put under pressure at the time from then British prime minister John Major not to give Mr Adams a warm embrace at the luncheon, according to the New York Times. On the morning of November 30, before the reception in Belfast that evening, Mr Clinton met Mr Adams on the Falls Road in Belfast. As he left his car he paused to shake Mr Adams’s hand – a moment captured by an official White House photographer. Mr Clinton would later say of the handshake that it was a “big deal” and it felt at the time as though “the pavement was about to crack open”. Plans for the Clintons visit to Dublin, from December 1-2 1995, show that a US embassy official estimated that there was a “50/50” chance the visit would go ahead. An Irish genealogy expert also said claims that Clinton had Cassidy ancestors, who were from Co Fermanagh, were “based largely on fantasy” – but the White House still wanted Cassidy aspects added to the visit. It had been claimed that Mr Clinton had Irish ancestry through his mother, Virginia Cassidy. Genealogist Sean Murphy, from Bray, Co Wicklow, undertook the task of tracing Bill Clinton’s Irish ancestry after “media dissemination of claims concerning the president’s Irish ancestry which proved to be baseless, yet were left un-contradicted by any authoritative source”. He told the taoiseach’s office that the earliest trace of the president’s maternal ancestors of this line is “probably” Zachariah Cassidy, born in about 1750-60 in South Carolina, and his son Levi. “The Cassidy ‘clan’ claim that the earliest ancestor was a Luke or Lucas Cassidy of Roslea, Co Fermanagh, appears to be based largely on fantasy,” he wrote on October 16. “The biblical forenames Zachariah and Levi suggest a Protestant, and probably Presbyterian or Dissenter, as opposed to Catholic origin, and it is reasonable to speculate that the Cassidys would have been most likely to have emigrated to America from an Ulster county.” In notes of a meeting with the US embassy held three days later, Irish officials said that a planned stop off in Lismore, Co Fermanagh, was being dropped, but the White House was “still interested in using the Cassidy connection in a low-key way”. They said this could mean “‘casually’ passing a Cassidy premises”. Mr Clinton would go on to visit Cassidy’s Bar in Dublin for an hour during the 1995 trip. – This article is based on documents contained in the file labelled 2025/115/827 in the National Archives of Ireland.",The Independent,The Independent

The files note that Charles’s camp saw coverage of the visit to Ireland “as part of a long-term public relations strategy to rehabilitate the Prince in the eyes of the British public” after the high-profile split. Charles’s press team, led by press secretary Alan Percival and his successor Sandy Henney, had reported to Irish officials that they felt the visit to Ireland was “the best public outing the Prince has had in a very long time”. Ms Henney was described in the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs’ document as “fiercely loyal” to and “alive to every opportunity to advance his cause”. A Department of Foreign Affairs note shows officials were unsure if she was joking when she suggested that Diana may also want to visit Ireland. “Henney (who would have been less aware of the political dimension than the more restrained Percival) told me that if she had any say in it the Prince would be here again before the summer was out,” according to the document. “She also remarked that if practice to date was any guide we could shortly expect an approach from Princess Diana!” Department of Foreign Affairs official Joe Hayes added: “I took this as a joke until she repeated it and assured me that in the media battle between the two, the Princess was by far the more predatory and skilled and her staff devoted a great deal of time to finding ways and means of upstaging St James’ Palace.” Charles’ officials agreed with the Irish diplomats that coverage of the visit in the UK was, while positive, “relatively light” compared with that in Ireland.

Read our Justice minister was like “being in the House of Commons”, according to state documents which show that Padraig Flynn took UK officials to task on co-operation over Northern Ireland. In September 1992, Mr Flynn was exercised by a range of security issues as well as a lack of clarity from Mr Major’s government on the place of Northern Ireland in the Irish Constitution. The dispute has been revealed in a confidential note on a meeting in which has been made public as part of the annual release from the National Archives of Ireland. and Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mayhew as well as Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, Mr Flynn expressed concern that there had been an escalation of Loyalist paramilitary violence in the absence of meetings of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference. Prior to this meeting, Mr Major had held an hour-long tete-a-tete with Mr Reynolds where the Prime Minister had contended that co-operation on security matters had been better than it had ever been. However, that assessment was challenged when Mr Flynn and Mr Mayhew joined the leaders. The Justice Minister raised several issues including the closure of cross-border roads, the rebuilding of a British military watchtower near Cloghogue school, and a preference for mobile patrols over permanent vehicle checkpoints. In a record by an Irish civil servant which is not meant to be considered verbatim, Mr Flynn said he did not wish to “intrude a discordant note” but contended that cooperation with the Anglo-Irish Secretariat had decreased due to the break of meetings in the Conference. Mr Major told him not to worry about being discordant and assured him matters would be looked at. Mr Mayhew said that his officials had been “tied up” in talks with Northern Ireland political parties, but said there “will be no lack of co-operation”. The Prime Minister joked that this meant officials who had been working 16 hours a day would now be working 24 hours a day. On the checkpoints and closure of roads, Mr Mayhew said the official advice was that they were all necessary for security purposes. Mr Major asked Mr Mayhew if he wanted to get his “own back” towards Mr Flynn, to which the Northern Ireland Secretary replied: “No, Prime Minister – not long ago I would have wanted to.” The Justice Minister said the talks with Northern Ireland political parties were “sniffing around the mulberry bush” but “going nowhere”. had previously absented himself from the talks but still reserved the right to return to negotiations for the purpose of insisting on a change in the Irish Constitution’s territorial claim to the whole island of Ireland. Mr Major said he did not want to see the talks derailed: “You have to deal with the Unionists in these talks but I deal with them every day. We must not lose sight of what you and I want to see come out of these talks.” Mr Flynn said “it is not helpful when Her Majesty’s Government says that the Irish Constitution must be changed” and said there had been a hope that Mr Mayhew would have been able to use influence to pressure unionists on the issue. “Let us not get into double speak here. Let us be clear: If the Unionists feel comfort from your or that a change in the Constitution is possible, there will be misunderstanding.” The Northern Ireland Secretary said he wished it was true that he had influence over unionists, contending that they only hang on his words because they feel they are about to be betrayed. This sentiment was shared by Mr Major who told Mr Flynn that he may feel the UK Government has “more control over the Unionists than we have”. The Justice Minister said he, along with his Fianna Fail party and founder Eamon de Valera, had “been insulted” during the party talks and sought a commitment to a strong Government-to-Government foundation on the matters of the constitution. Mr Major reiterated his Government’s sincerity and attempted the resolve the row amicably: “I don’t mind being shouted at – it is quite like the House of Commons. “Let us agree we are going to do this – but you must not go away with suspicions about us.” Apparently still in good humour, the Prime Minister ended that meeting by saying they would now “go meet the reptiles” – in reference to the press gathered in the courtyard outside. – This article is based on documents contained in the file labelled 2023/50/204 in the National Archives of Ireland.",The Independent,The Independent

Mr Powell said that the British authorities were “pretty certain that it was the IRA” and that it was undertaken by people who were “very close to the Sinn Fein leadership”. He said that while the PSNI hoped to be in a position to make arrests in the time ahead, he “feared that the ‘top man’ involved would be clever enough to avoid being arrested”. He also expected that the DUP would “go on the rampage” once then PSNI Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde attributed responsibility. “Powell feared that the robbery would have proceeded even if the deal had been done with the DUP,” the note states. Mr Collins said that it was “almost incomprehensible” that planning for the heist was taking place while the Sinn Fein leadership was involved in negotiations. “The assessment on the Irish side was that the IRA remains a unified organisation; the Northern Bank was not a solo run.” The two sides noted that while there were “fissures” in the IRA ceasefire, they were no longer recruiting in the Republic, and the organisation was becoming a “more concentrated group of able people”. Mr Powell also said that while the heist was a “serious set-back”, there was a need to keep the process going and then prime minister Tony Blair was “not prepared to give up on the process”. “However, the republican movement had knocked up the price,” the note said. “Something categoric on criminality would now have to be part of the deal.” There were two outstanding issues, of criminality and the transparency dimension of decommissioning. Mr Collins suggested that the two governments could “stand back” from transparency and a process of third party mediation or conciliation “might, over time, identify a way forward”. British civil servant Jonathan Phillips was “sceptical a third party engagement would succeed”. Mr Powell also said that the British would not demilitarise in return for IRA arms decommissioning, but would demilitarise “in a house-keeping way” as it wanted to scale back its presence in Northern Ireland. “The British Government was not really interested in decommissioning; its priority was ending paramilitary activity and criminality.” – This article is based on documents contained in the file labelled 2025/127/90 in the National Archives of Ireland.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Sir Keir Starmer’s future could be determined in May as a polling expert warned Labour faces nationwide losses at next year’s elections. Robert Hayward said the Prime Minister was on course for heavy losses in English council elections, as well as defeat in the Welsh Senedd and a “battering” in the Scottish Parliament on May 7 2026. Bleak results for Labour could reignite the question of whether Sir Keir should continue to lead the party, which exploded into the headlines in November following anonymous briefing from his allies against potential rivals. In England, results will depend on where elections go ahead, with a number of councils expected to defer polls to 2027 to focus on a reorganisation of local government. and other metropolitan areas in Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire are set to go ahead. While these areas have recently been Labour-dominated, Lord Hayward said the party was on course for “very, very large” losses to Reform UK, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and, in east London, pro-Gaza Independent candidates. Even the Conservatives could pick up seats in London, he said, although the Tories’ overall result will depend heavily on whether elections go ahead in counties where they won heavily in 2021 but now face major losses. Gains in London councils such as Westminster or Barnet could help shore up Kemi Badenoch’s position as Conservative leader, which has come to seem more secure in recent months as her personal polling improves. Lord Hayward, a Conservative peer, said: “A few months ago it looked as if May 7 would be decisive for the leaderships of both Labour and Conservatives. “As we move into 2026 it now looks as if the May elections could decide the fate of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, but it is less clear that that will be the case for He added that while Labour and possibly the Conservatives were on course to lose seats in May, there would be no clear victor, but a “cacophony of winners”. Reform, starting from a low base, is likely to make the most gains, Lord Hayward said, but a range of other parties are expected to claim some sort of victory on the night, with a clear picture perhaps only emerging in the days following the election. Despite what could be significant changes in England, Lord Hayward suggested it was the results in Scotland and Wales that could have the most long-term significance for the UK. Last year, Labour had been expecting to supplant the But that prospect now seems unlikely, with Lord Hayward suggesting the party was on course for “one hell of a battering” while the SNP, the Greens and Reform could do well. In Wales, the picture is more complicated given the change in the electoral system, the increase in the size of the Senedd and the lowering of the voting age to 16. Especially in light of the Caerphilly by-election in October 2025, Plaid Cymru and Reform are in line to do well at Labour’s expense. Success for the SNP and Plaid Cymru could have constitutional implications beyond the impact of the elections on Labour’s leadership. The SNP is likely to reopen calls for another independence referendum if it wins a majority in Holyrood, while major gains for Plaid Cymru could see more vocal demands for greater devolution to Wales.",The Independent,The Independent

Additionally, 11 per cent of drinkers expressed a desire to enhance their mental health and wellbeing or boost their physical fitness. Alcohol Change UK’s chief executive Dr Richard Piper said: “Given the current pressure on our personal finances, we’re not surprised to see that saving money is the top motivator for taking a break from alcohol in January. “People are often shocked to hear estimates of what an average drinker spends on alcohol, which our research suggests is more than £62,000 over a lifetime – that’s a lot of holidays, more than a brand new car or a big chunk off our mortgage. “Even on a day-to-day basis, our drinking habits add up, and we can easily find ourselves spending more money on alcohol than we’d like – often without us really noticing until we step back and take a break. “In fact, many members of our community who are actively changing their relationship with alcohol report being surprised by how much money they’re saving in a short period of time, or in other words just how much they were spending on booze beforehand.” A total of £1.55 billion has been saved since 2018 by drinkers who used the charity’s Try Dry app along with other online tools and groups to take part in Dry January, researchers found. A closer look at figures from the app which tracks units drunk, calories and money saved while enabling drinkers to log dry days and get tips, found that drinkers also cut their alcohol consumption by 258 million units. This is around 129 million pints of average strength beer or medium glasses of wine which amounts to approximately two units per drink. They also avoided 16.2 billion empty calories – which is equivalent to around 80 million 200-calorie chocolate bars. Some 31 per cent of UK drinkers said they had concerns about the long-term damage their alcohol consumption might be doing to them, a survey of 2,000 people carried out by Censuswide also found. They also felt that alcohol may be negatively affecting their appearance, fitness, sleep and physical health and 52 per cent of drinkers said they had taken steps to manage their intake in the past year. Public health minister Ashley Dalton said: “It’s fantastic that millions of people will be taking positive steps towards better health and wellbeing in the New Year. “As we work to build a healthier nation through our 10 Year Health Plan, initiatives like the Dry January challenge remind us that prevention starts with the choices we make every day, and the evidence shows it can lead to lasting changes. “Whether it’s improving sleep, boosting mental health or saving money, taking a break from alcohol can make a real difference to our lives.” Regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week risks damaging your health, the NHS website states.

Read our to recognise a former British protectorate in a bid to take on terrorism in the Middle East. has unilaterally recognised the disputed state of Somaliland, which is seen as crucial in tackling the Houthi threat in the Red Sea and Strait of Aden, where Iranian-sponsored Houthi terrorists have been attacking shipping. It means Israel is the first country to officially recognise after it declared independence 34 years ago in 1991. Only Ethiopia has previously held an agreement with the previously unrecognised state in the Horn of Africa. It comes as US President Trump is under pressure to recognise the breakaway African state, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, after a bitter civil war, with the UK under pressure to follow suit. Within hours of Israel’s historic decision South Sudan also followed also recognised Somaliland. Mr Netanyahu, who has launched attacks on the Houthis in the region, said that the decision to recognise Somaliland was “in the spirit of the Abraham Accords”. Mr Netanyahu congratulated Somaliland president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Abdirahman Cirro, in a video call, praising his “leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace” and inviting him to visit Israel. He added: “The State of Israel plans to immediately expand its relations with the Republic of Somaliland through extensive cooperation in the fields of agriculture, health, technology, and economy.” that the move was to build on efforts to “tackle Iran and its allies in the region”, including the Houthis. Significantly it also follows the decision by a number of western countries in the UK and France to controversially recognise Palestine. Somaliland gained its independence from the UK on June 26 1960, but days later, on July 1 1960 united with the neighbouring former Italian colony to create Somalia. After three decades of civil war and brutality, where English was banned in schools and thousands of people from Somaliland were forced to flee, the former British protectorate declared independence again in 1991 and has been running its own affairs since. The UK, under former prime minister David Cameron, came close to formal recognition in 2012 but agreed to wait for recognition from African states first. Opposition to recognising Somaliland has come from Democrat administrations led by Barack Obama and, more recently, Joe Biden, who both sided strongly with Somalia’s claim over the territory. This is despite concerns that Somalia has remained unstable and has been a centre for piracy and terrorist activity, while Somaliland has wanted to be allied with Western interests and has successfully held democratic elections. Trump, though, has taken a different view with Somaliland’s port Berbera seen as a crucial base for tackling piracy and terrorist attacks in the Red Sea and Strait of Aden. Netanyahu’s move is expected to change the balance of diplomatic power in the Horn of Africa and threatens to isolate Somalia further. The Israeli prime minister’s decision was endorsed by Nigel Farage in the UK who posted on X: “Somaliland deserves this status.” One of the strongest advocates for Somaliland recognition is former UK defence secretary Gavin Williamson, who has honorary citizenship of the country. He is one of a number of senior parliamentarians who have been pushing for a change of the 34-year impasse maintained by the Foreign Office. He said: “It is important that the UK and the US move quickly to recognise Somaliland so that we can work with them as key strategic allies to bring peace and stability to the Red Sea and beyond.”",The Independent,The Independent

Earlier in December, Downing Street said the government was still in “active conversations” with the US on the tech deal. But the prime minister’s spokesman acknowledged that “negotiations of this kind are never straightforward”. Reports suggested US negotiators had become frustrated by slow progress in agreeing a wider trade deal announced in May 2025, when Britain avoided the 20 per cent tariffs Mr Trump imposed on much of the rest of the world.

William, who is president of the Football Association, could then visit during the World Cup being held in the US, Canada and Mexico between June and July. The royal family has played a key role in the United Kingdom’s ongoing relationship with Mr Trump, who has made no secret of his love of them. One of his first memories involves watching his late mother, Mary who grew up in the Hebrides, transfixed by the Queen’s coronation in 1953. During the unprecedented second state banquet for the US president, he took a chance during his speech to hail the special relationship, saying the word special did “not begin to do it justice” as he referred to the Princess of Wales as “so radiant and so healthy and so beautiful.” The second state visit invitation was interpreted by commentators as a way to appease the US leader as he returned to the White House following Joe Biden’s stint in the Oval Office and make sure that British-American relations continued to be smooth. Upon receiving the invitation from Sir Keir Starmer in February, Trump said of King Charles: “He’s a beautiful man, a wonderful man and we appreciate – I’ve known him, gotten to know him very well, actually, first term and now second term.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our drug is currently being assessed for its potential to halt the progression of a life-threatening condition. Scientists are assessing whether metformin can be repurposed to treat abdominal aortic has become the first participant in a trial designed to evaluate whether metformin can benefit individuals suffering from this condition. An AAA manifests as a balloon-like swelling within the aorta, which transports blood from the heart to the abdomen. While many aneurysms remain asymptomatic, larger formations pose a critical risk of rupture, a complication that can prove fatal. These abdominal aortic aneurysms are tragically linked to approximately 4,000 deaths annually across the UK. Philip Gosling, 80, was told that his AAA was too small for treatment. When he asked what he could do to stop it growing, he was told about the new trial, funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), which is assessing whether or not the diabetes drug metformin could halt the growth of AAAs. He was the first to join the UK arm of the trial, which is being conducted by experts from the UK, Australia and New Zealand. “I’m glad to be on the trial,” he said. “I believe in research, I see the results of it every day on the farm, where science has changed things so much from when I started. When they told me about the trial I had to get involved.” Mr Gosling was referred to a specialist after routine screening detected his AAA. Screening is offered to all men over the age of 64 because they are at highest risk of the condition. If an AAA is small, patients will not be given treatment but they will be given regular scans to check on its size. If an aneurysm grows, the risk of it bursting becomes higher. Once it grows to a certain size then a patient will be referred to a specialist to discuss treatment options. “My aneurysm is 4cm wide, so isn’t big enough to operate on. I asked what I could do to stop it growing, and that’s when they told me about the trial,” Mr Gosling said. Mr Gosling, who still helps his son on the family farm, said that the condition means he had to stop doing certain things, such as lifting heavy objects. The trial, backed by a £1.2 million BHF grant, is the largest ever drug trial for AAA and aims to recruit 1,000 patients over two years. Men and women with a small AAA who take part in the trial will be given metformin or placebo tablets daily until their AAA needs surgical repair, usually at least two years. Mr Gosling started the first stage of the trial in July, where he was given metformin in gradually larger doses over six weeks to make sure he could tolerate the drug. He is now on the second stage, where he is taking either metformin or a placebo and having regular check-ups to see if his AAA is growing. “My condition is very closely monitored, which can only be a good thing,” Mr Gosling said. “Hopefully it will help a lot of people like me in the future.” It is hoped that by slowing or preventing aneurysm growth patients could avoid major AAA surgery, which carries its own risks. Professor Matt Bown, BHF professor of vascular surgery at the University of Leicester, who is leading the UK branch of the trial, said: “Evidence suggests metformin could be the treatment for AAA we’ve long been looking for. “Research in the lab indicates it could be working to prevent AAA growth by blocking inflammation in the aorta, a key factor that causes AAA enlargement. “This trial will involve people who can currently do nothing but wait for their aneurysm to grow to a dangerous size. “We hope we will prove that daily metformin can be used to treat this group and give them some much-needed peace of mind.” Professor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the BHF, added: “Abdominal aortic aneurysm increases the risk of rupture of this major blood vessel which can have catastrophic consequences. “The risk of rupture increases as the size of the aneurysm increases and to date we don’t have effective drug treatments to limit the expansion of these aneurysms. “This is the reason the BHF is supporting this important trial to determine whether a commonly available medication, metformin, usually used for the treatment of diabetes, can limit the expansion of these aneurysms and thus, reduce the risk of rupture. “This important clinical trial will reveal whether this simple treatment can stop aneurysm growth and, if it does, this would be a major breakthrough, providing reassurance for patients affected by this condition.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our ’s leadership faces a critical test next May, with a prominent polling expert predicting significant Lord Robert Hayward has warned of heavy defeats in English council elections, a loss in the Such bleak results could reignite questions over Sir Keir’s position at the helm of the party following anonymous briefings from his allies against potential rivals that made headlines in November. Although some councils are expected to defer polls to 2027 for local government reorganisation, elections are confirmed for London and metropolitan areas including Merseyside, Greater Manchester, and Yorkshire. While these areas have recently been Labour-dominated, Lord Hayward said the party was on course for “very, very large” losses to Reform UK, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and, in east London, pro-Gaza Independent candidates. Even the Conservatives could pick up seats in London, he said, although the Tories’ overall result will depend heavily on whether elections go ahead in counties where they won heavily in 2021 but now face major losses. Gains in London councils such as Westminster or Barnet could help shore up Kemi Badenoch’s position as Conservative leader, which has come to seem more secure in recent months as her personal polling improves. Lord Hayward, a Conservative peer, said: “A few months ago it looked as if May 7 would be decisive for the leaderships of both Labour and Conservatives. “As we move into 2026 it now looks as if the May elections could decide the fate of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, but it is less clear that that will be the case for Kemi Badenoch.” He added that while Labour and possibly the Conservatives were on course to lose seats in May, there would be no clear victor, but a “cacophony of winners”. Reform, starting from a low base, is likely to make the most gains, Lord Hayward said, but a range of other parties are expected to claim some sort of victory on the night, with a clear picture perhaps only emerging in the days following the election. Despite what could be significant changes in England, Lord Hayward suggested it was the results in Scotland and Wales that could have the most long-term significance for the UK. Last year, Labour had been expecting to supplant the SNP and return to power at Holyrood in 2026. But that prospect now seems unlikely, with Lord Hayward suggesting the party was on course for “one hell of a battering” while the SNP, the Greens and Reform could do well. In Wales, the picture is more complicated given the change in the electoral system, the increase in the size of the Senedd and the lowering of the voting age to 16. Especially in light of the Caerphilly by-election in October 2025, Plaid Cymru and Reform are in line to do well at Labour’s expense. Success for the SNP and Plaid Cymru could have constitutional implications beyond the impact of the elections on Labour’s leadership. The SNP is likely to reopen calls for another independence referendum if it wins a majority in Holyrood, while major gains for Plaid Cymru could see more vocal demands for greater devolution to Wales.",The Independent,The Independent

An estimated 22.9 million people — nearly half the population — required aid in 2025, the International Committee for the Red Cross said in an article on its website Monday. But severe cuts in international aid — including the halting of U.S. aid to programs such as food distribution run by the United Nations’ World Food Program — have severed this lifeline. More than 17 million people in Afghanistan now face crisis levels of hunger in the winter, the World Food Program warned last week, 3 million more than were at risk more than a year ago. The slashing in aid has come as Afghanistan is battered by a struggling economy, recurrent droughts, two deadly earthquakes and the mass influx of Afghan refugees expelled from countries such as Iran and Pakistan. The resulting multiple shocks have severely pressured resources, including of housing and food. , the U.N. humanitarian chief, told the Security Council in mid-December that the situation was compounded by “overlapping shocks,” including the recent earthquakes and increasing restrictions on humanitarian aid access and staff. While Fletcher said nearly 22 million Afghans will need U.N. assistance in 2026, his organization will focus on 3.9 million facing the most urgent need of lifesaving help due to reduced donor contributions. Fletcher said this winter was “the first in years with almost no international food distribution.” “As a result, only about 1 million of the most vulnerable people have received food assistance during the lean season in 2025,” compared to 5.6 million last year, he said. The year has been devastating for U.N. humanitarian organizations, which have had to cut thousands of jobs and spending in the wake of aid cuts. “We are grateful to all of you who have continued to support Afghanistan. But as we look towards 2026, we risk a further contraction of life-saving help — at a time when food insecurity, health needs, strain on basic services, and protection risks are all rising,” Fletcher said. The return of millions of refugees has added pressure on an already teetering system. Minister of Refugees and Repatriation Affairs Abdul Kabir said Sunday that 7.1 million Afghan refugees had returned to the country over the last four years, according to a statement on the ministry website. Rahimullah, 29, was one of them. The former Afghan Army soldier fled to neighboring Pakistan after the Taliban seized power in 2021. He was deported back to Afghanistan two years later, and initially received aid in the form of cash as well as food. “The assistance was helping me a lot,” he said. But without it, “now I don’t have enough money to live on. God forbid, if I were to face a serious illness or any other problem, it would be very difficult for me to handle because I don’t have any extra money for expenses.” The massive influx of former refugees has also sent rents skyrocketing. Rahimullah’s landlord has nearly doubled the rent of his tiny two-room home, with walls made half of concrete and half of mud and a homemade mud stove for cooking. Instead of 4,500 afghanis (about $67), he now wants 8,000 afghanis (about $120) – a sum Rahimullah cannot afford. So he, his wife, daughter and two young sons will have to move next month. They don’t know where to. Before the Taliban takeover, Rahimullah had a decent salary and his wife worked as a teacher. But the new government’s draconian restrictions on women and girls mean women are barred from nearly all jobs, and his wife is unemployed. “Now the situation is such that even if we find money for flour, we don’t have it for oil, and even if we find it for oil, we can’t pay the rent. And then there is the extra electricity bill,” Rahimullah said. In Afghanistan’s northern province of Badakhshan, Sherin Gul is desperate. In 2023, her family of 12 got supplies of flour, oil, rice, beans, pulses, salt and biscuits. It was a lifesaver. But it only lasted six months. Now, there is nothing. Her husband is old and weak and cannot work, she said. With 10 children, seven girls and three boys between the ages of 7 and 27, the burden of providing for the family has fallen on her 23-year-old son – the only one old enough to work. But even he only finds occasional jobs. “There are 12 of us … and one person working cannot cover the expenses,” she said. “We are in great trouble.” Sometimes neighbors take pity on them and give them food. Often, they all go hungry. “There have been times when we have nothing to eat at night, and my little children have fallen asleep without food,” Gul said. “I have only given them green tea and they have fallen asleep crying.” Before the Taliban takeover, Gul worked as a cleaner, earning just about enough to feed her family. But the ban on women working has left her unemployed, and she said she developed a nervous disorder and is often sick. Compounding their misery is the harsh cold of the northern Afghan winter, when snow halts construction work where her son can sometimes find jobs. And there is the added expense of firewood and charcoal. “If this situation continues like this, we may face severe hunger,” Gul said. “And then it will be very difficult for us to survive in this cold weather.” , Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Elena Becatoros in Athens contributed to this report.",The Independent,The Independent

She wanted the comics and her dad wanted sports, but the Montana Standard meant more than their daily race to grab “Calvin and Hobbes” or baseball scores. When one of the three kids made honor roll, won a basketball game or dressed a freshly slain bison for the History Club, appearing in the Standard's pages made the achievement feel more real. Robin became an artist with a one-woman show at a downtown gallery and the front-page article went on the fridge, too. Five years later, the yellowing article is still there.

About 3,500 papers closed over the same time. An average of two a week have shut this year. That slow fade, it turns out, means more than changing news habits. It speaks directly to the newspaper's presence in our lives — not just in terms of the information printed upon it, but in its identity as a physical object with many other uses. “You can pass it on. You can keep it. And then, of course, there’s all the fun things,” says Diane DeBlois, one of the founders of the Ephemera Society of America, a group of scholars, researchers, dealers and collectors who focus on what they call “precious primary source information.” “Newspapers wrapped fish. They washed windows. They appeared in outhouses,” she says. “And — free toilet paper.” The downward lurch in the media business has changed American democracy over the last two decades — some think for better, many for worse.

In Butte, in San Antonio, Texas, in much of New Jersey and worldwide, lives without the printed paper are just a tiny bit different. For newspaper publishers, the expense of printing is just too high in an industry that's under strain in an online society. For ordinary people, the physical paper is joining the pay phone, the cassette tape, the answering machine, the bank check, the sound of the internal combustion engine and the ivory-white pair of women's gloves as objects whose disappearance marks the passage of time. “Very hard to see it while it’s happening, much easier to see things like that in even modest retrospect,” says Marilyn Nissenson, co-author of “Going Going Gone: Vanishing Americana.” “Young women were going to work and they wore them for a while and then one day they looked at them and thought, ‘This is ludicrous.’ That was a small but telling icon for a much larger social change.” Nick Mathews thinks a lot about newspapers. Both of his parents worked at the Pekin (Illinois) Daily Times. He went on to become sports editor of the Houston Chronicle and, now, an assistant professor at the University of Missouri's School of Journalism. “I have fond memories of my parents using newspapers to wrap presents,” he says. “In my family, you always knew that the gift was from my parents because of what it was wrapped in.” In Houston, he recently recalled, the Chronicle reliably sold out when the Astros, Rockets or Texas won a championship because so many people wanted the paper as a keepsake. Four years ago, Mathews interviewed 19 people in Caroline County, Virginia, about the 2018 shuttering of the Caroline , a 99-year-old weekly paper that was shuttered months before its 100th anniversary.

Yet Stastny frets about the electronic future. “We do pretty well now,” she says. “If we lost that source and had to use something else or had to purchase something, that, with the available options that we have now, would cost us more than $10,000 a year easily.” That would be nearly 1% of the budget, Stastny says, but “I’ve never been in a position to be without them, so I might be shocked with a higher dollar figure."" Until 1974, the Omaha World-Herald printed a morning edition and two afternoon ones, including a late-afternoon Wall Street Edition with closing prices. “Afternoon major-league baseball was still standard then, so I got to gorge on both baseball and stock market facts,” an 85-year-old Buffett told the World-Herald in 2013, By then, he had become the world’s most famous investor and the paper’s owner. The World-Herald ended its second afternoon edition in 2016 and Buffett left the newspaper business five years ago. Fewer than 60,000 households take the paper today, according to Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, down from nearly more than 190,000 in 2005, or about one per household. Few places symbolize the move from print to digital more than Akalla, a district of Stockholm where the ST01 data center sits at a site once occupied by the factory that prints Sweden main newspaper, Kaun says. “They have less and less machines, and instead the building is taken over more and more by this co-location data center,” she says. Data centers use huge amounts of energy, of course, and the environmental benefit of using less printing paper is also offset by the enormous popularity of online shopping. “You will see a decline in printed papers, but there is a huge increase in packaging,” says Cecilia Alcoreza, manager, of forest sector transformation for the World Wildlife Fund. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution announced in August that it would stop providing a print edition at year’s end and go completely digital, making Atlanta the largest U.S. metro area without a printed daily newspaper. The habit of following the news — of being informed about the world — can't be divorced from the existence of print, says Anne Kaun, professor of media and communication studies at Södertörn University in Stockholm. who grew up in homes with printed newspapers and magazines randomly came across news and socialized into a news-reading habit, Kaun observed. With cell phones, that doesn't happen. ""I do think it meaningfully changes how we relate to each other, how we relate to things like the news. It is reshaping attention spans and communications,” says Sarah Wasserman, a cultural critic and assistant dean at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire who specializes in changing forms of communication. “These things will always continue to exist in certain spheres and certain pockets and certain class niches,” she says. “But I do think they’re fading.""",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/amazon-fire-sticks-modified-illegal-streaming-b2872235.html,How ‘dodgy stick’ streaming became a socially acceptable crime,2025-12-27T06:00:00.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our platforms seem to launch every month (and the ones you’ve already signed up for are hiking up their prices almost as frequently), one simple device is offering access to pretty much everything you could ever want to watch. You just have to get in touch with a friend of a friend, or follow a dubious link on a pop-up-laden website, hand over a one-off fee, and you’re sorted. Or so you think. This is the promise of the so-called “dodgy stick”, the ubiquitous nickname for modified – or, to use the more technical term, “jailbroken” – versions of easy-to-use devices such as Amazon Fire Sticks that come pre-loaded with thousands of free channels and streaming libraries. Conduct a quick poll of your friends or colleagues, and you’ll probably discover that many of them already own a similar device. Perhaps they’re using it to follow their football team of choice without endless sports subscriptions, or to watch American shows before they land in the UK. Using modified sticks to stream content that you’re not paying for violates the Fraud Act of 2006. Yet this doesn’t seem to put off the devotees. Otherwise law-abiding citizens who’d never dream of dabbling in other illicit behaviour seem perfectly happy to break the rules when it comes to dodgy sticks. Some of them don’t even realise they’re doing anything wrong. found that almost five million of us consumed pirated sports coverage over the past six months, with 31 per cent admitting to using a modified Fire TV Stick or similar to do so. These that earlier this year, Sky’s chief operating officer Nick Herm claimed that their use accounted for “probably about half of the piracy” in the UK, and argued that “tech giants” such as Amazon were failing to sufficiently “address some of those problems”. He suggested it is costing the broadcasting industry hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. It’s almost as if owning a dodgy stick has become the ultimate “acceptable” crime, infiltrating middle-class homes. Eva*, 34, is a recent convert. She and her partner sourced one from a friend after they worked out the exact amount they’d been spending on streaming as part of their mortgage application process. “It was ridiculous how much we were paying each month, especially for sports,” she says. “It wasn’t worth it for a couple of games or boxing matches.” It is £80 for a year’s use of the illegal option, or spend just under that amount per month on the legitimate versions? It was an easy decision – especially when it meant they had unlimited access to new episodes of The platform she uses boasts sports, TV series and films – even ambient footage of virtual log fires, just in time for Christmas festivities. Sometimes they have to faff around with the language settings when their new favourite show suddenly defaults to a French dub, but it’s a sacrifice they’re willing to make for the savings. That they might be eating away at the potential profits of a mega media corporation “hasn’t crossed [their] minds” and the fact that “everybody is doing it” makes it feel less illicit. So how does it work? What makes a dodgy stick so, well, dodgy? When a device is “jailbroken”, its inbuilt protections have been bypassed, explains ethical hacker Rob Shapland. Once this has been done, pirates can load it up with their own apps from outside the official app stores, which allow viewers to access illegal content in a process known as “sideloading”. Sellers tend to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations. “It’s mates bragging down the pub, saying, ‘I’ve got access to this’, and it feels like there’s no downside,” Shapland says. WhatsApp groups, social media accounts and websites will pop up offering the devices, too. The illicit appeal is obvious: the pirates have taken something that the average consumer already knows how to use (like a Fire TV Stick, for example) and packed it with a whole load of shiny streaming options, at what seems like a great price. Once, anyone hoping to access an illegal stream would have had to poke around in the murky recesses of the internet to try and find one. With one of these devices, though, they can simply plug and play. It’s so straightforward that it might not necessarily feel like breaking the law. Using a modified stick “becomes an easy route into illegal streaming”, says David Ingham, head of media, entertainment and sport at tech consultancy . The average customer, he suggests, “and even some of the middlemen selling these devices, [does] not realise that they are stepping into a world of piracy, fraud and the theft of intellectual property. They think they are simply buying or passing on a low-cost gadget”. “The simple fact of the matter is that this is a fraud and everyone since time immemorial has tended to look at fraud as a victimless crime against corporations,” says Kieron Sharp, (FACT). He suggests that the popularity of modified sticks is essentially the modern equivalent of picking up pirated videos or DVDs back in the day. “People would jump at the chance of buying them very cheaply regardless of the fact that they were stolen.” The cost of living crisis has certainly squeezed the nation’s disposable income; couple this with rising streaming subscription prices, and you have a landscape where it’s easy for users to “justify the infraction as acceptable”, as Ingham puts it. This year alone, Netflix has in the UK to £12.99 a month, marking an increase of 18 per cent; Disney+ has hiked its standard rates by £1 a month, and so has Apple TV (a subscription for the latter now costs twice as much as it did when it launched in November 2019). This is a fraud and everyone since time immemorial has tended to look at fraud as a victimless crime against corporations But investing in a device that seems like a bargain might turn out to cause users a whole load of pain in the long run. As well as coming pre-loaded with streaming apps, the chances are that your dodgy stick will also be riddled with viruses and malware. A recent survey from found that 65 per cent of people who’ve watched content illegally over the past 12 months have had a security scare while doing so. “If you think about the morals of the people that are making the sticks, they’re obviously breaking the rules already,” says Shapland. “It’s not a very big step to then put software on there that allows [them] to access someone’s online banking account”. Sometimes, Shapland adds, the device might act as a keylogger, recording your passwords and personal details and then sending them on to the criminals. According to a survey from BeStreamWise, almost four in 10 illegal streamers have suffered financial losses after being targeted by fraudsters; the average amount stolen was £1,680, but one in 10 respondents ended up losing more than £5,000. Once you’ve entered your payment details, fraudsters might activate “set and forget” payments, and “just keep billing”, says Gareth Sutcliffe, the author of a recent report into video piracy from media and tech consultancy . Or they might steer users towards cryptocurrencies through dodgy sideloaded apps, or sell your details to a third party. So, when you’re handing over, say, £20 for your dodgy stick, you’re potentially inviting organised crime groups into the comfort of your own living room. “The idea, really, is [for criminals] to be able to put their tentacles right into the average consumer”, who often thinks that “they’ve got a good deal, when in fact they’ve opened the hen house door to the fox”, says Sutcliffe. And your money could end up funding other types of organised crime activity, too. But Sutcliffe reckons that the rise of the dodgy stick is not just about arbitrage, or “getting something for less than you would pay for if you were going through a legitimate service”. It’s also a question of innovation. “If the broadcasters were innovating more, providing different sets of packages, a wider range of services, would that be something that perhaps would ameliorate the risk from piracy?” he asks. “You have to argue: ‘possibly, yes.’” Sky’s chief operating officer has estimated that piracy is costing sports broadcasting companies hundreds of millions of dollars. Again, it’s easy for illegal streamers to tell themselves that football, for example, is already a wildly lucrative industry, and that broadcasters (and the players) don’t need the extra money. But Sharp tells me that “the Premier League would not be attracting the best players in the world, would not be seen as the best league in the world, would not be the most watched sporting event in the world if people weren’t paying for it in the first place”. The same goes for TV shows and films. Most of these projects cost vast amounts of money, Sharp notes, and plenty of them “don’t actually make a profit. None of those things would happen if people weren’t paying [for content]”. And when broadcasters cut back, it’s the ordinary workers who feel the impact. “There’s only a few people getting millions – the rest are all being paid normal wages as sound technicians or set designers or whatever it might be,” he says. A crackdown is underway. Over the past couple of years, a handful of sellers have been in prison on copyright and fraud charges. And in recent weeks, you might have seen headlines about a spate of raids across the UK. When law enforcement operatives raid suppliers, they can typically access their customer databases and find out who is using the devices, Sharp explains. But, he says, the emphasis is usually on the suppliers. “Our intention is never to criminalise everybody within the whole ecosystem,” he says, noting that the users are “people we would like to see as being legitimate players. They’re obviously film fans, football fans – we want to see them paying for the original content in its best format, and to save themselves any potential future heartache if they were to fall foul of the law”. Even if this particular Fire Stick diminishes in terms of its risk to the public and to content owners, others will come up in its place Amazon has also stepped up its efforts. Last month, the company which has always maintained that it “encourages the responsible consumption of content”, confirmed that it is in the process of blocking pirate apps on its Fire TV Sticks. This is currently in progress in Germany and France and is set to expand globally. “We’ll now block apps identified as providing access to pirated content, including those downloaded from outside our app store,” a spokesperson said. And the latest Fire TV Stick model, the 4K Select, uses a new operating system called Vega, which doesn’t allow sideloading, rather than the previous Android software. This won’t necessarily wipe out the pirates, who are pretty nifty when it comes to innovating and adapting. “Even if this particular Fire Stick diminishes in terms of its risk to the public and to content owners, others will come up in its place,” says Sutcliffe. “It’s always like whack-a-mole.” And if you’re still willing to break the law to get your streaming fix? Just don’t kid yourself that you’re making some big anti-establishment gesture. “It’s very easy to think of it as, ‘I’m just sticking a finger up to the man,’” Shapland says. “But you end up screwing yourself over instead.”",The Independent,The Independent

A style influencer with a social media account that was earning up to six figures per post. Ambassadorships with Versace, Gucci, and L’Oreal, to name but a few. has been made about her career and life with her famous rapper husband, whom she married in a 19th-century Sicilian palazzo, a wedding featured in -style reality TV series about their family, titled . There was even a Barbie doll named after her. And yet, in 2023, the same year that her company was valued at €75m (£65m), Ferragni’s extensive empire came crashing down – over a Christmas cake. Now, she’s facing jail time on charges of aggravated fraud. Dubbed “Pandorogate” by the Italian media, the scandal unfolded after the Italian Competition Authority accused Ferragni of falsely suggesting that proceeds from sales of a special edition Pink Christmas Pandoro cake, a traditional Italian delicacy, that she sponsored would go to a children’s hospital. The cakes were priced three times higher than normal. An investigation into the finances behind the deal found that the cake manufacturer, Balcoco, donated €50,000 to the hospital and paid Ferragni €1m for her involvement. She was charged at a criminal trial in Milan in November and, if convicted, could face up to five years behind bars. To make matters worse, Ferragni was embroiled in a similar debacle just last year after Italian antitrust authorities investigated misleading communications about a set of Easter eggs sold in connection with children’s charities with the mogul’s label. According to reports, just $41,650 of the $1.39m that Ferragni and the manufacturer earned went to charity. This has led to a statute change, which has become popularly known as The Ferragni Law and is designed to regulate influencers with more than a million followers and combat false advertising. In terms of what comes next, Ferragni has already paid more than €3m to resolve these disputes, with a €1.2m settlement to a children’s autism organisation, €1m to the Turin children’s hospital and a €1m fine to the Italian Competition Authority. In December 2023, she posted an apology video on Instagram, admitting to a “communications error” over the cakes. Ferragni launched her blog, The Blonde Salad, in 2009 when she was still a student at law school. Very quickly, she amassed a large and dedicated following, thanks to her personal, -friendly posts that were magazine-like in their style. It tapped into the cultural mood of the time, all candid personal style photos featuring bold colours, gaudy prints, and silly faces that made her content seem aspirational but also relatable. An early adopter of Instagram, she was one of the earliest social media influencers, posting tidbits from her life on her own terms. Quickly building up a significant number of followers, in 2015, she became the first blogger to land a even ran its first-ever case study on a “She was one of the first individuals to turn personal style content into a global brand, monetising her online presence while establishing partnerships with luxury labels,” says Andrew Witts, digital marketing expert at Studio 36, an SEO agency. “For many aspiring influencers, Chiara was the first person they truly recognised as having transformed influence into business success.” For many, Ferragni’s career set the precedent for what influencers could do with their platforms. “Chiara Ferragni was the influencer that made many of us stop and think,” says Victoria Morais, digital marketing expert at Eskritor. “She started her blog in 2009 and somehow managed to turn her lifestyle and personality into a brand people cared about. For a lot of us creators, she was the first one we really noticed. And she had a knack for making her commercial partnerships look seamless and not just like a paid ad slapped on her page.” Ferragni’s profile soared further when she married Fedez in a highly publicised ceremony said to be worth more than €1m that had people calling her the Italian Kim Kardashian – she wore three custom Dior gowns. The former couple have two children together, and to this day, Ferragni posts photos of them on her Instagram account, which currently has 28.1 million followers. It transpires that, even in the wake of scandal, her influence is such that she has maintained a loyal legion of fans. “Chiara is not just a creator; in Italy, she is part of the cultural fabric,” explains Lauren Beeching, a reputation manager for celebrities and crisis PR specialist. “She built a fully fledged commercial empire at a time when influencer businesses were still considered experimental, and she became a reference point for how personal branding could evolve into something corporate and globally recognised.” Hence why the scandal has sent such shockwaves across multiple industries, spanning social media, fashion, beauty and more. Ferragni was an influencer at a time when the role was still gaining legitimacy. In 2016, four editors criticised those who were suddenly arriving at Fashion Week’s front rows. “Note to bloggers who change head-to-toe paid-to-wear outfits every hour: please stop.” wrote Sally Singer, the magazine’s then-creative digital director. “Find another business. You are heralding the death of style.” In 2024, that the influencer industry was worth approximately $250bn. “Chiara was doing all this at a time when it was incredibly hard,” recalls the writer and fashion commentator Camille Charriere. “You were looked down on; it was embarrassing and sneered at as a profession.” In person, Chiara was always friendly and warm, says Charriere. “I met her a few times, and people would say the same about her as they would about Kim Kardashian; she had a very strong work ethic and a very well-crafted veneer where she was still a blank canvas that could be projected onto, which is one of the reasons why she became so successful.” Regardless of the trial’s outcome, Ferragni’s downfall is set to change the influencer industry for good, marking a tidal shift in the way brands partner with talent. “What this shows is that influence alone no longer guarantees trust,” says Morais. “Audiences and regulators expect transparency and honesty, and any charitable claims need to be clearly backed up. I see this as a milestone for the influencer industry. It signals that audiences are paying closer attention, brands are asking for more accountability, and creators need to be thoughtful and transparent in how they communicate with their followers. Those who embrace that shift and show consistency have a chance to maintain credibility. Those who don’t risk losing their social license entirely.” After a brief hiatus, Ferragni has slowly been trying to blend back into public life. She has since divorced from her husband, Federico Leonardo Lucia, known as Fedez, with both parties fighting off allegations of infidelity. There have been appearances at fashion shows, including Stella McCartney and Schiaparelli, and even a few brand deals with various luxury hotels and fashion labels. Still, the criminal trial is ongoing, and Ferragni is expected to appear in court on 19 December. The negative press surrounding the trial has already had a damning impact, with Ferragni losing followers as well as approximately €5.7m in losses across Fenice and Tbs Crew, the companies that manage her work partnerships. And while a glance at her Instagram it all seems to be business as normal: in her bio, she refers to herself as “Leone and Vittoria’s mama and entrepreneur from Italy”, with recent posts including snaps on the slopes in St Moritz, a trip to Sao Paulo and mirror selfies, Google her name and all you’ll see are negative headlines surrounding the trial, referring to her “scandal”, and speculating over jail time. The criminal trial is ongoing, and the case signals one thing for certain: better regulation within the influencer economy is needed in order to preserve authenticity, credibility, and brand legitimacy. “People feel they’ve been lied to by Chiara, but this is what social media is: the more you perform relatability, the more you can profit from it,” adds Charriere. “There needs to be an overhaul in the way influencers work with brands.” Research from Deloitte and eMarketer shows that audience trust directly correlates with engagement and revenue, with scandals sometimes leading to a 20–30 per cent drop in follower engagement. “Ferragni’s story is both a cautionary tale and a testament to social media entrepreneurship: her influence reshaped the industry, while her challenges highlight the importance of credibility, strategy, and adaptability in sustaining a personal-brand business,” says Witts. Ferragni’s saving grace could come via amplified messaging that distances her from the charity deal. “Companies like hers run with full teams of accountants, lawyers, compliance staff and managers,” says Beeching. “From my experience working with brands of similar size, I would be extremely surprised if she was personally overseeing the financial mechanics of a specific campaign. That is simply not how operations work at this level. Founders set direction rather than running the administrative processes.” Still, the buck stops with Ferragni; she is the brand, literally and metaphorically. Hence her comeback from all this will be all the more difficult. “I think recovery is possible, but it will depend on the legal outcome and on how she approaches the aftermath,” adds Beeching. “The situation is clearly off-brand for her, which makes it feel more destabilising in the short term. But off-brand moments are not always fatal.” Indeed, Martha Stewart managed to reclaim her positive public image after a prison stint related to financial issues. “People respond to how someone navigates the aftermath rather than to the headline itself,” says Beeching, who has worked with high-profile individuals in similar circumstances on rebuilding their image. “In the long term, audiences tend to be far more forgiving of financial controversies than anything involving people getting hurt,” she adds. “Chiara has a decade of familiarity behind her and a very loyal audience. With the right approach and enough time, rebuilding is entirely possible.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Grey hair is an inevitable hallmark of ageing. It’s a visual reminder of the passing years and all the bodily changes that accompany it. But emerging scientific research is challenging this simple narrative – revealing that those could be an outward sign of our body’s own intricate defences against A new study in mice has uncovered the remarkable ways in which our bodies manage cellular damage – In ageing, cellular damage gradually weakens and disrupts cell function. In cancer, unrepaired or faulty cells can trigger abnormal growth and tumour formation. The work here has highlighted a surprising connection between the loss of pigment in our hair and the mechanisms that can keep deadly cancers at bay. Melanocyte stem cells are at the heart of this discovery. These cells reside deep within the hair follicles and serve as a reservoir for melanocytes – the pigment-producing cells responsible for hair and skin colour. Under normal circumstances, our melanocyte stem cells replenish these pigment-producing cells through cyclical regeneration, a process characterised by repeated phases of activity, resting and renewal in sync with the natural cycles of hair growth and loss. This grants a steady supply of pigment and thus vibrant hair colour throughout most of our lives. But every day, our cells endure assaults on its own DNA (the genetic material inside our cells) from sources such as ultraviolet radiation, chemical exposure and even our own cellular metabolism process. This cellular damage contributes to both ageing and to the risk of cancers – such as melanoma, a type of skin cancer. This new study sheds light on what happens when melanocyte stem cells deep within the supportive niche of the hair follicle sustain DNA damage – particularly a type of damage called double-strand breaks. When this happens, the melanocyte stem cells can undergo a process called “seno-differentiation”. In essence, this means that the stem cells irreversibly mature into pigment cells – then disappear from the stem cell pool, leading to the gradual appearance of grey in our hair. This protective process is tightly regulated by internal signalling pathways which allow the cells to communicate with each other. By removing these mature cells from the stem cell population, this prevents the accumulation and possible future spread of genetic mutations or DNA changes that could promote cancer. Justin Stebbing is a Professor of Biomedical Sciences at Anglia Ruskin University. and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. Read the In a sense, each grey hair is a small victory of bodily self-sacrifice: a cell choosing to bow out rather than risk turning malignant. The story doesn’t end there, however. Not all DNA damage triggers this protective process. In their experiments, the researchers exposed melanocyte stem cells in mice to potent cancer-causing chemicals as well as UV radiation. Remarkably, under these stressors, melanocyte stem cells were found to bypass seno-differentiation altogether. Instead, signals from the surrounding tissues actually encouraged the damaged cells to self-renew and continue dividing – despite carrying genetic damage. This created a cellular environment ripe for the emergence of melanoma. This research suggests that the fate of melanocyte stem cells appears to hinge on both the specific kind of damage they receive and on the molecular cues present in their micro-environment. Stressors such as chemicals or UV light, which cause the cells’ DNA strands to break, also cause the melanocyte stem cells to self-destruct by default. This same process causes grey hair. But when under the influence of cancer cells, these damaged melanocyte stem cells persist – creating seeds from which melanoma can grow. Scientists describe this dynamic as “antagonistic fates” – where the same stem cell population can take two dramatically different paths depending on the circumstances. Importantly, these findings reframe grey hair and melanoma not as unrelated outcomes, but as twin fates of the body’s ancient struggle to balance tissue renewal and avoid cancer. Greying is not itself a shield against cancer, but instead a byproduct of a protective process that eliminates risky cells. Conversely, when the control mechanisms falter or are subverted by carcinogens, the door is left open for malignancy. This new understanding may also help begin to explain why we’re more likely to develop cancer as we get older. Of course, it’s crucial to note the limits of these findings. Much of the pivotal evidence comes from experiments in mice. This means research still needs to be conducted in humans to understand if our melanocyte stem cells also function in a similar way. Biological differences between species, as well as complexities of human lifestyles and genetics, mean the picture for our own hair and cancer risk is nuanced. Still, these discoveries open exciting avenues for both cancer research and ageing science. Understanding the signals that nudge stem cells toward differentiation or risky expansion could someday enable therapies to reinforce the body’s natural safeguards, potentially lowering cancer risk as we age. There are broader implications as well. This information could help explain why some people develop melanoma even without having been exposed to clear risk factors – and why cancers and tissue degeneration so often go hand-in-hand in later life. The story of grey hair is not just about vanity or the inevitable march of time. It’s about evolution, adaptation and the ceaseless vigilance of our bodies’ internal guardians. Those silver strands may be telling us something profound: that amid the competition between ageing and cancer, sometimes it’s worth sacrificing a pigment cell for the sake of the whole organism.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our at his residence in Florida on Sunday for crucial talks amid growing optimism in Kyiv that a peace deal may be nearing completion. The Ukrainian president announced on Friday that he would meet Mr Trump at his to discuss critical stumbling blocks, including territorial disputes and security guarantees. “This meeting is specifically for the purpose of finalising everything as much as we can,” Mr Zelensky said on Friday, adding that “a lot can be decided before the new year”. “As for the sensitive issues: we will discuss both Donbas and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We will certainly discuss other issues as well,” he told reporters in a WhatsApp chat. Mr Zelensky said that his 20-point peace plan was “90 per cent ready”, expressing hopes that it could be signed off by Mr Trump ahead of the new year. European leaders may join the talks online, he added. Moscow has spoken with Washington about the Ukrainian proposals for a peace deal, the Kremlin said, after Vladimir Putin’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev brought back copies of the proposals from Miami last week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the details of the proposals have been analysed, and that “contact took place” between Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, and US officials. Russia has made clear its intention to control the entire Donbas, comprised of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. However, throughout the latest US-led attempts to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to an agreement, Mr Zelensky has made clear that Ukraine will not cede land it currently controls. , Putin told some of Russia's top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine, but that he wants the whole of Donbas. Mr Peskov did not give much away on Friday when asked about the report, saying that he did not want to comment on the latest proposals as Russia believed making public remarks might undermine negotiations. The US has been desperately seeking a compromise and has veered between backing Kyiv and repeating Moscow’s talking points. Washington has recently proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine were to leave the Donbas area, but it is unclear how that zone would function in reality. Mr Zelensky said his meeting with Mr Trump aimed to “refine things” and discuss a possible deal on Ukraine’s economy, but that compromises on territory should be decided by the Ukrainian people in a referendum. Although he was not ready to say if a deal would be signed during the visit, Mr Zelensky said he was open to the possibility, given it is “almost ready”. He said he was planning to raise the issue of intensifying pressure on Russia during the meeting with Mr Trump. Mr Trump had previously suggested that he would meet with Mr Zelensky if he felt there was a possibility of a major diplomatic advance, after becoming increasingly frustrated by the slow pace of progress in the negotiations. But officials in Kyiv will be wary of previous failures to strike a deal in a limited timeframe. A White House meeting in which the pair were due to sign the “minerals deal” in February resulted in a showdown between Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump, who accused the Ukrainian leader of being “ungrateful” in an extraordinary televised press conference in the Oval Office. The deal was never signed. Kyiv is seeking strong security guarantees that would deter Russia from invading again, but it remains unclear what exact form these will take. As talks continued, Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in overnight drone and missile attacks, including a ramped-up assault on Ukraine’s southern region of Odesa, the main site of its sea ports.

Read our – and many fans have expressed the same complaint about its biggest character. Unexpectedly, a major driver of plot this season has been Holly Wheeler, played by the 14-year-old British-born actor Nell Fisher. Holly, the little sister of Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Nancy (Natalia Dyer), was kidnapped to the Upside Down by the demon Vecna, and in the latest batch of episodes managed to escape with help from Sadie Sink’s Max and Jake Connelly’s Derek. But some fans have complained that the increase in Holly’s screentime has impacted their affection for the show overall, particularly as it has meant reduced appearances by many long-time cast members. “I think a lot of the issues with 5 could be solved by dropping the Holly/Derek storyline and coming up with literally anything else,” wrote one person on X. “Too many characters, ages don’t make sense, using up valuable screen time.” Another person wrote: “Listen I love you #StrangerThings but I simply do not f***ing care THIS much about Holly Wheeler – particularly when some of the original main cast is getting little to zero screen time … I mean what are doing here?” Another fan asked: “Look, no offense to Holly but why is she getting more screentime than the main kids…” “Why is Holly given so much screen time?” asked one user. “Eleven is sidelined and got nothing. Not just El, but also Hopper, Joyce, and others. I would go as far to say that it’s a plot issue that does not put your old [main characters] in the centre of the plot.” Others have also theorised that Holly’s sudden significance to the show might be laying the groundwork for a spin-off series that entirely revolves around her character. “For four seasons, Holly was [in the] background by design,” reads one Reddit post. “Now, in the final season, she’s abruptly elevated with real narrative weight and noticeable screen time, with almost no buildup … Core characters who carried the show for years are having their arcs rushed or compressed, while Holly is getting focus that feels completely out of proportion to her history in the series … This doesn’t feel like a show wrapping up what it started.

Whether it was catching out a celebrity Traitor, experiencing the chaos of or getting caught in the Upside Down, the range of TV shows this year has not disappointed. Here we take a look at a few of the biggest shows. The year kicked off with the release of the second series of Apple TV’s dystopian thriller – Severance. , played by Adam Scott, and his colleagues, whose memories have been surgically divided, or severed, between their work and personal lives. Series two picked up from the dramatic end of series one, after Mark and his team’s attempted rebellion reveals that his supposedly dead wife Gemma is alive, as more secrets and conspiracies of Lumon’s true purpose bubble to the surface. , the show went on to pick up 27 Emmy nominations, taking home eight. The clinical office lights were quickly replaced with Thai sunshine as the third series of The White Lotus returned to screens. Created by Mike White, the series follows a new group of guests and staff, with some returning faces, as they arrive at the luxurious wellness resort, The White Lotus. The show examines human relationships, exploring different themes with the third series focusing on spirituality and materialism, with the peace quickly unravelling into dysfunction, chaos and death. The star-studded cast featured Sex Education star Aimee Lou Wood, Harry Potter’s Jason Isaacs, and US actors Walton Goggins and Parker Posey, with Natasha Rothwell returning to the series to play spa manager Belinda. The third series picked up six Golden Globe nominations and 23 Emmy nominations. The hit series, co-created by This Is England star , became one of the most nominated shows at this year’s Emmy Awards, with its star Owen Cooper becoming the youngest-ever male winner. The four-part British Netflix series follows 13-year-old Jamie, played by Cooper, as he is arrested on suspicion of murdering a classmate. After the arrest, Jamie’s father, Eddie Miller, played by Graham, accompanies Jamie to the police interview, where he discovers the extent of what his son is accused of doing. The programme examines so-called incel (involuntary celibate) culture, which has led to misogyny online and bullying using social media and prompted a national conversation around online safety, with Graham and co-creator Jack Thorne accepting an invitation to a parliamentary meeting on the subject by Labour MP Josh MacAlister. Directed by Boiling Point filmmaker Philip Barantini, the style of the show also made headlines with each hour-long episode filmed in one-continuous shot. The coming-of-age series caught the hearts – and minds – of many 20 to 30-year-olds this summer, who became deeply invested in the TV adaptation of the popular YA books by Jenny Han. The show, based on three books by Han – The Summer I Turned Pretty, It’s Not Summer Without You and We’ll Always Have Summer – first aired in 2022 and came to an end in September. The show is centred around Isabel “Belly” Conklin, played by Lola Tung, as she navigates growing older, from first loves to grief to going to university, all while being caught up in a love triangle with the Fisher brothers: Conrad, played by Christopher Briney, and Jeremiah, portrayed by Gavin Casalegno. Backed by a soundtrack loaded with sentimental pop hits, predominantly led by Taylor Swift, the show’s characters, storylines and nostalgia drove endless conversations and memes online and divided the internet into two camps: Team Conrad, favouring the broody older brother, and Team Jeremiah, in support of the golden retriever younger brother. Its final series, which follows Belly as she is forced to face her true feelings, drew in 25 million viewers within the first seven days of its release and became the number one show on the streaming platform in more than 120 countries.

Hosted by Claudia Winkleman, the game of deception and betrayal follows its faithful competitors as they try to find and banish the murderous traitors from within the group while completing a series of challenges to win cash for a huge prize pot for charity. Set in the Scottish highlands, the celebrity edition featured actor and broadcaster Sir Stephen Fry, Olympian Tom Daley, actress Celia Imrie, comedian , presenter Jonathan Ross, and singers Cat Burns and Paloma Faith. The dramatic finale saw traitor Carr claim the win after deceiving faithfuls, actor Nick Mohammed and historian David Olusoga, in the nail-biting final round-table. The celebrity series attracted more than six million viewers when it launched on October 8, with its final episode watched by an average of 11.1 million, with a peak of 12 million according to the BBC. Since the UK version of The Traitors launched in 2022, the show has gone on to pick up a Bafta TV Award for best reality and constructed factual programme and best entertainment performance for Winkleman. The hit supernatural coming-of-age drama returned to screens with its fifth and final series. Created by Matt and Ross Duffer, the sci-fi Netflix show began in 2016 and followed a psychokinetic girl named Eleven, played by Millie Bobby Brown, as she escaped from a laboratory in Hawkins and made friends with a group of young boys who embarked on a mission to find their friend Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) after he became lost in an alternative reality called the Upside Down. Set in the 1980s, its fourth series saw psychokinetic villain Vecna tear a rift through the town and infiltrate the mind of Max Mayfield, played by Sadie Sink, causing her to go into a coma. In the latest series, Vecna has disappeared and the US government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt to find Eleven.

The documents from the National Archives of Ireland reveal that Diana’s staff were actively engaged in ""upstaging"" St James' Palace during their highly publicised separation. These files also shed light on Charles's two-day visit to Ireland in June 1995, following his 1992 split from Diana. His inner circle reportedly viewed the extensive coverage of this trip as a crucial component of a ""long-term public relations strategy to rehabilitate the Prince in the eyes of the British public"" in the wake of their high-profile divorce. Charles’s press team, led by press secretary Alan Percival and his successor Sandy Henney, had reported to Irish officials that they felt the visit to Ireland was “the best public outing the Prince has had in a very long time”. Ms Henney was described in the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs’ document as “fiercely loyal” to Charles and “alive to every opportunity to advance his cause”. A Department of Foreign Affairs note shows officials were unsure if she was joking when she suggested that Diana may also want to visit Ireland. “Henney (who would have been less aware of the political dimension than the more restrained Percival) told me that if she had any say in it the Prince would be here again before the summer was out,” according to the document. “She also remarked that if practice to date was any guide we could shortly expect an approach from Princess Diana!” Department of Foreign Affairs official Joe Hayes added: “I took this as a joke until she repeated it and assured me that in the media battle between the two, the Princess was by far the more predatory and skilled and her staff devoted a great deal of time to finding ways and means of upstaging St James’ Palace.” Charles’ officials agreed with the Irish diplomats that coverage of the visit in the UK was, while positive, “relatively light” compared with that in Ireland.

Read our Boxing Day was a “bumper day” for all UK retail destinations as data shows shopper footfall was up 4.4% on last year, making it the strongest increase in more than a decade, industry analysts said. The retail sector may end the year on a “positive note” as December 26 saw shoppers flock to high streets, retail parks and shopping centres. With stores shut on Christmas Day, Boxing Day traditionally sees people stepping back out of their homes to bargain-hunt in the sales. While there was a slow start for high streets and shopping centres, there was a “peak” in visits to UK retail destinations from 5pm to 11pm, according to retail analysts MRI Software – which counts footfall in more than 660 retail destinations across the UK 24/7 through cameras. High streets enjoyed a 3.6% increase in footfall on last Boxing Day while retail parks saw an 8.8% uplift. Shopping centres saw footfall up 2.1% on December 26 2024. Jenni Matthews, retail analyst at MRI Software, told the Press Association: “We did see a slow start to the day for high streets and shopping centres. “Retail parks saw an uplift quite early on and that could be reflecting the sort of stores that were open on those sites – so supermarkets, some were open, some weren’t. “The fact that much of the uplift came from the evening period suggests that people may have been going out for leisure activities or going out for a bite to eat, or making the most of the events and attractions that are still taking place in some towns and cities across the UK.” were open on Boxing Day, Marks and Spencer, Aldi and Ms Matthews said the footfall increase of 4.4% on last year is “the strongest increase seen in over 10 years”.

The analyst said many people did their Christmas shopping early on in November. The boost in activity on Boxing Day was said to have been driven by a “peak in visits” to all UK retail destinations from 5pm to 11pm, averaging an increase of 9.6% on last year. This compares with an average increase of 3.1% on Boxing Day 2024 from 6am to 5pm. Coastal towns saw a 16.1% increase in footfall, which may be due to events such as markets held on high streets, according to Ms Matthews. “It’s likely to be event-driven because we know that a lot of stores were still shut yesterday,” Ms Matthews added. Ms Matthews said that, overall, December 26 “proved to be a bumper day for all UK retail destinations”. “With a number of stores still shut and not reopening until today, it’s likely that leisure and hospitality establishments may well have benefited from the annual uplift,” she added. “This is an early indicator that the retail sector may well end the year on a positive note given the challenging times faced at the beginning of the year.”",The Independent,The Independent

For her latest performance, which was pre-recorded last week so did not feature at the live event, the princess played Cooper’s piece using only her left hand, while Charlotte played with just her right in Windsor Castle’s Inner Hall. Cooper, originally from the Orkney Islands, said the music was originally written for his mother – also called Charlotte – and is about motherhood. He said: “This is the wonderful coincidence, it’s about how we see our parents in our children’s eyes and but then when you look at your mother and you look at granny, you see your children. It’s about that sort of full circle moment and it’s about motherhood.” The princess and her daughter have enjoyed playing the piece together at home, and as they performed, footage was shown of guests arriving for the carol service – with the and Kate watching as their children tied paper chains bearing their names on a “Connection Tree” outside Westminster Abbey. The princess also narrated the letter that accompanied every order of service, where she reflected on the Christmas period that reminds us “how deeply our lives are woven together”.

Read our Photis Gaitanos’ rough fingers adroitly untangle the venomous spikes of a lionfish from a net, throwing the exotic-looking creature into an ice-filled rubber bin along with other Unlike a few years ago when he would have mostly caught local staples as sea bream, red mullet or bass, the veteran fisherman now hunts for the invasive species that made its way from the Lionfish, with their red and orange-hued stripes and antennae-like barbs that menacingly ward off enemies, threaten to decimate indigenous fish stocks, wreaking havoc on the livelihoods of the roughly 150 professional The prickly fish has even made its way as far north as the Ionian Sea, where authorities have asked the public to photograph and report sightings. The East Mediterranean has also seen another invasive fish in the last decade: the silver-cheeked toadfish. Known as an eating machine whose powerful jaws cut through fishing nets, decimating fishermen’s catch, it has no natural predators off Cyprus, allowing its population to explode. That toadfish also produces a lethal toxin, making it inedible. Mr Gaitanos has fished for years in an area a few kilometres off the coastal town of Larnaca, once famous for its fishing bounty. Now, he says, it’s been more than two years since he’s caught a red mullet, a consumer favorite. “I have been practicing this profession for 40 years. Our income, especially since these two foreign species appeared, has become worse every year. It is now a major problem (affecting) the future of fishing,"" he said. ""How can it be dealt with?” Europe’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean says with the sea warming some 20 per cent faster than the global average, the presence of invasive species “is progressively increasing in the western basin”. Models show that warmer seas as a result of climate change could see lionfish swarm the entire Mediterranean by the century’s end. Warmer waters and an expanded “have opened the floodgates” to Indo-Pacific species in general, according to Cyprus’ Fisheries Department. Union’s Fisheries Commissioner Costas Kadis, a Cypriot himself, said that more frequent and intense extreme weather, often linked to climate change, could make the Mediterranean more hospitable to invasive species. And that’s taking a heavy toll on Europe’s fishing industry as fishermen’s catches diminish while their costs shoot up as a result of repairs to fishing gear damaged by the powerful intruders. “The native marine biodiversity of a specific region, as in the case of Cyprus, faces heightened competition and pressure, with implications for local ecosystems and industries dependent on them,” said Mr Kadis. Mr Gaitanos, who inherited his father’s boat in 1986, is not sure the fishermen’s grievances are being handled in a way that can stave off the profession’s decline. that there’s a big problem with the quantity of the catch as well as the kind of fish caught, affected by the arrival of these invasive species and by climate change,"" he said. Some EU-funded compensation programs have been enacted to help fishermen. The latest, enforced in 2024, pays fishermen about €4.73 (£4.13) per kilogram to catch toadfish to control their number. The toadfish are then sent to incinerators. Another project, RELIONMED, which began in 2017, recruits some 100 scuba divers to cull lionfish around wrecks, reefs and marine protected areas. The Cyprus Fisheries Department says surveys show that frequent culls could buy time for native species to recover, but it’s not a permanent fix. What local fishermen are hoping will catch on with the fish-loving public is a new campaign to serve lionfish as a delicacy after its poisonous spines are carefully removed. Mr Kadis said a social media campaign that began in 2021, #TasteTheOcean, had top European chefs and influencers plugging invasive species as a tasty alternative to the more commonly consumed fish. Renowned Cypriot chef Stavris Georgiou worked up a lionfish recipe of his own. For most Cypriots, local taverns with their rich meze menus that feature numerous plates different fish is the way to go. Although eating lionfish has been slow to catch on, many tavernas and fish restaurants have started to introduce it as part of their menu. The bonus is that lionfish is now priced competitively compared to more popular fish like sea bass. At the Larnaca harbor fish market, lionfish cost less than half as much as more popular fish like sea bass. “By incorporating invasive species such as lionfish into our diet, we can turn this challenge into an opportunity for the fisheries sector and at the same time help limit the environmental threat caused by these species,” Mr Kadis said. Stephanos Mentonis, who runs a popular fish tavern in Larnaca, has included lionfish on his meze menu as a way to introduce the fish to a wider number of patrons. Mr Mentonis, 54, says most of his customers aren’t familiar with lionfish. But its meat is fluffy and tender, and he says it can hold up against perennial tavern favorites like sea bream. “When they try it, it’s not any less tasty than any other fish,"" he said.",The Independent,The Independent

Ms Dickson, who leads the body representing the UK and Ireland’s 220,000 doctors, including GPs, surgeons and anaesthetists, : “My feeling is we are creating a culture where the rhetoric is ‘foreigner bad’. “If you have never visited Britain and are looking at our media, the social media, press media, print media, what our politicians are reported as saying, I think that it’s not unreasonable to see that as a hostile environment.” She warned that the NHS “could quite easily fall over” and be left without “a critical mass of people there to run the service safely”. “Because [foreign health staff] see Britain retreating from Europe, ‘we can go it alone’,” she continued. “They see attacks on synagogues, they see anti-Muslim protests. They see the rhetoric that immigration is bad, [that] immigration is a major problem for the country.” She asked: “Why would you go somewhere where people are going, ‘We don’t need you, we don’t want you’? For them that makes Britain appear unwelcoming, racist. The prevalence of it [hostility to migrants] is significantly more [than] ten years ago.” A 2025 workforce report by the UK’s General Medical Council found that 42 per cent of UK doctors qualified abroad.

I’m really shocked at the way this is now impacting on NHS staff.” A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The NHS benefits hugely from its international staff, and we’ll continue to support and attract talented overseas staff who want to dedicate their time, energy and skills to the health service.

But the Reform UK leader later clarified that this was only for “working British people, meaning a couple who both work 37.5 hours a week”. New Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) analysis shows that of the 470,000 households affected by the two-child limit (in receipt of Universal Credit with three or more children, of whom the third was born after 6 April 2017), just 3,700 – less than 0.8 per cent of the total – have two adults working full-time. This means that the cap would be reintroduced to apply for the vast majority of them. Charities have warned that it means there is little difference between Reform's policy and Tory plans to bring back the two child benefit cap in full with Kemi Badenoch claiming the £3.5bn to scrap it was “unaffordable” and that the Budget was “for benefits street”. With Labour and Reform battling over votes from working class communities, Anna Turley MP, chair of the Labour Party, warned: “Nigel Farage may boast about being on the side of low-paid workers, but his bogus two-child limit policy hardly helps any of the people he pretends to care about, and would lift almost no children out of poverty at all. “And the Tories put 900,000 children into poverty during their time in office and are openly committed to increasing child poverty all over again.” But a Reform UK spokesman hit back, saying: “Labour's Budget robbed alarm clock Britain in order to pay for Benefits Britain. Their blanket lifting of the two-child cap proves this government lacks the guts to tackle the runaway welfare bill and back working British families, opting instead to reward those on benefits. ""Reform will reinstate the two-child cap except for British families where both parents are in full-time work, saving the hardworking British taxpayer £2.7 billion a year over the next 5 years and incentivising more people into work."" However, charities warned about the impact of Reform’s policy on child poverty in the UK. Joseph Rowntree Foundation's chief analyst Peter Matejic said: “Removing the two-child limit in full is the best decision as far as poverty is concerned and is a necessary part of any credible child poverty strategy. “Removing it is the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty, it will reduce demand on public services over the medium-term, and increase the health and education outcomes of the children who would have been hit by the limit by the end of the decade. “Both the Reform and Conservative Party plans amount to leaving around half a million children in poverty.” Dan Paskins, executive director of UK Impact, said: ""We have been clear for many years that scrapping the two-child limit to benefits in full is the most cost effective way of bringing a significant numbers of children out of poverty. We were delighted to see the UK Government announce the end of the cap at the Budget and by their own assessment this lifts 450,000 children out of poverty. Only by scrapping the policy in full are we closer to helping children have the start in life they deserve."" Meagan Levin, Policy Manager at Turn2us, added: “Reinstating the two-child limit would push families into significant hardship. The Child Poverty Strategy was clear that this is the single most effective policy to reduce child poverty. “The proposals laid out by these [Reform and the Conservatives] to reintroduce the limit, or keep it in any conditional form, would be a major step backwards, pushing hundreds of thousands of children back into significant hardship.

Built during the height of the Cold War, when was common knowledge to residents, many of whom worked at the Greenbrier in other capacities, despite being a tightly kept government secret. Its existence was officially revealed to the world in 1992 in an exposé written by journalist Ted Gup and published in the ending more than five decades of mystery and speculation. Today, the dystopian facility has been the subject of multiple books and documentaries, and is even open to the public for tours. The Greenbrier, located around five hours' drive south-west of Washington D.C., was used by the federal government during the later years of the Second World War as an internment facility for Japanese, Italian and German diplomats. In 1942, the entire resort was purchased by the U.S. Army, and it was converted into a 2,200-bed military hospital. In 1949, ten years before ground was broken on the bunker, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson met at the Greenbrier with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretaries of the Army, Air Force and Navy for what a history of the resort called a ""top-secret discussion of postwar military strategy,” according to Gup’s article. Construction on the bunker – code-named Project Greek Island – began in 1959, a year after being authorized by Congress, when fear of a Soviet nuclear attack was at the forefront of the minds of both politicians and ordinary citizens. Two-and-a-half years and around 50,000 tonnes of concrete later, the project was completed – as John F Kennedy Jr and Nikita Khrushchev squared off over the Cuban Missile Crisis and the country scrambled to build its own backyard bomb shelters. According to Gup, the bunker was “custom-designed to meet the needs of a Congress-in-hiding, complete with a chamber for the Senate, a chamber for the House and a massive hall for joint sessions.” Two separate auditoriums, fitted with green corduroy-covered chairs and a red carpet leading to the stage, were designed to hold congressional sessions. The larger of the two has a capacity of around 470, enough to accommodate the 435-member House of Representatives. The smaller auditorium holds around 130, enough to serve as a temporary Senate chamber. A separate Exhibit Hall was meant for use in joint sessions of Congress. Elsewhere, a television studio stands, which legislators would have used to address what remained of the country, should nuclear warheads have touched down on U.S. soil. There is also a radio and communications room as well as specially soundproofed phone booths, fitted with cryptographic machines. As well as working facilities, lawmakers who would have been rushed to the bunker needed somewhere to stay – potentially for the long haul. The subterranean hideout boasts more than 1,000 bunk beds, a 400-seat cafeteria, a full kitchen, and numerous offices. Workers reported seeing over 100 urinals being transported into the construction site, which also held showers, storage rooms and enormous water tanks. There was also a huge trash incinerator that could serve, morbidly, as a crematorium. “Once the blast doors were sealed, no one could enter or leave until the crisis had passed,” Gup noted. Standing in the way of congressional members and nuclear evaporation are four enormous doors, each weighing between 18 and 30 tonnes. The blast doors were built by Mosler Safe Co., an Ohio-based manufacturer renowned for its vaults and safes, which was contracted by the government during the period to build multiple relocation centers and bunkers. Two of the four doors – known as “GH 1” and “GH 3” – were big enough to drive vehicles through, according to Gup’s report. GH 1 measured 12 feet 3 inches wide and 15 feet high and weighed more than 28 tons. GH 3, which weighed more than 20 tons. Both doors were 19.5 inches thick and hung with two hinges that weighed 1.5 tons by themselves, according to Mosler order reports. The two other doors were much smaller, with one, a hatch-like door, measuring 3 feet by 3.5 feet, and a ""personnel door"" which was 7 feet wide by 8 feet high. Mosler claimed its doors could survive the impact of an atomic bomb blast, having conducted successful tests on a vault door at the government's Nevada Test Site in 1957. The doors were moved from Mosler’s plant in Hamilton, Ohio, to West Virginia by train, though they were so big that they could not be laid in an ordinary freight car. They had to be transported either standing, tilted at an angle or in a special car that was low enough for them not to collide with tunnels or other obstacles along the way. “The Greenbrier was different in that it relied more on the element of secrecy than on any mountain of rock to shield it from incoming bombs,” Gup wrote in his article, which was published in “Yet despite the discretion of the resort staff, the existence of some kind of hidden government installation there was widely known.” It was perhaps for this reason that the piece angered not just government officials, but the locals themselves, who considered it a “point of pride” to have a secret that the rest of the country did not know about, according to lifelong Greenbrier resident Trish Parker. “When someone who they considered an outsider came in and revealed it, they felt very betrayed,” Parker told Even though they knew of the bunker’s existence, many were still surprised to learn of its real purpose and that it was large enough to hold 1,100 of the country’s most important and high-profile people. Gup’s exposé also revealed that of all the employees at Greenbrier, it was the seven-man strong team at “Forsythe Associates” – ostensibly in charge of repairing the resort’s electrical equipment – that oversaw the upkeep of the vault. In a statement released at the time, Congressional leaders expressed “regret” at “It was always clear that if the secret of the facility’s location were to be compromised, the effectiveness and security of the program would be jeopardized, if not terminated,” the statement read. The Greenbrier bunker was declassified shortly after its existence was made public, and the vault has featured in a number of articles and documentaries. Tours have run since 1995, both regular and private. Nowadays, regular admission prices for adults are $52 per person, while youth admission (from ages 10 to 17) is $24. For private tours, which can accommodate up to 25 guests, prices vary depending on time. Before 5:00 p.m.. a large private tour costs $1,205.20, increasing to $1,766 before 6.30 p.m. and going up to $1,815 before 8 p.m. Bunker tours depart from the Trellis Lobby near the lobby bar, with guests advised to allow ample time for parking, arrive 15 minutes before their allotted time, and wear comfortable shoes. The bunker will be closed to the public from March 9 to 12, 2026, according to the official website.",The Independent,The Independent

She also picked up a celebrity friend along the way,2025-12-27T12:26:49.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our mma Fogarty’s body is at least 80 percent covered in wounds at all times - but the 41-year-old gives no indication of the relentless pain, likened to the searing agony of third-degree burns, as she laughs in the car with her mother and friend on their way home from a Christmastime lunch. She was looking forward to Christmas Day, when she stays home every year with her parents and sister to watch Home Alone and enjoy a Bailey’s latte; it’s the one day of the year she takes off from agonizing bandage changes and the near head-to-toe wrapping regularly protecting her. That’s Emma’s reality of living with the most severe form of , a rare condition in which skin tears away like paper - or a butterfly’s wing. EB is so uncommon that only one out of every 50,000 people will be affected worldwide. “butterfly children” – and Emma joined their ranks when she was born in 1984, when doctors told her parents that she wouldn’t survive a week. Now, more than four decades later, Emma is one of the oldest living people in the world with EB. She’s confined to a wheelchair, almost entirely covered in bandages, her fingers fused together and her left leg amputated. She has despite “trapped in a body that has been punishing to inhabit,” according to the author of the foreword of her new memoir, Being Emma. The foreword author, a man she nonchalantly texts and banters with on a regular basis, is . He sat down next to Emma at a charity event in 2010, greeted her with his trademark Dublin “Howyah” and followed that with: “I’m starving, are you?’ Then he stared down a waiter to help Emma secure plain mashed potatoes for her meal; she’d been served a portion with raw onions, and EB scarring constricts her throat so much that she can barely force down anything–let alone raw vegetables. For years, she underwent regular throat surgeries to stretch the scar tissue and help her swallow. Colin’s glance at the server that night “hit home,” Emma writes in her memoir, published in the U.S. this month. “I think the waiter would have picked the onions out by hand after he saw it.” The evening planted the seed of a friendship that would grow incredibly close between two people just eight years apart. “We sat down beside each other, and we just felt like we’d known each other 100 years,” Emma, who lives in Co. Laois, Ireland, tells . “And then it just progressed on and on.” As Emma overcame battle after battle – from cancer diagnoses to sepsis and pneumonia – Colin supported her from 3,000 miles away … and joined her for tea at home with her family on his visits back to Ireland. “From the start, I always just wrote to him like I would any friend, filling him in on my life and asking questions about his,” Emma writes in the new memoir. “He began to respond to me in the same way. We still write to one another a lot, and talk, like friends do, about deep and personal things …He can trust me - that’s the truth - and I can trust him. That is sacred to me.” The bond led to Colin’s suggestion that he run the Dublin Marathon to raise awareness and funds for Debra Ireland, the EB charity where he’s a patron and Emma’s a spokeswoman. That, in turn, evolved into the movie star pushing Emma down the bumpy last 4km-stretch of the 2024 race, one kilometer to celebrate each of the four decades she’s survived with EB. Pictures of the touching sight — Emma bandaged in a wheelchair, Farrell’s face set with determination as he pushed her against a backdrop of marathon runners – went global. A book deal quickly followed. Emma, encouraged by her loved ones and Farrell, jumped at the chance to tell her story and educate the world about a rare condition that is devastating. EB leaves sufferers open to infection and sepsis, also affecting a huge swathe with osteoporosis. A fault in the genes means that proteins needed to hold the skin together – and tiny everyday activity like rubbing against sheets or simply wearing shoes can cause torturous wounds. Emma’s EB has been worsening progressively since birth. She defied odds, finishing college, living independently and working at a bank in Dublin – until normal activity broke a bone in her foot, leading to a decline that left her wheelchair bound. A cancer diagnosis would ultimately require the amputation of the leg in 2019; EB sufferers are particularly susceptible to cancer; as Emma explains in the book, “our skin is wounded so often and heals so poorly, it becomes fertile ground for mutations.” It was Farrell who pulled her out of the dark depression the amputation left her in, Emma tells “He just wasn’t afraid to ask the hard questions,” Emma says. “He wasn’t afraid to say, ‘How’s your head, how’s your mental health, how are you feeling?’ … I think that’s when I knew, yeah, I have a friend for life here.” She talks about the actor as “just a normal, down-to-earth guy that you could live next door to and go, ‘Well, what’s the story?’ And he’d go, ‘Grand, do you want a cup of tea?’” Emma also alludes to the fact that the actor’s son, born in 2003, suffers from , too: Angelman’s syndrome, causing developmental delays and seizures. “I think him having a son with a disability, he kind of gravitated to my family, as well, and we all just really get on now. We’re all really close, and he comes down [to our home] and he has the sandwiches with Mam.” Emma built upon the publicity from the marathon - where the jostling left her back, thighs and backside raw; the denim jeans she was wearing scuffed against her knees as well as her thighs. “I did, sadly, get injured, not on Colin’s part in any way, but … due to EB,” she tells But she bore the pain, still savoring the experience - as she and raised nearly €1million euro through the marathon participation. And then she agreed to write the book - tracing a lifetime of pain and triumph as part of what she hopes will be her legacy. “It’s just something I want to leave behind that’s a bit hopeful,” she says. She writes not just of the everyday pain and challenges but of how close-knit sufferers can be - and how their deaths hit the others devastatingly hard. She writes about surviving cruel school bullies who targeted her for the condition already causing daily agony. She writes about how tights could become stuck to her skin as a child, “sealed on and stuck into the raw wounds.” “My biggest problem is pain,” she states. “I suffer with it 90 if not 99 percent of the day, and the only time I don’t suffer with it is probably when I’m asleep.” She’s pushing for better funding, better research, better awareness and better support from health systems for EB patients. She already lost her best friend to the condition, a man three years her senior she’d known all her life who succumbed to EB-related cancer at 28. Another child sufferer she knew well, Liam, was also taken far too young from this world. , she’s seen improvements in awareness about EB and some evolution of treatments - but there is no cure and supports are still sorely lacking. “We still need to keep going,” she tells The Independent. “We still need to keep fighting.” To that end, she has Farrell plugging her book; he released a new video urging fans to buy copies for their loved ones as Christmas gifts. The pair of them “have something big happening in February,” too, she tells She believes her mission to educate the world about EB, along with her family and Farrell’s friendship, has helped her reach milestone ages that so many other patients have not. And she wants fellow sufferers, along with readers dealing with any type of obstacles in their lives, to learn her story and have hope. “My parents were told that I wouldn’t last a week and I’d be better off if I didn’t … I’m 41 now,” she says. “I shouldn’t be alive at all, in any way. “For EB families or others, I want [them] to take away that if they’re determined enough, if you’ve enough strength in your bones and your body, if you have enough fire in your belly … you can do anything in the world,” she says. “I mean it. It doesn’t have to be the biggest thing in the world, but just do something that you want to do.” Emma’s greatest defiance, writes Farrell for the book, “is her insistence on living a full and meaningful life. A life of adventure and joy. A life that is, of course, limited in many ways by Epidermolysis Bullosa, but a life that has shared so much laughter, so much friendship, had so many challenges chosen and imposed, and has triumphed over them all.” He concludes: “She’s one of the greatest teachers we have, and if the reader can feel even an ounce of the wonder, the sorrow, the strength and hope that I have felt in knowing her, then they will walk away with a life enriched for the time spent in the company of this amazing woman.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Imagine two people in their 70s. Both are active, live independently and enjoy life. But over the next 15 years, one of them develops two or three chronic illnesses – – while the other remains relatively healthy. What made the difference? may be a key part of the answer. In our new study, our group at the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institutet, , followed more than 2,400 older Swedish adults for 15 years. We found that people who consistently ate a healthy developed chronic diseases more slowly, in contrast to those whose diets were considered more inflammatory; that is, diets high in processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks, which are known to promote low-grade chronic This is important because having several health conditions at the same time is one of the biggest problems older people face. It increases the risk of disability, hospitalisation and early death. It also places a huge burden on healthcare systems. But while it has been long known that diet can help prevent individual diseases, our study shows that it may also influence the overall pace of biological We looked at four well-known dietary patterns. Three of them – the Mind diet (designed to protect brain health), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (based on foods linked to lower disease risk) and the Mediterranean diet – were associated with slower disease accumulation. The fourth, a diet high in inflammatory foods, was linked to faster accumulation. The strongest associations were seen for cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. So, people who ate better were less likely to develop diseases including heart failure, stroke, . We did not, however, find a clear link between diet and musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis or osteoporosis. Some of the benefits of healthy eating were more pronounced in women and in the oldest participants: those aged 78 and above. This suggests that it is never too late to make changes. Even in very old age, diet matters. Why does food have such a strong potential? One reason may be . As people age, many develop low-grade chronic inflammation – sometimes called “inflammaging” – which is linked to a wide range of diseases. Diets high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats tend to reduce inflammation. Diets rich in highly processed foods and sugar do the opposite. Adrián Carballo Casla is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Geriatric Epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet. Amaia Calderón-Larrañaga is an Associate Professor at the Aging Research Center at Karolinska Institutet. David Abbad Gomez is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation at Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona. Another reason is that healthy diets support the body’s resilience. They provide essential nutrients that help maintain immune function, muscle mass and cognitive health. Over time, this can make a big difference in how people age. Our study is one of the longest and most comprehensive of its kind. We used repeated dietary assessments and tracked more than 60 chronic health conditions. We also tested our findings using different analytical methods to make sure they held up. Of course, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. Physical activity, social connections and access to healthcare all play important roles in healthy . But improving diet quality is a relatively simple and accessible way to help older adults live longer, healthier lives. So what should older adults eat? The message is clear: eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Choose healthy fats like rapeseed oil and fish. Limit red and processed meats, sugary drinks and solid fats. These are the building blocks of the diets we studied – and they have been associated with slower ageing, better brain health and fewer chronic diseases in this and other research. Ageing is inevitable. But people can shape how it unfolds. Our findings suggest that even small changes in diet can make a meaningful difference in how people experience later life, regardless of their age.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Whether you had breakfast this morning or not, your is working quietly behind the scenes. This vital organ produces the enzymes that help digest your food and the hormones that regulate your metabolism. But when something goes wrong with your has earned the grim nickname “the silent killer” for good reason. By the time most patients experience symptoms, the disease has often progressed to an advanced stage where treatment options become severely limited. alone, over 10,700 new cases and 9,500 deaths from were recorded between 2017 and 2019, with incidence rates continuing to rise. The most common form, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), develops in the pancreatic duct – a tube connecting the pancreas to the small intestine. When tumours form here, they can block the flow of digestive enzymes, causing energy metabolism problems that leave patients feeling chronically tired and unwell. Yet these symptoms are often so subtle that they’re easily dismissed or attributed to other causes. Now, researchers are turning to an unexpected source for early PDAC detection: faecal samples. While analysing poo might seem an unlikely approach to cancer diagnosis, scientists are discovering that our waste contains a treasure trove of information about our health. This is because your gut is home to trillions of bacteria – in fact, bacterial cells in your body outnumber human cells by roughly 40 trillion to 30 trillion. These microscopic residents form complex communities that can reflect the state of your health, including the presence of disease. Since PDAC typically develops in the part of the pancreas that connects to the gut, and most people have regular bowel movements, stool samples provide a practical, non-invasive window into what is happening inside the body. This innovative approach has been validated in studies across several countries, including Japan, China and Spain. The latest breakthrough comes from a 2025 international study involving researchers in Finland and Iran, which set out to examine the relationship between Falk Hildebrand is a Researcher in Bioinformatician at the Quadram Institute. Daisuke Suzuki is a PhD Candidate in Gut Microbiome at the Quadram Institute. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence. Read the The researchers collected stool samples and analysed bacterial using a technique called 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Despite the complex name, the principle is straightforward: scientists sequence and compare a genetic region found in every bacterium’s genome, allowing them to both identify and count different bacterial species simultaneously. The findings from the Finnish-Iranian study were striking. Patients with PDAC exhibited reduced bacterial diversity in their gut, with certain species either enriched or depleted compared with healthy people. More importantly, the team developed an artificial intelligence model that could accurately distinguish between cancer patients and healthy people based solely on their gut bacterial profiles. The field of microbiome research is evolving rapidly. While this study used amplicon sequencing, newer methods like “shotgun metagenomic sequencing” are providing even more detailed insights. This advanced technique captures the entire bacterial genome content rather than focusing on a single gene, offering an unprecedented resolution that can even detect whether bacteria have recently transferred between individuals. These technological advances are driving a fundamental shift in how we think about health and disease. We’re moving from a purely human-centred view to understanding ourselves as “human plus microbiome” – complex ecosystems where our bacterial partners play crucial roles in our wellbeing. The possibilities go well beyond pancreatic cancer. At Quadram, we’re applying similar methods to study colorectal cancer. We’ve already analysed over a thousand stool samples using advanced computational tools that piece together bacterial genomes and their functions from fragmented DNA. This ongoing work aims to reveal how gut microbes behave in colorectal cancer, much like other scientists have done for PDAC. The bidirectional interactions between cancer and bacteria are particularly fascinating – not only can certain bacterial profiles indicate disease presence, but the disease itself can alter the , as we previously showed in Parkinson’s disease, creating a complex web of cause and effect that researchers are still unravelling. Nonetheless, by understanding how our microbial partners respond to and influence disease, we’re gaining insights that could revolutionise both diagnosis and treatment. Our past research has shown this to be incredibly complex and sometimes difficult to understand, but developments in biotechnology and artificial intelligence are increasingly helping us to make sense of this microscopic world. For cancer patients and their families, this and other advancements in microbiome research offer hope for earlier detection. While we’re still in the early stages of translating these findings into clinical practice, the potential to catch this silent killer before it becomes deadly could transform outcomes for thousands of patients, but it will require more careful and fundamental research. The microbial perspective on health is no longer a distant scientific curiosity – it’s rapidly becoming a practical reality that could save lives. As researchers continue to explore this inner frontier, we’re learning that the answer to some of our most challenging medical questions might be hiding in plain sight – in the waste we flush away each day.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Whether it’s stand-up comedy specials or a dramedy series, when American Mo Amer sets out to create, he writes what he knows. descent has received critical acclaim for it, too. The second season of Amer's “Mo” documents Mo Najjar and his family’s tumultuous journey reaching asylum in the Amer's show is part of an ongoing wave of television from Arab American and Muslim American creators who are telling nuanced, complicated stories about identity without falling into stereotypes that Western media has historically portrayed. “Whenever you want to make a grounded show that feels very real and authentic to the story and their cultural background, you write to that,” Amer told The Associated Press. “And once you do that, it just feels very natural, and when you accomplish that, other people can see themselves very easily.” At the start of its second season, viewers find Najjar running a falafel taco stand in Mexico after he was locked in a van transporting stolen olive trees across the U.S.-Mexico border. Najjar was trying to retrieve the olive trees and return them to the farm where he, his mother and brother are attempting to build an olive oil business. Both seasons of “Mo” were smash hits on Netflix. The first season was awarded a Peabody. His third comedy special on Netflix, “Mo Amer: Wild World,” premiered in October. Narratively, the second season ends before the Hamas attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but the series itself doesn't shy away from addressing Israeli-Palestinian relations, the ongoing conflict in Gaza or what it's like for asylum seekers detained in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. In addition to “Mo,” shows like “Muslim Matchmaker,” hosted by matchmakers Hoda Abrahim and Yasmin Elhady, connect Muslim Americans from around the country with the goal of finding a spouse. The animated series, “#1 Happy Family USA,” created by , who worked with Amer to create “Mo,” and Pam Brady, follows an Egyptian American Muslim family navigating life in New Jersey after the 9/11 terrorists attack in New York. The key to understanding the ways in which Arab or Muslim Americans have been represented on screen is to be aware of the “historical, political, cultural and social contexts” in which the content was created, said Sahar Mohamed Khamis, a University of Maryland professor who studies Arab and Muslim representation in media. After the 9/11 attacks, Arabs and Muslims became the villains in many American films and TV shows. The ethnic background of Arabs and the religion of Islam were portrayed as synonymous, too, Khamis said. The villain, Khamis said, is often a man with brown skin with an Arab-sounding name. A show like “Muslim Matchmaker” flips this narrative on its head, Elhady said, by showing the ethnic diversity of Muslim Americans. “It’s really important to have shows that show us as everyday Americans,"" said Elhady, who is Egyptian and Libyan American, ""but also as people that live in different places and have kind of sometimes dual realities and a foot in the East and a foot in the West and the reality of really negotiating that context."" Before 9/11, people living in the Middle East were often portrayed to Western audiences as exotic beings, living in tents in the desert and riding camels. Women often had little to no agency in these media depictions and were “confined to the harem” — a secluded location for women in a traditional Muslim home. This idea, Khamis said, harkens back to the term “orientalism,” which Palestinian American academic, political activist and literary critic Edward Said coined in his 1978 book of the same name. Khamis said, pointing to countries like Britain and France, the portrayal in media of people from the region was ""created and manufactured, not by the people themselves, but through the gaze of an outsider. The outsiders in this case, he said, were the colonial/imperialist powers that were actually controlling these lands for long periods of time.” Among those who study the ways Arabs have been depicted on Western television, a common critique is that the characters are “bombers, billionaires or belly dancers,” she said. Sanaz Alesafar, executive director of Storyline Partners and an Iranian American, said she has seen some “wins” with regard to Arab representation in Hollywood, noting the success of “Mo,” “Muslim Matchmaker” and “#1 Happy Family USA.” Storyline Partners helps writers, showrunners, executives and creators check the historical and cultural backgrounds of their characters and narratives to assure they’re represented fairly and that one creator’s ideas don't infringe upon another's. Alesafar argues there is still a need for diverse stories told about people living in the Middle East and the English-speaking diaspora, written and produced by people from those backgrounds. “In the popular imagination and popular culture, we’re still siloed in really harmful ways,” she said. “Yes, we’re having these wins and these are incredible, but that decision-making and centers of power still are relegating us to these tropes and these stereotypes.” Deana Nassar, an Egyptian American who is head of creative talent at film production company Alamiya Filmed Entertainment, said it's important for her children to see themselves reflected on screen “for their own self image.” Nassar said she would like to see a diverse group of people in decision-making roles in Hollywood. Without that, it's “a clear indication that representation is just not going to get us all the way there,” she said. Representation can impact audiences’ opinions on public policy, too, according to a recent study by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Results showed that the participants who witnessed positive representation of Muslims were less likely to support anti-democratic and anti-Muslim policies compared to those who viewed negative representations. For Amer, limitations to representation come from the decision-makers who greenlight projects, not from creators. He said the success of shows like his and others are a “start,” but he wants to see more industry recognition for his work and the work of others like him. “That's the thing, like just keep writing, that's all it's about,"" he said. ""Just keep creating and keep making and thankfully I have a really deep well for that, so I’m very excited about the next things,” he said.

It saw Nancy Wheeler and Jonathan Byers, played by real-life couple Natalia Dyer and Charlie Heaton, break up after a candid conversation while their fates hang in the balance. At the end of the scene, Jonathan reveals he’s been carrying around an engagement ring and, after the pair confess to everything they find annoying about each other, he says: “I figure that I have screwed up enough with you that it'd be nice to get something right for once, in the end. Nancy Wheeler, will you not marry me?' Nancy accepts, tells him she loves him and kisses him – just before they discover an escape. Fans were left confused by the resolution of the scene, and series creators the Duffer brothers have since confirmed this was supposed to indicate the end of their relationship. “It's hard to recall when exactly that idea came, but I think us – and the writers – all felt that Nancy needed to end up on her own and be independent and have an opportunity to find herself,” they added. Fans are complaining that the scene needed to be clearer, arguing that it wasn’t obvious that the scene was meant to be a breakup. ”This did not feel like a breakup scene,” one person wrote on X/Twitter, with another adding: “I didn't even realise this was what they were aiming for.” An additional fan wrote: ”absolutely everyone that watched this scene had no idea this was even what happened…” series started in 2016, none of the main ensemble have left the show, with all of the cast members making it to New subscribers only. £9.99/mo. after free trial.

A man in his 40s, who is thought to have tried to help Mr Upham, also remains unaccounted for after swimmers entered the water just before 10.25am on Thursday. Several people had to be pulled to safety after strong winds created huge swells, which dragged people underwater. Friends, who said Mr Upham had tried to get out of the water but was washed back down the beach by a huge wave, were yesterday still clinging on to hope he could be sheltering somewhere on the coast. Describing him as “exceptionally kind” and well-liked in the seaside town, they told the : “He goes swimming practically every day, he's very fit and knows the waters locally well. “Lots of people went yesterday because of the Christmas Day swim, but Matthew would have been there regardless. “He'd never intend to spark such a big rescue effort, in fact he'd be horrified at putting anyone at risk to look for him.” Another added: “It looks as though Matthew was trying to come out of the water, but was pulled back out and drifted further down the beach. “We don't know who the man in his 40s is. We believe he is someone who'd gone to try and help Matthew.” Mike Brown, 60, who does the Christmas Day swim most years, said that he was “unable to get out” after entering the sea but was helped by “two very brave men” who waded into the water and pulled him to safety. ""It was much worse conditions than normal and some of the worst conditions I've ever tried to swim in,” he told the BBC. “With hindsight it was clearly a mistake to try and get in."" He added: ""They took an arm each and dragged me to safety and as quickly as it had started, it was over, I was on the beach and I was safe."" A number of people were brought to shore and checked either by paramedics at the scene or taken to hospital as a precaution, police said. Although the swim is an annual tradition which is replicated by wild swimmers at beaches across the country over Christmas, it is an unofficial event and is not supported by lifeguards. A passing RNLI lifeboat, which was out on a training exercise, was able to quickly respond after swimmers got into trouble, according to reports. HM Coastguard joined a major multi-agency search and rescue operation as they repeatedly scoured the coastline in the face of large waves and strong winds. Search efforts were halted at 5pm on Christmas Day after “extensive shoreline and offshore searches”. In a statement, they paid tribute to RNLI volunteers “who put to sea without hesitation in an atrocious sea state”. In a post on Facebook, RNLI Exmouth said conditions “were extremely difficult and cold for the crew involved in the search who were out all day”, adding that many organised swims have been cancelled as a result.

But it appears their prayers are now being answered. Styles broke his silence Saturday by dropping a surprise video, titled “Forever, Forever,” on his YouTube channel. The eight-minute-long clip began with fans preparing for his last performance during his “Love on Tour,” which took place in Reggio Emilia, Italy, in July 2023.

Read our , it was because she had long dreamed of working with women to improve their healthcare and rights. But she, like countless others in the profession, now fears that the “dangerously long shifts” she is sometimes forced to work are putting the safety of her and her patients at risk. , she will sometimes work a full day shift before being put on call through the night. This means she could be asked to work for over 24 hours, delivering vital care to mothers and babies. “It’s not safe, and no other profession is expected to stay awake, give care and concentrate for that long,” the midwife of 19 years told . “So why is it that midwives, who have such a high level of responsibility, are expected to do that? “Working these sorts of hours is not safe for midwives or for mothers.” She is one of the more than 14,000 people who have signed a petition calling for legal restrictions on midwives’ working hours to be implemented. Midwife and author Leah Hazard started the petition after reading about Jennifer Cahill, 34, who died shortly after giving birth to her second child, Agnes Lily Wren Cahill, at home. The coroner’s report found “gross failure” in her care led to her death, and also that the two midwives at her delivery had been awake for over 30 hours. “I know what it’s like as a midwife for you to do a night shift and to be sleep deprived, but then to have been awake or even working the whole day before that, I thought, ‘Oh, this is really unconscionable’,” Ms Hazard said. “Of course, that will affect people’s competence because it’s well evidenced that sleep deprivation can cause cognitive impairment similar to alcohol consumption. You don’t want anybody looking after you who’s operating with that level of impairment.” After sharing the story on social media, she received an “overwhelming” response from more than 100 midwives sharing their own experiences of “extremely long” working hours, some of whom had tried to raise concerns within the NHS about how it is impacting care. “Some of them were really heartbreaking, with stories of real harm coming to midwives and women,” she said. “Midwives, community midwives especially, are being asked to work all day and then being called out overnight, not just for home births but also over short staffing within the main hospital unit. They’re often working all night, and then some the next day are even expected to work all day as well. “This is inhumane, unsafe, completely unacceptable and in very sharp contrast to other safety-critical and historically male-dominated roles such as bus and lorry driving, rail driving, pilots and air traffic controllers, who have very strict protections on the number of hours they can work.” She is calling for midwives to have similar legal restrictions imposed on their working hours, such as protections preventing them from having less than 11 hours in between shifts. “For midwives, it would be absolutely transformative, because they’ve suffered real serious physical and mental harm from working these shift patterns,” she said. “I’ve had an alarming number of stories from midwives who’ve crashed their cars on their way home from work because of excessive fatigue, who have inadvertently harmed women and babies because they’ve known they’ve been too tired to work and they’ve asked to be relieved and that’s been refused.” She added: “For women and people having babies, it would just give them the confidence that the people looking after them can bring their A-game, are really well rested, are safe, and are supported to do the job that they’ve been trained to do.” Midwifery is covered by the UK’s working time regulations, which mean employees shouldn’t work more than 48 hours a week and should have 11 hours in between shifts. However, midwives have said their on-call shifts and pressure due to short staffing mean these rules are regularly overlooked. Some midwives, such as Millie*, have been pushed into leaving the profession altogether by the excessive working hours and pressures. The 33-year-old recalled a shift she worked as a midwife on bank (flexible/temporary shifts), where at the end of her shift at 1.30am, she was told she could not go home due to short staffing. She worked a further eight hours, until 8.30am, having not slept for over 24 hours. “That shift pushed me into one of the deepest holes I’ve ever fallen into. I remember doing another IV drip at about 6am and just breaking down,” she said. “It’s so difficult, but you just have to get on with it, because if anything happens to that labouring woman, you have to be there. I’ve cried in cupboards and splashed cold water in my face to keep it together.” Speaking about the petition, she said she believes restrictions on working hours may make it less likely that other midwives leave the profession, adding it will “make mistakes less likely” and that “people using the service will automatically benefit because we will benefit because we’ll be safer and rested”. The comments from midwives come after a renewed focus on maternity services, as a damning review earlier this month found women have been left to “bleed out” in bathrooms and babies have suffered avoidable deaths in NHS maternity units. have been “too slow” despite being necessary and urgent in her initial findings. The report highlights a number of issues which Baroness Amos said she has “heard about consistently”. These include women not being listened to, not being given the right information to make informed choices about their care, and discrimination against women of colour, working-class women, younger parents and women with mental health problems. Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said midwives are facing “extreme pressures” and are “exhausted, overstretched and working in unsustainable conditions”. “The fundamental issue is that you cannot deliver safe maternity care with exhausted and overstretched staff. Well-rested midwives who have manageable workloads provide better, safer care,” she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “There are legal limits to working hours to protect staff and their patients from unsafe conditions, and any circumstance where employers are contravening this is unacceptable. “The secretary of state has ordered a rapid, independent investigation into maternity and neonatal services to understand deep-rooted issues, led by Baroness Amos. “It will seek to understand the experiences of staff and healthcare professionals working across maternity and how they can be better supported to provide high-quality, safe and compassionate care.” An NHS spokesperson said: “NHS terms and conditions set out clear requirements on working hours, rest breaks and shift patterns. Trusts are expected to have robust local policies in place to comply with working-time regulations and support staff wellbeing.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Crucial peace talks are set to take place between discussions between Kyiv, Washington, Moscow, and Brussels, as world leaders attempt to broker a deal that would bring the nearly four-year conflict between Ukraine and Russia to an end. Also earlier this month, Ukrainian president Mr Zelensky emerged from talks in Berlin, flanked by his European allies, with a The US is now offering Nato-style protections, meaning the main barrier to peace is territory - something Mr Zelensky says he cannot and will not give up. Mr Zelensky has said he believes the plan is “90 per cent complete”, and is hoping that the details can be finalised during talks on Sunday. , which has yet to comment on all the details of the proposals. has so far remained unyielding, shooting down any prospect of giving back land or accepting peacekeepers in Ukraine, before seeing the proposals. Below, we look at what we know about the plan so far and its potential problems. Mr Zelensky offered to give up on Ukraine’s ambitions to join Nato as he held five hours of intense talks with US negotiators on 14 December. Mr Trump has opposed the idea since taking office, and it may not have been on the table for some time. But security experts say it shows the US Mr Zelensky’s approach to negotiating in good faith. Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy adviser in the Obama administration, said it was “a way for Zelensky to contrast Ukraine’s willingness for significant concessions for peace at a time when Moscow has been short on any significant concessions”. Ukraine is still asking for clear security guarantees, which Europe has offered to front with a ‘multinational force’ made up of Coalition of the Willing members and supported by the US. With “90 per cent” of the issues with the draft plan now resolved, Washington finally offered Ukraine safeguards modelled on Nato’s Article 5 clause on collective defence, according to US officials. It was an unprecedented victory for Kyiv, with both Ukraine and European leaders arguing that guarantees must come before any talk of land swaps. Details are still scarce, and it is unclear what kind of response the US would be committed to should Russia break the peace. US officials said it was the “platinum standard”, but would not be on offer forever. Russia still says it will not accept what it calls Nato peacekeepers in Ukraine under any circumstances. Ukraine is bound by its constitution not to give up any land, and Mr Zelensky has insisted he is not willing or able to give up the land Russia demands. The US delegation still believes there is room for movement. One official said after talks that their side still feels “really good about the progress that we've made, including on territories”. They said Mr Zelensky will now relay some “thought-provoking ideas” produced by the US to his team. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov previously said Moscow was unwilling to make any concessions on the Donbas, Crimea or ‘Novorossiya’, an imperial distinction for the land north of the Black Sea. But he was positive about progress made in talks prior to Christmas. ""I think 25 December 2025 will remain in all our memories as a milestone when we truly came close to a solution,” he told Russian state TV on Boxing Day. “But whether we can make the final push and reach an agreement depends on our work and the political will of the other side.” Mr Zelensky hailed progress but acknowledged in comments to reporters that the issue “is a painful one, because Russia wants what it wants, and we can't go any further”. US officials said before Christmas that Russia would accept Ukraine joining the EU as part of their agreement to end the war. A senior source told the AFP news agency that they could see Ukraine joining as soon as January 2027, but diplomats in Brussels said the idea was “unrealistic”. The issue remains controversial in parts of Europe, but the bloc would back the move. Top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas last month that Ukraine’s membership would be a “major security guarantee” in its own right. One of the 28 points included in the original US draft - since whittled down to 20 - was the idea of sharing power produced at Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Russia has held the Zaporizhzhia plant since the start of the war. A US official said following the Berlin talks that they were close to finding an agreement whereby both sides could share power, though it is not clear how this would work in practice.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Although Italy has no shortage of enchanting holiday destinations – , to name just a few – there’s something particularly magical about Tuscany. This is a region that often seems to be bathed in a soft golden light, with gently sloping hills and beautiful You could easily spend your days exploring Florence and Pisa, or wandering through the narrow streets and central piazza of Siena. But perhaps the greatest experience in Tuscany is discovering the many medieval hilltop towns scattered through the countryside. From the famous towers of San Gimignano and charming Pienza to Greve in the wine-making region of Chianti, there are plenty of towns and villages to discover, all with their own unique charms and within easy driving distance of one another. Here are seven of our favourites. San Gimignano is one of the best known small towns in Tuscany – and for good reason. With its hilltop location, charming local restaurants and picture-perfect setting, it’s a favourite among tourists. Visitors can stroll through the medieval streets, stop in at one of the many small shops, gaze at the town’s impressive cathedral and visit the civic museum at the Palazzo del Popolo. There’s a fun story behind San Gimignano’s famous towers. Between the 11th and the 13th centuries, the noble families who controlled the town believed their towers were a sign of wealth and power to their political and economic rivals, and so kept building more and more – it is believed that a total of 72 could be found in San Gimignano at its peak. Only 14 have survived, but they’re still rather impressive and give the town a palpable sense of history. Vegan Agrivilla I Pini, a pilgrim shelter turned vegan eco farmhouse, is a hotel with rustic rooms and a plant-based farm kitchen. Surrounded by rolling vineyards and olive groves, the hotel’s 11 lodgings are elegantly minimal to help you find your inner sanctuary. Montalcino is an excellent choice for wine lovers – it’s well known for its brunello di montalcino and rosso di montalcino wines. The location in the hills of the Val d’Orcia gives it an even more rustic setting than other towns on this list. Visitors will find themselves surrounded by countryside dotted with cypress trees and flowers, as well as rolling olive groves and vineyards. Tourists can climb the fortress walls, amble through the winding streets and spend some time on the town’s Piazza del Popolo – but no visitor should miss the wine tastings which can be enjoyed in and around the town. Perched just above the town, Borgo Canalicchio di Sopra Relais offers an authentic way to embrace the region’s speciality with copious opportunities to try the estate’s wines. After wine tastings, vineyard and cellar tours, cool off at the resort’s idyllic pools. Pienza also lies in the Val d’Orcia, where gently rolling hills are populated by Renaissance towns, vineyards and medieval castles. The town itself is surrounded by medieval walls, inside of which is a maze of pretty cobbled streets lined with typical Tuscan houses. From the town you can enjoy amazing views over the hills and olive groves, and in the distance sits Mount Amiata. All roads in this town lead to the Pio II plaza, with particularly picturesque streets including the Via dell’Amore and Via del Bacio. The town’s cathedral sits in this square, as do Palazzo Piccolomini and Palazzo Borgia, which houses the town’s museum. Just a stone’s throw from Pienza’s cathedral, history runs throughout the impressive Relais Il Chiostro Di Pienza. A former Franciscan convent, the hotel’s rooms are architecturally spectacular, completed with a garden terrace overlooking the Val d’Orcia. A visit to Tuscany is arguably not complete without a visit to Chianti, the region’s famous wine-producing area. Greve in Chianti is one of the more scenic towns in this part of Tuscany – it’s centred around the triangular Piazza Matteotti, the porticos of which hide vendors of various fresh produce. In the foothills just below Greve in Chianti lies Montefioralle, one of the oldest villages in Tuscany. It’s still enclosed by its original defensive walls, and its (nearly) car-free centre is a great place for a relaxed stroll. The surrounding vineyards will likely be the focus of your visit, but be sure to climb up the hills to the highest point in the village where you can see the Santo Stefano church and take in a sweeping view of the vineyards, olive groves and cypress trees. With bright furnishings and painted beams, each room in the luxury wine resort Borgo Del Cabreo is elegant and charming. Guests can enjoy homemade treats at breakfast before strolling to Greve in Chianti or booking an on-site cooking class to discover traditional Tuscan recipes. Volterra was once a mighty Etruscan city, but nowadays it is best known for Italian handicrafts and remnants of its medieval past. It is dominated by its Duomo along with the Palazzo dei Priori and 13th-century palazzo, though the 2,000-year-old Roman amphitheatre is another highlight. Remnants of its Etruscan past remain in the 5th-century Porta all’Arco walls and the Guarnacci Etruscan Museum, while the smaller Pinacoteca museum focuses on art from between the 14th and 17th century. Just outside (15km) of the town itself, Borgo Pignano Volterra is perched on a hilltop with sweeping views across the Tuscan countryside. This 18th-century villa sits in 750 acres of countryside, with two pools (one of which is carved into the rock), an excellent restaurant focused on local produce and a range of activities, including horse riding around the estate, wine tasting (including the hotel’s own grapes), and artisanal workshops. Pitigliano is located in the Maremma region near the Tuscan coast. It’s another hilltop town, and features rows of sandstone buildings built on top of volcanic red “tuff” stone. As well as enjoying wine tastings, tourists can amble through the mazy streets, stop for a drink or bite to eat around the lovely Piazza del Popolo, explore the palace-fortress of Palazzo Orsini (and its museum) and visit the Sette Cannelle fountain. This town is also known as “Little Jerusalem” as a large Jewish population resided there until around the time of the Second World War, and there are several remnants of its religious history still present, from an old Jewish Quarter – now with a Jewish museum – to a gilded synagogue. Cross the ancient drawbridge to fairytale rooms and romantic courtyard at Hotel della Fortezza. Located in the neighbouring Sorano, the former 12th-century fortress offers a delightful way to explore both historic towns. Pietrasanta still retains some of the artistic creativity that was associated with it in bygone times when artists such as Michelangelo frequented the town. Today it has one of the highest concentrations of art galleries in any Italian town, from the Favret MosaiciArtistici to the Flora Bigae gallery of contemporary art. Pietrasanta is located very close to the coast, near upmarket resorts like Forte dei Marmi, and so is a town influenced by both local history and modern tourism. Away from the beaches, the highlights include the Duomo and the Rocca di Sala fortress, while an archaeological museum, marble quarry and yearly performing arts festival (La Versiliana) are a little more off the beaten track. Overlooking a 100-year-old citrus grove, Orangerie prizes a central location and rooms finished with local antiques. Guests can wake up to breakfast under the orange trees, before stepping out to enjoy the town’s cultural delights.",The Independent,The Independent

Read our A paramedic has been struck off after a professional tribunal found she fabricated a family illness to secure a day off, with her deception exposed by her sister's social media posts. Natalie Twomey emailed her London Ambulance Service (LAS) bosses claiming that her sister’s health had “deteriorated again” and she needed to drive to Norfolk. However, LAS staff discovered photos on her sister’s Facebook account of her house decorated for Christmas, posted that same day. A panel deemed this “inconsistent” with the sister being so ill that Ms Twomey needed to visit her. The Health and Care Professions Tribunal’s written judgment stated Ms Twomey told a ""lie"" to ""mislead"" her employer, calling it ""deceit"" for ""personal gain."" The panel was told that Ms Twomey sent an email to her bosses on 28 November 2022 saying: “I’ve had to phone in sick, my sister has deteriorated again and had to drive back to Norfolk to be with her.” The panel heard that the LAS discovered a post on Ms Twomey’s sister’s Facebook account which contained pictures of a house decorated for Christmas on 28 November. When the paramedic was asked about the posts during a capability meeting in April 2023, she said that her sister was in an ITU (intensive therapy unit) and that her sister’s husband was responsible for posts made on his wife’s Facebook account. The panel found that Ms Twomey knew her sister was not sick on 28 November, and said she had “deliberately provided misleading information to her employer to excuse her absence from work”. “The message conveyed by the photographs of Christmas decorations was inconsistent with the registrant’s sister being sick to the extent that the registrant had to drive to Norfolk to be with her, rather than attend to her responsibilities at work,” they found. The paramedic was removed from front-line duties in June 2023 after she attended work while smelling of alcohol. But it was heard that while renewing her registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) regulator, she did not inform them that restrictions had been placed upon her practice. Ms Twomey also sent an email to the LAS’s recruitment department to discuss a secondment and claimed that the reason she was on non-patient facing duties was due to a back and knee injury. The paramedic also provided false information relating to her working hours in 2023. Ms Twomey was dismissed from the LAS at the end of 2023 due to her “capability and failure to attend work regularly”. The panel heard that during a job interview afterwards, she claimed she had never been subject to any disciplinary hearings, and had never been dismissed. She also said that there were no outstanding investigations against her despite being aware there was an ongoing HCPC investigation into her fitness to practise. While undertaking duties as a paramedic at a police investigation centre in April 2024, a police officer smelt alcohol on her breath and she was required to provide a breath test. The paramedic had arrived at the site by car and she was arrested and cautioned. Ms Twomey was convicted of a driving offence at Ipswich Magistrates’ Court in April 2024 after pleading guilty to driving a motor vehicle over the prescribed limit. The panel found that Ms Twomey’s conduct was “sufficiently serious to amount to misconduct”, and removed her name from the register. “The panel concluded that the appropriate and proportionate sanction in this case was a Striking Off Order,” they said.",The Independent,The Independent
https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/train-fares-southern-contactless-payment-b2891036.html,Some train passengers face soaring fares with new contactless payment rules,2025-12-27T22:15:02.000Z,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Train fares on some services have soared following the expansion of contactless payment systems, prompting concerns that passengers could be priced off the railways. Rebecca Paul, the Conservative MP for Reigate, said that the new rules risk “pricing passengers out of rail altogether”. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), the train operator, said that many passengers would save money and insisted the process was not designed to increase fares revenue. Contactless ticketing, which enables people to pay by tapping a bank card or device on readers, avoiding manual ticket purchases, was introduced to 30 more stations in south-east England on 14 December as part of the Department for Transport’s Project Oval. The price increases are a direct result of changes to paper ticketing time restrictions, which have been aligned with Transport for London’s contactless structure. Consequently, services that could previously be used with an off-peak ticket now require a more expensive peak ticket. The first weekday London-bound Southern service from Reigate, Surrey, that can be boarded with an off-peak day travelcard ticket now departs at 9.28am, compared with 8.58am previously. But when the 8.58am train calls at Redhill just five minutes later, passengers are still able to board it with an off-peak ticket. A day travelcard that can be used at any time from the stations costs £37.10, whereas an off-peak version is £20.60. One member of the Reigate, Redhill and District Rail Users’ Association (RRDRUA) described the situation as “ridiculous” and said he will cycle to Redhill to save money. There are also new restrictions on travel between 4pm and 7pm. Ms Paul said she has been contacted by “a number of residents who are understandably frustrated” by the expansion of contactless. She went on: “This change should make rail travel easier, not more expensive or confusing. “Reigate passengers deserve the benefits of modern ticketing, but I will not stand by while my constituents face higher fares and fewer affordable travel options. “Many people rely on off-peak travel to keep costs down and quietly narrowing the definition of what counts as off-peak risks pricing passengers out of rail altogether.” Ms Paul pledged to continue to press GTR – the parent company of Southern and Thameslink – and the DfT to “ensure that the introduction of contactless does not result in passengers paying more for the same journeys”. The rollout of contactless has also led to the cheapest super off-peak tickets being removed from some stations. Steve Trigg, an RRDRUA organiser, said that some families visiting the capital are being forced to alter their schedules or face an 85 per cent cost increase to return at peak times. He said the changes have resulted in a “complex situation” and caused “massive problems because the DfT won’t talk with ordinary people using the services”. Analysis by lobby group Railfuture said passengers paying by contactless will be charged up to twice as much as those using paper tickets for some journeys. This is because discounts for railcards or children cannot be registered with contactless. A family of two adults and two children travelling from Luton to central London at a weekend will be charged a total of £84 if they use contactless, but just £41.70 if they buy tickets from operator Thameslink and select a free Groupsave discount. A commuter travelling to the capital from East Grinstead, West Sussex, at peak times could save £3.60 every day buying paper tickets with a £35 Network Railcard. Neil Middleton, Railfuture vice chair, said: “Offering the option for contactless payment for rail travel is a good thing – convenient and simple. “But it currently comes with a number of stings in the tail, so if a traveller wants to pay the lowest price for their travel, contactless payment often doesn’t deliver the best price.” At the time of the expansion of contactless, rail minister Lord Hendy said it would ensure “passengers can get the best fares”. Railfuture advised passengers wanting to know the cheapest payment method for their journey to check their train operator’s website and Transport for London’s single fare finder web page. A GTR spokesperson said contactless makes planning and paying for train travel “quicker and easier”, and earlier phases of its rollout have been “hugely popular with passengers”. He went on: “To introduce pay as you go with contactless, we have to align the way fares are structured with those of the wider TfL contactless system. “Peak and off-peak timing has to match with the TfL system as well. “We understand how, for some people, this means fares will rise, but for many others they will fall. “Overall, these changes are not designed to increase the amount of money generated from ticket sales.” GTR provided examples of savings for Reigate passengers, such as a passenger making a single journey at weekday off-peak times paying £7.60 compared with £14.60 previously. It added that a commuter who travels before 6.30am and returns either before 4pm or after 7pm can save £11.60, as their total fare is reduced from £26.80 to £15.20. A DfT spokesperson said: “Contactless ticketing means passengers are benefiting from simpler, more flexible travel and the majority of single tickets will be the same price or even lower. “We have brought ticketing in line with London’s ‘best price promise’ to make it easier for passengers, so they can be confident they have the best fare on the day of travel.”",The Independent,The Independent

The sentiment was echoed by Cabinet ministers including Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Justice Secretary David Lammy with similar posts. , a charity which represents Jewish organisations across the UK, criticised the “effusive welcome” from the UK government, while senior Tory said Sir Keir’s “endorsement” of Mr Abd El-Fattah showed poor judgment given past social media posts that appear to show “extremist” views. Mr Abd El-Fattah, a British-Egyptian dual national, was detained in Egypt in September 2019, and in December 2021 was sentenced to five years in prison on charges of spreading false news. His imprisonment was branded a breach of international law by UN investigators, and Mr Abd El-Fattah was released after he was pardoned by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi. Labour’s Conservative predecessors had also lobbied for the release of Mr Abd El-Fattah, who was a leading voice in Egypt’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising and went on hunger strikes behind bars. Sir Keir wrote on X: “I’m delighted that Alaa Abd El-Fattah is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment. “Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office. I’m grateful to President Sisi for his decision to grant the pardon.” Shadow justice secretary Mr Jenrick said the remarks constitute a “personal, public endorsement” from the Prime Minister. “Given Mr Abd El-Fattah’s record of extremist statements about violence, Jews and the police, it was a serious error of judgment,” he wrote. Mr Jenrick referred to posts online going back as far as 2010 that appeared to be from Mr Abd El-Fattah’s X account but could not be verified by the Press Association. They include several posts that appear to call for violence towards “zionists” and the police. In 2014, the blogger’s posts on Twitter cost him a nomination for the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize. The group backing him withdrew the nomination for the human rights award, saying they had discovered a tweet from 2012 in which he called for the murder of Israelis. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Jenrick asked him to clarify whether he knew about Mr Abd El-Fattah’s statements before he posted that he was “delighted” at his release. “Do you condemn them without qualification, including the endorsement of killing Israelis and ‘zionists’ and the calls to kill police and burn Downing Street?” He asked if the Prime Minister would “correct the record” and withdraw the “unalloyed endorsement”. “Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily, nor for peaceful dissent. But neither should the Prime Minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed,” he said. The Jewish Leadership Council also voiced concerns in the wake of recent antisemitic attacks in Manchester and at Australia’s Bondi Beach. The council said: “We are appalled by the effusive welcome Alaa Abd El-Fattah has received from the UK government. “The Prime Minister recently reiterated his determination to root out antisemitism from our country but has now shared his delight that someone who has advocated for killing Zionists has arrived in the UK. “We know from Heaton Park, Manchester and Bondi Beach that there are those who hear such words as a call to action. “The Government has celebrated Mr Abd El-Fattah’s arrival as a victory, British Jews will see it as yet another reminder of the danger we face.”",The Independent,The Independent

Read our Voters went to the polls Sunday for the initial phase of Myanmar ’s first general election in five years, held under the supervision of its military government while a civil war rages throughout much of the country.

Her party won a landslide victory in the 2020 election but was blocked from taking office for a second term. , the country’s largest city, Naypyitaw, the capital, and elsewhere voters were casting their ballots at high schools, government buildings and religious buildings. Critics argue that the results will lack legitimacy due to the exclusion of major parties and limits on freedom of speech and an atmosphere of repression. They contend that the expected victory of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party makes the nominal transition to civilian rule a chimera. However, holding the election may provide an excuse for neighbors like China, India and to continue their support, claiming the election promotes stability. Western nations have maintained sanctions against Myanmar’s ruling generals due to their anti-democratic actions and the brutal war against their opponents. in Yangon, the country’s largest city, had visibly stiffened on Saturday, with armed guards stationed outside polling stations and military trucks patrolling the roads.

Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s 80-year-old former leader, is not participating as she serves a 27-year prison term on charges widely viewed as politically motivated. Her party, the National League for Democracy, was dissolved in 2023 after refusing to register under new military rules. Other parties also refused to register or declined to run under conditions they deem unfair, and opposition groups have called for a voter boycott. Amael Vier, an analyst for the Asian Network for Free Elections, noted a lack of genuine choice, pointing out that 73% of voters in 2020 cast ballots for parties that no longer exist. Mobilizing opposition is difficult under the military’s repression. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 22,000 people are currently detained for political offenses, and over 7,600 civilians have been killed by security forces since they seized power in 2021. Armed resistance arose after the army used lethal force to crush non-violent protests against its 2021 takeover. The ensuing civil war has left more than 3.6 million people displaced, according to the U.N. A new Election Protection Law has added harsh penalties and restrictions, effectively barring all public criticism of the polls. U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk has stated that Myanmar is witnessing intensified violence and intimidation, noting that there are no conditions for the exercise of freedom of expression or peaceful assembly.

The Home Office said those countries had frustrated efforts to remove thousands of illegal migrants and criminals. It said they had ""unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes"" and accused the countries of refusing to process paperwork and requiring individuals to sign their own documents - effectively allowing them to block their own deportations. Angola and Namibia have now agreed to new processes, under which the UK will be able to return illegal migrants and foreign national offenders in the coming months, the Home Office said. The UK has revoked fast-track visa processing and halted preferential visa treatment for diplomats and VIPs from the DRC as a warning after it failed to make changes. There has since been some engagement from the country but Ms Mahmood has again warned she is willing to take further action. A government source said the home secretary ""won't hesitate to go further and ban visas to other countries who refuse to take their citizens back"". Ms Mahmood said: ""We expect countries to play by the rules. If one of their citizens has no right to be here, they must take them back. ""I thank Angola and Namibia and welcome their co-operation. Now is the time for the Democratic Republic of Congo to do the right thing. Take your citizens back or lose the privilege of entering our country. ""This is just the start of the measures I am taking to secure our border and ramp up the removal of those with no right to be here."" Ms Mahmood unveiled sweeping reforms last month aimed at deterring migrants from seeking asylum in the UK and making it easier to remove people with no right to be in the country. The three countries threatened with a visa ban are not among the most common nationalities of migrants to enter the UK legally or illegally. They accounted for a tiny proportion of the more than 800,000 visas granted for employment, study, family or humanitarian reasons in the year to June - 299 to those from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 273 for nationals from Angola and 140 for those from Namibia. And they made up only a handful of the illegal migrants recorded as having entered the UK through so-called ""irregular"" routes in that timeframe, with only 11 coming from the DRC, three from Angola and none from Namibia. Foreign secretary Yvette Cooper has told British diplomats to take a more transactional approach to illegal migration as part of efforts to speed up returns. She said: ""I have instructed our diplomatic network around the world to make returns a top priority, and today's announcement shows that when countries work with us, we can achieve more rapid results. ""People who come to the UK illegally, overstay their visas, or commit crimes in our country should expect to be returned, and we will continue to demand the cooperation of their governments in that process.""

Read our officials believed the September 11 attacks would impact how US politicians viewed the One day after the terror attacks which killed more than 2,900 people and injured thousands more, a Government official put together a briefing document on its potential impacts on the peace process. While noting it was “very early days” to assess the consequences on the foreign policy of the administration, the official predicted that the US could not enter a prolonged period of introspection where matters of internal security and dealing with terrorism would “dominate the agenda for a long time to come”. Several US legislators had taken a keen interest and been involved in work towards the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, as well as subsequent efforts to maintain the peace deal. The official predicted that the peace process would have to compete for space on the US foreign policy agenda, while noting that the war on terrorism may cause US legislators to take a more “exacting approach” with republicans in Northern Ireland due to the “whiff of cordite”. The Government official advised that this be considered in any plans for engagements in a review of the Good Friday Agreement, as well as the timing for any planned visits to Washington DC. The briefing document, published as part of the annual release of Government documents from the National Archives of Ireland, notes former US president Mr Bush’s comments that his government would “make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbour them” as a potential “precursor of this zero-tolerance approach to terrorism which may now drive US foreign and defence policy”. The official said it was likely that US foreign policy would now be “largely driven by the imperative of the war against international terrorism”, and would see an environment where security-focused policy advice coming from the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the intelligence agencies would “completely out-trump any more sophisticated or nuanced analysis of conflict resolution situations” from the State Department or National Security Council. “It is likely, therefore, that defeating terrorism will become a central organising principle for US policy for some time to come. “In this regard, US policy makers may not be inclined to make fine distinctions between different varieties of ‘terrorist’ organisation; between their various stages of transition from paramilitaries to politicians; or between the political and military wings of insurrectionary movements.” The document states that while the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks were associated with the “Middle East/Islamic elements”, this will “not insulate the republican movement from much more rigorous and critical scrutiny in an environment which increasingly lumps together, as the enemy, all shades of ‘terrorism’.” The document predicted republicans may experience a “very chilly” and “more hostile environment” in the US if it did not take quicker action on disarmament – which began shortly thereafter – and clarify its position on the Colombian guerilla group FARC. It states: “The republican movement’s attempts to prevent itself from being so branded will be seriously undermined by (a) its perceived failure to meet its commitments on illegal arms and (b) more especially, its recent associations with the FARC. “Since the beginning of the peace process, the Irish-American caucus in Congress has, with minor exceptions, been supportive of the republican movement’s progressive engagement with democratic politics, notwithstanding its militant past. “With both sides of Congress now apparently sharing the administration’s view that the US is at war with terrorism, Irish-American Congressmen may now feel the need to adopt a more exacting approach in their dealings with the republican movement. “The ‘whiff of cordite’ dimension (albeit at a respectable distance from its militant past) has contributed to the celebrity status of the Sinn Fein leadership in the US and to their appeal among Irish-America. “In the very different ‘Attack on America’ environment which now pertains in the US, that same dimension may now become a drag on Sinn Fein’s respectability and access.” wrote to Mr Bush to express Ireland’s “deep and heartfelt condolences” to the American people. “I am deeply shocked and enormously saddened by the terrible and evil events that have occurred in the United States,” he wrote. “I utterly condemn these horrendous and unprecedented attacks. “It is difficult to come to terms with the scale of this dreadful outrage but our hearts go out to the American people as they try to come to grips with it.” The file also shows that Irish officials were monitoring comments by US figures in the weeks after the attacks, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer referring to the IRA while responding to a question on which organisations would be targeted in the war on terrorism – but later clarified the US would be limiting action to groups that threatened the US. – This article is based on documents contained in the file labelled 2023/50/525 in the National Archives of Ireland.",The Independent,The Independent
